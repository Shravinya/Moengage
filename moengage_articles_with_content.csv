What is a Beta Release?,https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005943283-Feature-or-Product-in-Beta,"User Guide 
Getting Started 
Overview
Feature or Product in Beta

The Beta tag around a product or feature indicates that the respective product or feature is not released to the public, but is an open or closed beta release.

What is a Beta Release?

MoEngage does a beta release when the product feature is complete and all the development is done but the feature may have some bugs and performance issues. This release is mostly done for users who want to test the product, use it cautiously, and report bugs.

What is a Closed or Open Beta Release?

When the product or feature in beta is exposed to all the customers, it is called an Open Beta Release. When the product or feature in beta is exposed only to a limited or closed group of customers, it is called a Closed Beta Release.

What does a Beta Feature Mean for MoEngage Users?

If you are seeing any beta product or feature, you are among the users or clients who would have either requested the feature, or the Product team at MoEngage would have considered the product or feature relevant to you.

You must be cautious while using any beta feature because it might have some low-impact bugs that might have escaped testing (QA). It will be great if you report any bugs or performance issues that you face while using the product or features in beta. It will help MoEngage to improve your experience and deliver a bug-free product.

Live and Test environments

Your MoEngage account has two different environments, Test and Live, with a single Workspace ID (available under Settings > Account > General settings) that is used as a MoEngage identifier.

The MoEngage SDKs (Android, iOS, and Web) direct the user data or event data to:

The Test environment when the build is DEBUG
The Live environment when the build is RELEASE

When you integrate an app or web for the first time or update it, you can test all new changes, such as event tracking, in the Test environment and update the app or release the web in the Live environment. 

When you begin integrating any MoEngage SDKs, all your testing of user data or events data is visible in the Test environment. This enables you to test your integration and verify data before you go live or release your app or web.

You can switch between Live and Test environments by selecting the environment on the top navigation bar.

info	

Information

Apart from Team management, Billing, and your Profile settings, all other settings are separate for the Test and Live environments and available in the sidebar.

Test Environment

The following are the advantages of the Test environment:

All team members added to the Test environment have all feature permissions in the Test environment. Everyone can experiment with different scenarios.
All test data in the Test environment is processed and reflected faster, which saves time during initial integration and makes debugging easier.
You can easily maintain and test different settings—Push FC, Event Trigger DND, Uninstalls—for Test and Live environments without any mutual impact.
Live Environment

After you complete integration and decide to release your app or take your website live, mobile SDKs of MoEngage will detect the RELEASE build and send all live user data or event data to the Live environment.

The Live environment has feature restrictions for different access roles to prevent any mistakes or changes by any of your team members that can impact live user data and campaigns:

Developers must specifically mark certain users as test users before they can create campaigns or run any segmentation queries in the Live environment. For more information, refer to Test Users in LIVE Environment.
Developers cannot change Push FC and DND settings in the Live environment.

Migrate to MoEngage
Migrate or Transfer Push Tokens
Introduction

Brand Marketers transitioning from other platforms to MoEngage want to migrate their historical user-device data to the MoEngage platform to start leveraging the platform's capabilities to the fullest extent without any delay. As part of the transition process, the end-users of the brand need to upgrade to the new version of the brand-app which is integrated with MoEngage SDK. This typically involves a delay as the entire user-base of the brand slowly moves to the new version. 

This article provides you with information on various methods that can assist you in seamlessly migrating the historical data of your users and their devices to MoEngage using server-to-server APIs. These methods simplify your migration journey, making it more convenient.

Use Cases 

For a brand/business with a substantial user base, it takes time for all users to transition to the upgraded app version, delaying reaping the benefits of the platform. However, for users who have already installed the updated app version that includes the MoEngage SDK, it begins tracking their data immediately.
This gives rise to some scenarios, as mentioned below, and this article provides the solution for each scenario:

Scenario 1:

Users who have not upgraded to the latest app version integrated with MoEngage SDK cannot receive push notifications triggered from MoEngage platform.

Solution: Push token migration using Track Device API

Because a substantial user-base have not yet upgraded to the latest app version, MoEngage SDK cannot yet track their user-device properties and events. Instead of waiting for the entire user base to update their apps to the version which is integrated with the MoEngage SDK, you can use the Track Device API to import Push tokens already available to you into MoEngage. Track Device API or Bulk Import API helps you to create/update devices of existing users. 

Using Track device API, you can seamlessly migrate the already available device information with you, such as Push token, GAID/ IDFV and platform information into MoEngage. MoEngage validates and accepts unique values of Push token, GAID/IDFV and platform of every device attached to the user. 

Once above device information is ingested successfully into MoEngage, you can trigger Push campaigns from the MoEngage platform. 

info	

Information

This method of Push notification delivery by migrating device attributes using Device API and sending push campaigns from the MoEngage platform is applicable only to iOS devices. Android devices with later versions of AndroidOS still require MoEngage SDK to render Push notifications. Further, such notifications will launch the app but will not be able to redirect to a specific page in the app, please frame the title, subtitle and message content of the push notification accordingly.

Although Push notifications will be delivered for iOS devices, corresponding campaign stats such as Push notification clicked will not be tracked as these events are tracked by MoEngage SDK which may not be integrated with the app version used by end-users during migration.

Scenario 2:

Nudge users to upgrade to the latest app version integrated with MoEngage SDK by effectively targeting them.

Solution: Migrate User Device Information Using Bulk Import API

As a marketer, you can create users and their devices using the Bulk Import API of MoEngage. You can then assign a custom user attribute with a corresponding value to indicate users who should be notified about the app version upgrade. 
For example, consider the custom user attribute bulk_migration and its value to be set to true for the users who have not upgraded to the latest app version. You can use this custom user attribute to create a segment, as explained below: 

Create a Segment

Perform the following steps to create a segment that contains the users who have not performed the app upgrade:

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Segment > Create segment.
Click Filter users by, and then click the User property tab.
In the Select attribute list, select the custom user attribute you created to mark the migrated users. In this use case, the custom user attribute is bulk_migration set to true.

Perform the remaining steps to create the segment. For more information, refer to Create Segments.

After creating the segment, you can send campaigns to target the users in this segment and nudge them to upgrade to the latest app version integrated with MoEngage SDK."

Integration
Test users

The 'Test Users' feature allows marketers to build and organize test groups and provide insights into the SDK or API logs available from a test device during SDK integration testing. Once a user is marked as a test user, their data will be processed in near real time to allow you to test your data tracking in Moengage. You can view the data tracked for test users in user profile and recent events. 

You can mark up to 1000 users as test users. 

Steps
Add new test users 

1. Go to Test and Debug at the bottom of your sidebar


2. Click ""+ Test user "" on the top right to mark users as test users. 


3. You can either mark all the users in the custom segment as Test users or select one or more specific users. 

3. a) Select custom segment
    i) If you want to mark all users from a custom segment, click on the ""Select custom segment"" card. 

    ii) Select your desired custom segment from the drop-down.  

    iii)You can also run a query to see the count of the users in the selected segment. 

    iv) Click on Mark as Test to mark these users as test users. 

Note: Anonymous users in the custom segment will not get added as test users since they do not have Client ID / UID. You can add anonymous users as test users via GAID 

3. b) Select users

    i) Click the ""Select users"" card if you want to mark some selected users as test users. 

    ii) You can select one of the user identifiers from the drop-down. 

    iii) Enter user detail or a comma-separated list in case of multiple users.

    iv) Click on Mark as Test to mark these users as test users.

Note: 

1. When we add via Client id, the users are added as ""Test User"", thus their device ID is not shown in the Test Users dashboard ( where all test users are displayed)

2. When we add via GAID, the devices are added as ""Test Device"". On the test users' dashboard, both users and device details are shown. 

 

 

4. Once you click on 'Mark as test', users in the selected segments or selected users would be marked as Test users. And you will see the user details in the slide-out.


Note - In case some of the users failed, you will see the failure details in the same slide-out. 

Mark test users from the user profile 

If you are already on a user profile and want to mark that user as a Test user, click mark as a test user on the top right. 

Note: Only registered users can be added as a ""Test User"" from the user profile page, not the anonymous user. 


Access test users  

1. Go to Test and Debug at the bottom of your sidebar


2. The page will show the details of all the test users. 

Access user profile

You can click on the MoEngage user id to go to the user profile page. 

View recent events 

1. Once you select one or more users, you will see an option (just below the search bar) to see the recent events for the selected users. Click View recent events. 

Note: We can select up to 5 users and view recent events of those users.


2. The slide-out will show the recent 10 events for the selected users. Note: In the slide-out, we show a maximum of 10 events( of the last 24 hours) for each user."

Integration Checklist

To make sure that you extract maximum benefit for your app/website from MoEngage, we list some of the essential building blocks to be used during integrations that can enable a world of features for you to use and enrich the experience of your customers through the right engagement campaigns. You can read more about SDK integration in our docs here.

Track all User Attributes, Events and Event Attributes

It is recommended to track all the user attributes, events & event attributes exhaustively so that all your use-cases get covered and you can make effective use of our powerful segmentation features.

Also, track Conversion goals and Attributes

Conversion goal help in attributing the success of a campaign to a particular goal such as Purchasing an item, booking a ticket etc. As part of tracking events and their attributes, it is recommended to consider and track such events as potential conversion goals for monitoring campaign performance. Along with conversion goal events, their attributes can help in quantifying the goal achievement such as total revenue earned, total bookings done etc. You can then understand which campaigns are doing better in terms of conversion goal events and understand consumer behaviour better.

Enable Deep-linking and define Screen Names

You should also enable deep-linking and define all the activities or screen names at the time of integration. This would help you take the users to specific screens when a user clicks on the notification.

Enable Transaction APIs

You should integrate Transactional APIs to enable push for server events from your server. Read more about Transactional APIs in our docs here.

Enable Data APIs

In case you want to pass additional data about your users to MoEngage, you should get Server Server Communication integration implemented. Read more about Data APIs in our docs here.

Create a Notification centre in your app/website

To let your customer view the history of any promotions and notifications, it is recommended to get the notification Centre implemented, which acts as an inbox for all your notifications.

Configure your email connector

You must get your email connector integrated along with SMTP settings to enable you to send email campaigns

Implement Nudge in-app notification

Nudges are tiny embedded units which do not block the user’s flow. They have advanced segmentation capabilities and can be useful to show messages in a non-intrusive way to the users. Great for showing recommendations and announcements. You can use nudges only when App open is used as a Trigger condition for InApp campaigns.

You are now fully set up to access the MoEngage Dashboard to create powerful segments and target these segments with smart engagement campaigns."

Getting Started 
Integration
Reinstall Tracking

Many times, it is important for you to know the users who have reinstalled the app so that you can treat them separately in your user flows and other marketing segments and communications.

We have seen a lot of our users give out first-purchase discount coupons. Because of the inability to differentiate between Install and Reinstall, the onboarding / first purchase campaigns are sent to the same user after every reinstall by the user. To prevent this from happening, we now allow our users to track reinstalls for their users which makes their first purchase/activation campaigns more effective.

MoEngage tracks the reinstalls happening on your iOS and Android apps automatically.

Reinstall Tracking on iOS

MoEngage iOS SDK can detect when a reinstall happens on any specific device for a particular app basis two distinct anonymous ids that are saved locally on the device and changed when a reinstall happens. When a reinstall is detected, MoEngage iOS SDK will track an event - ""REINSTALL"" and this can be used to exclude users who reinstalled the app from your campaigns.

Reinstall Tracking on Android

Reinstalls on Android are detected differently than on iOS and may not be completely accurate. Nevertheless, we allow our users to track reinstalls for their android app users as well.

How do we track reinstalls on Android?

For tracking reinstalls on Android, we depend on Google Advertising Id, unique_id which is saved locally by the SDK, and push token (FCM token) which changes on every reinstall. By observing and detecting a change in the push token and unique_id saved by the SDK, we can predict if a user has reinstalled the app.

Please note that reinstalls can only be tracked for up to 60 days. Meaning, if a user reinstalls the app after 60 days of uninstalling, we would not be able to identify a reinstall.

Data Tracking for ReInstalls

Every time a reinstall is detected on Android or iOS, MoEngage will track the below data points automatically which you can use in your Segmentation / Analytics / Campaigns as required -

USER ATTRIBUTES

Device Reinstall: Every time a reinstall is detected, we save Device Reinstall: True in the user profile.
User Reinstall: Every time a reinstalled user logs into an already identified (existing user where ID exists) user in MoEngage, we save an attribute User Reinstall: True in the user profile.

User Attributes for reinstall are generally used in your Event Triggered Campaigns, Flows, and Analytics.

EVENTS
Device Reinstall: This event is tracked every time a reinstall is detected.
User Reinstall: This event is tracked when a reinstalled user logs into an already identified (existing user where ID exists) user in MoEngage who is marked as uninstalled (Install Status: False) and because of the login, the status user gets marked as installed (Install Status: True).

Events for reinstall are generally used in Segmentation and Analytics. 

Limitations

 1. If a user clears data on the device and push_id is also changed - In this case we will treat it as a case of “reinstall” instead of “data cleared on existing device”

2. If a user uninstalls the app resets Google Advertising Id and installs the app again, we will treat it as a new install.

3. If you have opted out of GAID tracking (Google Advertising Id), reinstall tracking will not work.

4. If the push token changes without the user uninstalling the app and the user logs out of the app at the same time, we may end up detecting this user as a reinstall."

Failed	Dialog was shown, but push permission is still not updated.	Inform the SDK whether the user granted/denied permission. For more information, refer to Notification Runtime Permissions.
Failed	User denied the push permission dialog; the dialog no longer shows up.	Redirect the user to the settings page to request permission manually. For more information, refer to Notification Runtime Permissions.
Test Push with App in Foreground

Test push with app in foreground helps you verify that push notifications are received and rendered properly when the app is open and in use. For example, ensure notifications do not disrupt user activity while displaying them subtly but noticeably.

To validate the push notification with the app in the foreground, perform the following steps:

Open the intended app in the foreground state.
Click Send test push on the dashboard.
There is a 60-second waiting period, where the MoEngage system verifies the action in the backend.
Click Confirm app in foreground to validate the step if the app was in the foreground when the notification was received. If not, click Reset to start validating again.
After the verification is completed, the status changes from Not Validated to Validated.
If there’s an error in the implementation, the status changes from Not Validated to Not Received. In that case, the following errors might have occurred.

Failed	Push notification not shown.	App created the notification but didn’t inform the SDK. For more information, refer to Push Display Handled by Application.
Test Push with App in Background

Test push with app in background helps verify that push notifications are delivered and displayed correctly when the app runs in the background. For example, test push with app in background ensures that the notification appears in the notification center with accurate content and icons.

To validate the push notification with the app in the foreground, perform the following steps:

Open the intended app in the background state.
Click Send test push on the dashboard.
There is a 60-second waiting period, where the MoEngage system verifies the action in the backend.
Click Confirm app in background to validate the step if the app was in the background when the notification was received. If not, click Reset to start validating again.
After the verification is completed, the status changes from Not Validated to Validated.
If there is any error in the implementation, the status changes from Not Validated to Not Received. In that case, the following errors might have occurred.
Test Push with the App in Background Validation Error Paths

MoEngage Integration Validation

MoEngage is a marketing automation and engagement platform that offers a wide variety of features and capabilities. In order to utilize the full potential of the MoEngage system, we need to Integrate it across our Website, Android, and iOS apps to enrich our user profiling and action tracking.

However, there can be numerous challenges in identifying whether the integration is done appropriately and meets the Goals and Objectives of the Integration. All key elements from the Successful Integration are available in the Integration Tracker."

Install/Uninstall/Reinstall Integration Validation

This help article covers specific User Actions Testing related information like Install/Update/Uninstall/Reinstall across Android and iOS platforms.

What do we want to validate?

Ensuring that Install, Update, Uninstall, and Reinstall are tracked properly. INSTALL and UPDATE events aren't automatically tracked by our SDKs. Depending on the SDK integration, you will have to pass this information to our SDK.

How to validate?

First, we should get the app build for Android/iOS after it is integrated with MoEngage SDK. 

Once we install the app build on our device and then open the app, it should track the INSTALL event in the user profile.

 
In case you have a newer version available and you install that app builds on top of the existing app on the device, it should track the UPDATE event in the user profile.

In case you remove the app from the device or uninstall it, it should track UNINSTALL(via silent push or sending/testing push campaign). For more details, please refer to this Uninstall tracking.

After you have uninstalled the app and installed it again on the same device, it should track the REINSTALL event in the user profile.


 

Success Criteria

We should be able to track INSTALL, UPDATE, UNINSTALL, and REINSTALL correctly on the user profile as an event as it decides the reachability of the user via push.

If the user has still the app installed then the Install status of the user attribute will be true.
Potential Issues and Solutions

If Install/Update is not correctly tracked, we will not be able to create campaigns to target users on install to register drop use cases, updating apps from one version to another. To fix the INSTALL/UPDATE issue, please check Android and iOS as per the platform.

If Uninstall tracking is not implemented correctly, this can lead to issues in push delivery like more stale users in the system but not reachable. To fix UNINSTALL tracking issue, please check this link."

User Attribute/Profile Integration Validation

This help article covers User Profile Testing for Login/Logout/User Attributes-related information across Android, iOS, and website platforms.


What do we want to Validate?

Ensuring that Login ID, Email, Phone, and any other User Attributes are tracked correctly

How to validate?
First, we should get the app build for Android/iOS or Website after it is integrated with MoEngage SDK. 
Once we install the app built on our device or open the website, we should log in with personal information like Email Address, Phone Number, Social Login, and so on according to the app/website design.
After your login is successful, the App/Website should capture data and your user profile will be created on MoEngage Dashboard.
After successful login, we can search on the MoEngage segmentation dashboard using the Email, Phone, or ID as tracked by the app/website as below and if the user is created, the result will display the count as 1. User profiles can be seen by clicking on the person icon inside the Sample Users section as shown below.

 

We should be verifying ID, Email, Phone and other User Attributes are correctly mapped on the MoEngage dashboard as described. Few user attributes are tracked by MoEngage SDK as standard user attributes and they are shown under Tracked Standard Attribute.

 

If any custom user attributes are tracked, these can be found as described. In addition to standard user attributes which are not tracked by MoEngage SDK, these are shown under Tracked Custom Attribute.


Success Criteria
ID is one of the most important data points in the MoEngage system. For any user, tracking user attributes are important but ID is compulsory for any registered users. If ID is not specified for a user as unique then further user merging and profile management across Android, iOS, Web or any analytics system tracking will not be synchronized to a single profile. If the Login ID is set correctly on the login of the app/website, the user profile will display as described. Similarly, all other user attributes should be tracked. To fix Login ID-related or user attributes issues, refer to Android, iOS, and Web.

 

If the app has a Logout feature and it is implemented correctly then click the Logout button, it is tracked successfully and should display as described along with platform names like Android, iOS, or web. To fix the log-out issue, refer to Android, iOS, and Web.



Potential Issues and Solutions

If the Login ID is not correctly set while logging in to the app/website, it can lead to corrupted user data.
To fix the Login ID-related issue, refer to Android, iOS, and Web.

If Login ID, Email, Phone, or any other user attributes are not correctly tracked in the user profile it can lead to data corruption for Push, SMS, and Email Channel communication along with performance statistics can be problematic. To fix User attributes-related issues, refer to Android, iOS, and Web.

If User Logout is not tracked at the time of user logging out then data can be corrupted. To fix the Logout issue, refer to Android, iOS, and Web."

Check for all the attributes that need to be passed with the event
Event Source has to be SDK, Platform has to be the type of device where the event is performed and type has to be tracked user events.


Check the attribute data types
String data type attributes should have string-related operators like is, contains, starts with, etc
Date attributes should have operators like on, in between, before after, etc
Number attributes should have operators like equal to, greater than, in between, etc
Potential Issues and Solutions

Unique Event Name - It is most important to track unique names for events across platforms.

Event attributes Data Type - It is also important to maintain datatype consistent across platforms.

Without the proper event tracking the user behavior cannot be identified, and automated campaigns cannot be created. To fix events-related issues, refer to Android, iOS, and Web docs."

Early Access

This is an Early Access feature. To enable it for your account, contact your CSM or raise a support ticket.

Overview

API keys are typically used as an authentication or authorization mechanism. They are unique identifiers associated with a user or an application with access to API resources.

The API keys serve as a way for the API provider to track and control access to their resources. They help ensure the security and accountability of API access and allow providers to manage and monitor usage effectively.

info	

Information

The multikey feature is currently supported by data, segmentation, and push APIs. 

To send data to MoEngage, you can use the Workspace ID and API key for that particular data. The API key used for sending user data differs from the API key used for sending events. Whenever a key is regenerated, the old key expires immediately, and it takes some time for the new key to become functional, leading to possible downtimes. As a solution, MoEngage provides multiple API keys, which help you to:

Generate a new key while the existing key is still available: With the multi-key support, the existing key can be used until the new key becomes functional. This helps you rotate your keys for security purposes and avoid downtime. Consider a scenario in which your internal team creates a new key, and it takes some time for the team to integrate it into the system. Because the old key is still functional, your team has the time to integrate the new key into the system. After integrating the new key, you can deprecate the old key. This avoids downtime when sending data to MoEngage.
Use different keys for different teams: Consider a scenario where an enterprise customer works with various vendors. This enterprise customer can share a key with one of its vendors to fulfill a business use case, which restricts the other vendors from fulfilling the same use case for security reasons. Using this feature, all vendors can fulfill the same use case by accessing it using different keys. Furthermore, as an enterprise customer, you can use different keys for different internal teams based on their functionalities.
Create a Key
info	

Information

After the multi-API key feature is enabled, the existing API keys in the API dashboard are migrated to your new API key dashboard as legacy keys.
You can view the legacy key details and continue to use them. But you cannot archive, edit, or regenerate them.
MoEngage recommends creating and utilizing new keys because legacy keys will be deprecated in the future.

Perform the following steps to create a key:

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, go to Settings > Account > API keys.
Click + Create new key.

In the Create new key page, enter the following details:
In the Key name box, type a name for your key to facilitate easy identification.
In the Select APIs for access check box list, select the APIs you want to access using this key.

Click Save. After saving, this key is listed under Active API keys.

Click this option to regenerate a new key.

 

Note: The old key expires immediately after regenerating. To avoid errors, replace the old key with the regenerated key.


Edit key details	Click this option to edit the key name or access to your APIs.
Archive key	

Click this option to archive your keys. After archiving them once, you cannot unarchive keys.

 

Note: A maximum of 10 archived keys is maintained under the archived key list.

Audit Logs

Admins use audit logs to understand the various actions performed in the MoEngage dashboard. Similarly, the audit logs also list any actions related to API keys. This helps admins know who performed what actions related to API keys. The following actions are supported in Audit logs:

Access Roles
Overview 

MoEngage offers role-based access control for account admins to enable different levels of access permissions (to dashboard components) for your team members.

You can view the access roles by navigating to Settings > Account > Team management > Roles.

Types of Access Roles

We provide the following two types of access roles:

Default Roles

These are the default roles with fixed permissions and are available for every account. These roles cannot be edited. MoEngage provides the following default roles:

Admin

The person who creates the workspace is assigned the Admin role by default. The role has all permissions for the account

Creating campaigns

Changing account settings

Inviting team members

Admins are allowed to invite other users as Admin or Manager or Marketer and so on. Only admins are allowed to create or edit or delete new Teams.

For more information about team management, refer to Teams in MoEngage.

Manager

The person who will run marketing campaigns for live users, and manage the account and all settings. This member has all permissions on the dashboard similar to Admin, barring the permission to Create/Edit/Delete Teams. There can be multiple managers in one account. Managers can invite team members to roles of Manager and below.

Marketer

The person who will create the campaigns for live users has access to segmentation but cannot access billing info. With Campaign approval flow, a marketer's campaigns will go live ONLY upon approval from the Manage or Admin. For more information, refer to Campaign Approval Flow.

Developer

The person who will integrate your app/web with MoEngage. This member can access/test all features in the TEST environment but has restricted access in the LIVE environment. The access details are as follows:

Can not view Billing details and can only add Developers to the account
Can not view campaigns created by Admin/Manager team members
Can not change Push FC and DND settings
Analyst

The person who has access to view/export campaign data, user segmentation data, and set up daily reports. This member can not create any campaigns or change any settings (except setting up Reports). 

To summarize, the following are the default roles and their access permissions.

Team Management
Teams in MoEngage

MoEngage supports the management of multiple teams for a workspace. A team is a group of MoEngage users using the MoEngage dashboard and collaborating on the same campaigns. You can create teams out of users from the same geography or from the same vertical within the enterprise. You can define the end user/audience scope for your team by defining the users who can be targeted for campaigns run by them.

Create a New Team

Users with access to the Create and Manage permission under the permission set ""Teams"" can create, edit, and delete a team.

To add a new team:

Navigate to Settings -> Account -> Team management -> Teams.
Click  + Create Team. The Create Team screen is displayed.

Enter the following fields:
Field	Description
Team Name	Specify a unique name for your team.
Description	Add details about the purpose of the team.
Click Create. You get a success message upon successful creation, as shown in the following image. 

The newly created team is available at the end in the left menu on the Teams page.
info	

Note

You can create teams in both Test and Live environments by switching between the environments.
The number of teams a user is allowed to create for a workspace on MoEngage is not restricted.
The Team Management capability is disabled by default. When the option is enabled, all the existing campaigns and users become part of one team with the same name as the workspace.
You can add other teams later on to the workspace. The default team cannot be deleted or edited.
Any newly created team automatically includes all the admins.
Edit a Team

You can edit the name and description of a team. To edit a team:

Navigate to Settings -> Account -> Team management -> Teams.

Add Users to a Team

Existing team members with access to the “Create and Manage” permission under the permission set ""Teams"" can invite users to a team.

Users can be part of multiple teams but will have permissions for the same role across all the teams that they are part of. Each team can have users with all the possible roles. For more information about different access roles, refer to Different Access Roles.

To add a user,

Navigate to Settings -> Account -> Team management -> Teams.
Select the relevant team from the left navigation menu to which you want to add the user.

Team View

Users who are part of multiple teams can switch between them using the Teams drop-down list in the team management section of the dashboard. The team view lists the members of that team only.

Edit a User Role

Team members can edit the roles of other team members based on the role hierarchy. A user with the same or superior role as theirs can change each user's role.

Team Access Management

Each user's access to the team can be removed by a user with the same or superior role to theirs. When removed, the user will lose access to that team's dashboard but will continue to have access to other teams' dashboards. If the user is part of only one team, they will lose access to the workspace altogether.

This is in addition to the option of revoking a user's access to the workspace, which will cause the user to lose access to all the teams he is part of for that workspace.

Campaign Creation and Campaign Visibility for Team Members
Campaign Creation

Every team member can create campaigns only for the teams they are part of. Team members who are part of multiple teams must select the team they want to create the campaign for as the mandatory first step in the campaign creation process. The team selection step is as follows:

Change the Team Name in a Published Campaign

If you change the team while editing a published campaign:

If the team name is edited before the start time of the campaign, you are notified that the segmentation and reachability will be recalculated based on the newly selected team (the new team's segmentation filters apply to the campaign's target audience now), as shown in the following image.
If the campaign sending is in progress, you cannot edit the team. You can only edit the team for a campaign before the Scheduled and Active campaigns start.
Campaign Visibility

Team members can only see the campaigns created for their team, either by themselves or by other team members.

Team members who are part of multiple teams or admins who are part of all teams see campaigns from all teams they are part of on the All campaigns page on the dashboard. Team members can choose to filter the campaigns using the team from the All campaigns for drop-down list available at the top of the page, as depicted in the image below. The same applies to campaign drafts as well.

Teams 2.0 in MoEngage
info	

Information

Teams 2.0 is an add-on feature. Contact your MoEngage CSM (customer success manager) or the Support team to enable it for your account.

Overview

Teams can be set up across your customers based on location, language, and custom attributes. This allows you to view and access campaigns and customer databases specific to the customers you are handling. Teams in MoEngage support team selection and team-based filters for segmentation and campaigns.

For example, businesses operating in multiple countries often require their marketers to have access to data and audiences specific to their respective countries and brands. Teams in MoEngage provide marketers with this particular access, ensuring that customers of a particular brand from a country are not mistakenly targeted with promotions intended for another country.

Create a New Team

Users with access to the Create and Manage permission under the permission set Teams can create, edit, and delete a team. Perform the following steps to create a new team:

Navigate to Settings > Account > Team management > Teams.
Click  + Create Team. The Create Team screen is displayed.

Enter the following details:
Field	Description
Team Name	Specify a unique name for your team.
Description	Add details about the purpose of the team.
Define the targeting criteria for the team 
	

In the select attribute drop-down list, select the user attribute to filter the users to be targeted by the team being created.

 

For example, if your team runs campaigns targeted at users in a specific city, such as New York, you can add the filter condition, as in the following image:

 

Click Create. You get a success message upon successful creation, as shown in the following image. 

The newly created team is available at the end in the left menu on the Teams page.
Edit a Team

You can edit the name and description of a team. To edit a team:

Navigate to Settings -> Account -> Team management -> Teams.
Select the relevant team from the left navigation menu that you want to edit.
Click on the vertical ellipsis icon beside Description.

Click Edit team. The Edit team page is displayed.
You can edit the Team Name, Description, and targeting criteria.
Click Save. You will be prompted for confirmation.



 

Note that editing a team's targeting criteria impacts active campaigns in their next run. For example, your current target segment for the team is users in two countries, France and Belgium. If you remove users in Belgium from this target user set by editing the segment criteria, the user base targeted in the next run of your active campaigns will be impacted (only users in France will be targeted for the campaigns run by the team).
Remove a Team

Follow the steps below to remove a team:

Navigate to Settings > Account > Team management > Teams.
Select the relevant team from the left navigation menu that you want to delete.
Click on the vertical ellipsis icon beside Description.
Click Delete team. You are prompted for confirmation and notified of the following:
When you delete a team, its campaigns and custom segments are moved to the default team.
The team members of your team will be moved to the default team.
All campaigns in the active state for your current team will be paused.
A list of active campaigns for the team is listed. You can download this list as a CSV file by clicking Download. You can click the individual hyperlinks for each of the active campaigns to see the campaign's analytics and info.

Click Delete to delete the team.
Team Select and Filter with Segments
Create Segments with a Team-Based Filter

After creating Teams, follow the below steps to create segments based on the teams you created.

Log in to the MoEngage dashboard.
Navigate to Segments > Create Segments.
You can select the teams you are a member of from the Create segment for drop-down list at the top. When selected, the team-based filter is applied to the segment you are creating. The team name can be any.
For example, in the image below, the Team Test brand is selected, and the targeting criteria for the Test-brand team are automatically applied to the segment. This creates a segment targeted to Test-brand, which also fulfills the Filter users by condition.
If you select All users, the segment targets users in the selected Team.

Proceed to the next steps of creating the segment. For more information, refer to Create Segments.

Campaign Approval Workflow

Campaign approval allows marketing teams to control/review the campaigns that are going live by putting in place a creator-approver (maker-checker) approach. Marketing teams can decide which users are allowed to create the campaigns and which users have the privilege to approve them.

Enable Campaign Approval Workflow for Campaigns
info	

Information

Only Admins or managers can enable the Campaign Approval Flow.

Navigate to MoEngage Dashboard > Settings >  Account > Team management. The Team management page is displayed.
On the Members tab, turn the Approval Flow toggle on to enable the campaign approval flow. The toggle is disabled by default.

Assign Roles
Approver Role

All the Managers and Admins will have approver rights when the Approval Flow toggle is turned on.

Marketer Role

Campaigns created by Marketers must be sent for approval.

Because the Marketer role is new, you need to add users to the Marketer role or change roles for existing users.

Send a Campaign for Approval

After the Approval Flow toggle is turned on, marketers can create a campaign and send it to a list of approvers.

Approved/Rejected

When the marketer clicks Send For Approval, all the assigned approvers will get the email for reviewing the campaign. Approvers can click the campaign link in the email and they will get redirected to the specified campaign.

Now, they can review the campaign and choose to reject or approve it before the campaign sent time is passed.

If approved, the campaign will become Live.
If rejected, the marketers can edit the campaigns as per the Approver's comments and send them again for approval.

Admins/Managers can also choose to edit the campaigns Under Review and make them Live with all the necessary changes.

info	

Note

Marketers cannot edit the campaigns when campaigns are Under Review.
Only the approvers who were asked to review the campaigns can Approve/Reject them.
Admin/Managers cannot edit the Rejected campaigns.
The campaign Approval workflow is supported for Push, Email, SMS, WhatsApp, In-app, On-site Messaging, Facebook Audience, and Connector campaigns.
The campaign Approval workflow is not supported for Cards, Flows, and Web personalization campaigns."

2-Step Verification or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Overview

2-step verification or two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires two different verification steps to access an account or system, rather than just a password. This adds an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. 2FA requires the user to prove their identity in two separate ways, often combining ""something they know"" (like a password) with ""something they have"" (like a phone).

Advantages of 2-Step Verification

2-step verification provides you with the following advantages:

Enhanced security: 2-step verification significantly strengthens account security, making it significantly harder for hackers to gain unauthorized access, even if they somehow obtain a password.
Reduced risk of fraud and data breaches: By requiring a second factor, 2-step verification helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information, reducing the risk of fraud and data breaches.
Compliance with regulations: Many industries and regulations now mandate 2-step verification to protect sensitive data, ensuring businesses meet compliance requirements like those for cybersecurity insurance and financial institutions.
Increased customer trust: Implementing 2-step verification demonstrates a commitment to security, building customer trust and confidence in the organization's ability to protect their information.
Reduced password fatigue: 2-step verification can help alleviate password fatigue by allowing users to use simpler, easier-to-remember passwords without compromising security.
2-Step Verification Implementation in MoEngage

MoEngage allows you to secure your MoEngage account (workspace) with 2-step verification. You can control users' access to your workspace with the following two factors:

Email ID and password.
Verification code (generated by the authentication app on the device). MoEngage supports 2-step verification through apps such as Google Authenticator, Twilio Authy, etc.

You can implement 2-step verification at:

Workspace level: Administrators can manage 2-step verification for all users within a workspace.

info	

Information

 

When an Admin creates a new workspace, MoEngage enables 2-step verification by default. They can enable and disable it for all team members' accounts in that workspace.

User level: If the Admin has not enabled 2-step verification for all users at the workspace level, all users can manage 2-step verification for their respective accounts in My profile. For more information, refer to Manage Your Profile.

FAQ
Why is my access to the MoEngage dashboard denied?


MoEngage access may be restricted to specific IP addresses configured by your administrator.

 

For example, the IP address of your office VPN is whitelisted, whereas the network to which your personal device is connected to may not be. When you try to access the MoEngage dashboard from outside the office VPN, MoEngage will deny you access. In that case, you need to connect to your office VPN and access the MoEngage dashboard.

 

If you cannot access the MoEngage dashboard, contact your MoEngage administrator to verify that you are using a whitelisted IP address. To check your current IP address, use a website such as What is My IP Address."

Security
Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO) is a system that allows you to use one set of login credentials to access multiple applications without having to re-enter their credentials for each individual application. With SSO, you can easily access the MoEngage dashboard using your organization's central identity provider (IdP).

Advantages of SSO

The advantages of using SSO include:

Simplified user experience: SSO eliminates the need for users to remember and manage multiple usernames and passwords for different applications, making the login process much easier and faster.
Reduced password fatigue: By consolidating credentials, SSO reduces the burden on users to remember and manage numerous passwords, which can lead to security risks and frustration.
Enhanced security: Centralized authentication with SSO allows for more effective security controls, such as stronger password policies and multi-factor authentication, and simplifies the process of managing user access and permissions.
Improved productivity: SSO allows users to spend less time on login processes and more time on core work tasks, leading to increased productivity and efficiency.
Reduced IT costs: SSO streamlines user access management, reducing the workload for IT teams and minimizing the need for password resets and support calls, leading to cost savings.
SSO Configuration

MoEngage supports SSO using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 and acts as an SSO service provider (SP). SAML is an industry-standard protocol that enables user authentication delegation similar to OAuth 2.

Upon login, you are redirected to your internal or external SSO system for authentication and then returned to MoEngage when the response is verified.

info	

Information

Contact your organization's IT team to set up SSO to log in to the MoEngage dashboard.
Only administrators can enable SSO for a workspace, which allows their teammates to log in securely using the identity provider credentials.
To configure SSO, you need an Admin role with the Setup & manage permission for the Login Settings component.
Identity Providers (IdPs)

MoEngage uses Identity Providers (IdPs) to simplify and centralize user login. This allows you to securely access MoEngage services using SSO based on the SAML 2.0 standard. MoEngage supports the following IdPs currently:

Okta
Onelogin
Azure (Microsoft Entra ID)
Google Admin

Other (you can configure other IdPs, provided they are SAML 2.0 compliant)

IP Whitelisting in MoEngage
Overview

IP whitelisting (IP allowlisting) is a security practice that allows organizations to restrict access to their networks, systems, and resources to predefined IP addresses, blocking all others. This cybersecurity mechanism helps businesses prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data. Businesses can use IP whitelisting to control access to their tools, software, applications, websites, and critical resources.

This document outlines the relevance of IP whitelisting and how marketers and developers can use it effectively.

Key Advantages of IP Whitelisting

The following are the advantages of IP whitelisting:

Enhanced security: By permitting connections only from known, trusted IP addresses, whitelisting effectively blocks potential threats from unknown sources, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and malware attacks. Overall, it adds an extra layer of security to protect sensitive data.
Proactive defense: Unlike blacklisting, which relies on identifying and blocking known threats, whitelisting takes a proactive approach by allowing only approved access, making it more effective against emerging threats.
Reduced false positives: Because whitelisting blocks connections only from unapproved sources, the chances of accidentally blocking legitimate users are minimized, reducing frustration and disruption.
Improved network visibility: By actively managing the list of allowed IP addresses, organizations gain better insight into who is accessing the network and can easily identify suspicious activity.
Whitelist MoEngage IPs

MoEngage sends/receives data to/from the servers of customers or partners. With IP whitelisting, you can verify that requests are actually coming from MoEngage, adding an additional layer of security.

MoEngage is a multi-tenant SaaS vendor, so our services change IPs frequently for scale and security. We may need to send data from a different server when circumstances demand it to ensure our services are operational and customers are not impacted. MoEngage may use one or all of the IPs listed in this document while sending/receiving data to/from the servers of customers or partners.

Campaign Sending

MoEngage uses dynamic IPs. But if you need MoEngage to access your service via static IPs, you must whitelist MoEngage IPs on your side. To enable static IPs for a messaging channel, contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) or submit a support ticket to request enablement of Send via Static IPs for <Messaging Channel>. After static IPs for a messaging channel are enabled, you can whitelist the relevant MoEngage IPs based on the data center where your workspace is located. For more information on MoEngage Data Centers, refer here.

Here are the IPs that you can whitelist to ensure that only allowed IPs send messages:

Security Best Practices

As an administrator, you want to ensure MoEngage account security. Here are some recommendations for you when you create an account with MoEngage:

Strong Authentication Practices
Enable a Two Factor Authentication (2FA) system for all MoEngage account users, without exception. This helps you to restrict suspicious login attempts by verifying the identity of the user and making sure that access to the platform is secure. For more information, refer to, 2 Step Verification.

Enable Single Sign-On (SSO) access to the MoEngage platform, organization-wide. For more information, refer to Single Sign-On (SSO).
info	

Information

You might need help from your IT support team to set up SSO. MoEngage supports SSO using SAML 2.0 and acts as a service provider (SP) for SSO.

Granular Access Controls
MoEngage allows you provide customized access, permissions, and privileges for different team members. This helps in restricting every team member from having access to the complete dashboard/database and provides you more control over the information/data distribution.

MoEngage allows you  to implement Campaign Approval Workflows to have better control over the campaigns that are going live. This can help ensure a more secure campaign workflow and avoid breaches in quality and policies.
Network Restriction

You can enable IP Whitelisting in your SaaS application account to ensure user authentication from whitelisted IP only.

You can whitelist your VPN IP to ensure MoEngage SaaS application access is enabled using a trusted network of your choice.
If your organization currently does not use a VPN solution, consider adopting Open Source options such as OpenVPN, Pritunl.
The IP Whitelisting feature on the MoEngage platform/SaaS application is available only to organizations using an Enterprise license. Please contact your MoEngage Customer Success Account Manager for more details. 
Regular User Access Audits
Audit the access of all MoEngage account users at least once every 2 weeks.
Revoke the access of all unused, unwanted, or off-boarded users.
Audit the access, permissions, and privileges of all users from time to time. If they are not required, change their roles to a lower permission level wherever possible.
Keep users with  “Admin” and “Manager” roles to a minimum. We recommend you keep only one admin role for each account.

Warning

MoEngage automatically logs you out of your session if your account does not have any activity for one day. To customize the time of your session, Raise a Support Ticket Through MoEngage Dashboard.

Suspicious Login Verification
Overview

Logging in from a new location or a new device requires further authentication using an OTP sent to your email address. MoEngage sends an OTP to your registered email whenever it detects a new device/new location for your ID. This is more beneficial than only using login credentials, as 

An additional layer of authentication increases security.
The risk, in case of compromised credentials, is reduced.
Log In

Once you enter your login credentials on the login page, MoEngage detects either your device or location as unrecognized and takes you to a new page where the system asks you for an OTP.


Enter the OTP received on your registered email address.
Click Verify.
info	

Note

If you don't see the mail in your inbox, you can search for an email with the subject line MoEngage login OTP.
The OTP is valid for 3 minutes only. After 3 minutes, your OTP will expire, and you will have to re-enter your credentials.

You should now be directed to your MoEngage account. If you still have any issues, contact the MoEngage Support team.

To contact the MoEngage Support team, you can raise a ticket through the Support Web Form within the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer here."

Issue: An error occurs on the 2 Factor Authentication screen during login
Scenario

After entering the email and password, the user is redirected to the 2 Factor Authentication screen and then to the login screen with the error “OTP Expired, please login again. “

Explanation

If there is a difference between the local system time and the current time, the code verifies the user's current local system time for OTP verification. So, the user gets the error for OTP expiration.

Resolution Steps
Ask the user to check the current local system time and verify it with the current time on this website: https://greenwichmeantime.com/current-time/
If the times differ, ask the user to change their system time.

Enable User Merging

User merging in MoEngage Analytics consolidates activity across different devices or sessions (anonymous vs. logged-in) under a single, unified user profile specifically for analytics reporting. This ensures more accurate user counts and Behavior Analysis within MoEngage Analytics.

MoEngage enables you to have a single user ID for each of your users, even if they are using different devices. When a user visits your website or app, MoEngage merges the anonymous user profile with the registered user profile after they log in to the system. For more information on user merging, refer to User Merging.

Perform the following steps to enable user merging:

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, go to Settings > Analytics > User merging.
On the User merging page, turn the Analytics user merging toggle on.

info	

Information

Segmentation features in MoEngage have their own user merging logic. If Analytics user merging is disabled, you might observe discrepancies in user counts between Segmentation queries and Analytics reports for the same criteria. This is because Analytics will treat anonymous and logged-in sessions as separate users. Enabling the Analytics user merging toggle helps align these counts by applying merging logic within MoEngage Analytics."

Click the ellipsis icon to Edit an attribute or event, Turn visibility off, or Block.

Blocking due to Limits of data tracking

At times, if your events, event attributes, or user attributes breach the limits mentioned here or as shown in your overview tab, then your new events, event attributes, or user attributes may be automatically blocked.

Visibility

The Visibility option helps you hide or unhide events, event attributes, and user attributes from your drop-downs. By default, visibility is on for all events, event attributes, or user attributes ingested into the MoEngage system.

Your drop-downs may become cluttered over time due to too many events and event attributes, even the ones your marketers don't need. In such cases, hiding ensures that such events and event attributes no longer appear in the drop-down.
Perform the following steps to turn off the visibility of your events, events attributes, or user attributes:

Select the event, event attribute, or user attribute you want to turn off the visibility.
Click Visibility Off.

In the following dialog box that appears, click Update.

After turning it off, the Visibility changes from On to Off.

Perform the following steps to turn on the visibility of your events, events attributes, or user attributes:

Select the event, event attribute, or user attribute you want to turn on the visibility.
Click Visibility On.

In the following dialog box that appears, click Update.

After turning it on, the Visibility changes from Off to On.
Edit Display Name

Display name will enable your marketers to read your event, event attribute, and user attribute names clearly while creating segments.

At times, when your analytics systems are generating events, they may be encoded and are not easily readable by marketers. In such cases, you can always define a display name for your events and make it easy for your marketers.

Perform the following steps to set the display name for event attribute or user attribute.

Click the ellipsis icon against event attribute, or user attribute. 
Click Edit attribute.  
In the Edit attribute details side drawer, type the Display name.

Click Save.



Perform the following steps to set the display name for event.

Click the ellipsis icon against event. 
Click Edit event.  


In the Edit event  side drawer, type the Display name.

Click Save.


Edit description

The description will give additional context to your marketers on what an event does. You can set this from the edit event/edit event attribute/edit user attribute pop-up, similar to what is shown in the edit display name action.

Set Allowed Data types

Setting up allowed data type action is supported for user attributes and event attributes and this ensures that any other data type is not recorded for the same attribute.

Perform the following steps to set allowed data types for event attributes or user attributes:

Click the ellipsis icon against event attribute, or user attribute. 
Click Edit attribute.  
In the Edit attribute details side drawer, select the data type from the Allowed data type list.

Click Save.
How does this work?

For example, if you set the allowed data types of an attribute called ""amount"" as Numeric, then after this point, whenever the ""amount"" attribute is tracked, MoEngage will try to typecast the value to Numeric. For example, after setting allowed data types of amount as Numeric, if you send {""amount"": ""145""}, which is a string value, we will save it as 145 numeric and enable you to run numeric operators on this value in Segmentation and Analytics. However, if you send {""amount"": ""sample value""}, we will not be able to typecast this value, and hence it will be dropped. We will not save the amount: sample_value in your database to ensure accurate data is only saved.

The below table lists the data type of incoming attributes on columns and the allowed data type on rows and the value of each cell represents the data ingestion logic.

 	String	Numeric	Boolean	Date	Location
Any	Accepted as String	Accepted as Numeric	Accepted as Boolean	Accepted as Date	Accepted as Location
String	Accepted as String	Typecast to String	Typecast to String	Typecast to String	Typecast to String
Numeric	Typecast to Numeric if possible else drop	Accepted as Numeric	Dropped	Dropped	Dropped
Boolean	Typecast to boolean if possible else drop	Dropped	Dropped	Dropped	Dropped
Date	Typecast to Date for accepted formats else drop	Dropped	Dropped	Dropped	Dropped
Location	Typecast to Location for accepted format else drop	Dropped	Dropped	Dropped	Dropped

By default, attributes will be set to Any which means that any data type will be accepted for this attribute. If more than one data type is set for an attribute then your segmentation drop-down will show multiple data types during query creation as shown below.

Once you set the allowed data type, only the allowed data type will be ingested going forward. However, we may still see older data types in your database due to past data present in the system. By default, the allowed data type will be pre-selected for your segmentation.

Array Typecasting

All the elements in the array have to be homogenous, which means they must be either integers or strings. If they are not homogenous, MoEngage tries to typecast (transform) the element and then store the data. Following is the example of an array in a CSV field: [1|2|3]

If an array has elements [“1” | 2 | “abc”] of multiple datatypes and the defined datatype is Array Integer, then the final array ingested in MoEngage is [ 1, 2 ]. In this case, “abc” was a string that could not be transformed into an integer and hence not ingested into MoEngage in the final array."

Information

Data Management Alerts feature is only available if you have Alert Management enabled for your workspace.
Note that only roles with permission to create custom alerts can view and edit alerts. For more information, refer to Access Roles.
Overview

Data management alerts are notifications or warnings triggered by certain conditions related to the usage or volume of events and user attributes in the data management dashboard of your MoEngage workspace. As a marketer, you can use these alerts to monitor and manage your data effectively, ensuring its quality, integrity, security, and compliance.

The following are the use cases that can be fulfilled using data management alerts:

Monitor the event and user attribute usage proactively, thereby complying with your workspace's Data Tracking Policies. When you set up usage alerts, you are notified based on your event and user attribute usage.
Validate the configuration of your data integration with MoEngage. Incorrect configuration of the data integration results in unnecessary event data flow to MoEngage. Setting up event volume alerts lets you know if such a flow occurs. 

You can access this feature from Settings > Analytics and Data > Data Management.

Create a Usage Alert

This option allows you to create alerts based on the usage of data. You can create alerts for event usage and user attribute usage. Perform the following steps to create an event usage alert:

Campaign Audience Limit
Overview

In marketing, controlling campaign reach and expenditure is crucial for effective resource allocation and achieving specific business goals. The Campaign audience limit feature in MoEngage empowers you with this control by allowing you to cap the number of users who receive a campaign based on key engagement metrics such as Sent, Impressions, Open, Delivered, and Conversions. This functionality directly addresses the need to manage promotional offers, limit redemptions, and gate access to exclusive content for a defined audience size, ensuring optimal budget utilization.

Furthermore, for recurring campaigns targeting large user segments, the Campaign audience limit enables you to manage the maximum number of users engaged per instance (particularly with the daily and instance-level options), contributing to broader reach over time, even though the system randomly selects users for each instance and some overlap may occur.

 	

Early Access

This is an Early Access feature. To enable it for your account, contact your CSM or raise a support ticket.

Use Case

Are you looking to stay within your campaign budget cap? The Campaign audience limit feature is just what you need. By setting a specific threshold for the number of users who will receive your campaign, you can ensure that your budget remains intact and avoid exceeding your spending limits. Once the designated number of users has been reached, the campaign will automatically pause, preventing budget breaches.

Configure Campaign Audience Limit

The Campaign audience limit option is available in the Target Users step while creating a campaign. You can turn on the toggle to trigger the user limit based on the configuration. 

This feature allows you to set the following campaign audience limits based on the delivery types:

Total

The campaign will be paused when the events (Sent, Impressions, Open, Delivered, Conversions) have reached the desired limit.

Daily

The campaign will be paused when the day's events (Sent, Impressions, Open, Delivered, Conversions) reach the desired limit for that day.

Instance

The campaign will be paused when the events (Sent, Impressions, Open, Delivered, Conversions) from the specific instance have reached the desired limit.

The following table displays the campaign audience limits supported for channels based on campaign delivery types:

Frequency capping
Overview

Frequency capping (FC) lets you control your campaign's communication frequency with users. This significantly prevents customers from receiving bursts of communication from multiple channels simultaneously and improves user engagement and brand value in the market.

You can configure Frequency capping in two ways,

Channel and Campaign Delivery: You can configure frequency capping for your campaign's communication based on delivery types, such as one-time, event-triggered, etc., from any channel.
Tag-based Frequency capping: You can configure frequency capping for your campaign's communication with tags such as promotional, engagement, etc., which allows you to control the communication of your campaigns that have the tags you selected.
info	

Note

The Tag-based FC is a new feature. To enable it for your account, contact your CSM or raise a support ticket.

Configure Frequency Capping

You can configure FC for multiple channels and delivery types.

info	

Information

The frequency capping you configure applies only to the upcoming campaigns and does not affect existing ones.

Log in to the MoEngage dashboard.
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, select Settings > Channels.
In the Channels section, select Delivery controls.
On the Delivery controls page, click the Frequency capping tab.
Set the frequency capping value, which can be configured globally for all channels in cross channel configuration and individually in the channel specific configuration section.
Cross-channel configuration: Turn on the All channels toggle and specify the limit for the number of communications that must be sent to users from all channels. This is the maximum limit for the total number of communications that must be sent to a customer within the specified number of days. For example, if you set the cap at four communications in 6 days, you can send only four communications in total from all the channels in the next 6 days. This is performed on a first-come, first-served basis. 
 
Delivery and Channel specific configuration: Turn on the individual channel level toggles and specify the limits of your communication for each channel. You must configure the total number of communications that can be sent for each channel and select the delivery type of the campaigns, such as one time/periodic, event triggered, etc., from which the communication must be sent. 
Tag-based configuration: Turn on the individual channel level toggles and specify the communication limits for each channel. Tag-based frequency capping can be configured using the following options. After selecting any of the following options, you are provided another field to select the tags.

Campaigns with all the selected tags: This option allows you to limit the communication from campaigns associated with all the tags you select. In the following example, we have configured FC for Push notifications from the campaigns with all the selected tags (Tags: promotional and transactional).
Campaigns with any of the selected tags: This option allows you to limit the communication from the campaigns associated with any of the selected tags. In the following example, we have configured FC for SMS & RCS from the campaigns with all the selected tags (Tags: promotional, transactional, incentive).
info	

Note

Tag-based frequency capping also applies to Flows. If you choose campaigns with all or any of the selected tags while configuring FC, this includes the campaigns that are part of Flows. 

Configure FC in Outbound Channels

You can configure FC in the following outbound channels:

Push
SMS & RCS
Email
WhatsApp
Connector

To enable Frequency capping for the Push notifications:

Turn on the Push toggle.
Enter the maximum number of communications you wish to send over a specified number of days (for example, two push notifications in one day). This configuration applies to all Push campaigns by default. For example, if the FC for Push is set as six communications for the next 6 days, a maximum of six communications are sent in the next 6 days. This is done on a first-come, first-served basis.
To set FC based on the campaign's delivery type, add a rule below by clicking the plus sign (+) at the end of each configuration and configure the delivery type to one time/periodic, event triggered, etc.
You can configure FC based on tags by adding another rule with the option, select from campaigns with any/all of the selected tags and select the tags to send communications accordingly.

Example: To send only six Push communications to your users in the next 6 days from all push campaigns and send only two push notifications in the next 6 days from campaigns with all the selected tags (Tags: all users, engagement, and promotion) and not more than twice to the users from location-triggered campaigns in the next 6 days, you can set frequency capping as follows.

Send a maximum of 6 Web and App push from all push campaigns to a user in 6 days.
Send a maximum of 2 Web and App push from all campaigns with all the selected tags (Tags: all users, engagement, promotion) to a user in 6 days.
Send a maximum of 2 Web and App pushes from location-triggered campaigns to a user in 6 days.
Working of FC in Push

Frequency capping limits the number of push notifications a user receives within a specified timeframe, based on the platform they are using. This capping operates at the user and platform level, not at the individual device level.

For example, consider a frequency cap set at two notifications over two days, the configuration will be:

Android: 2 notifications
iOS: 2 notifications
Web: 2 notifications

Scenario:

If a campaign targets Android, iOS, and Web, a user receives 1 notification per platform on Day 1. The frequency cap for each platform then reduces to 1.
If a subsequent campaign targets only Android and iOS on Day 2, users receive 1 notification per platform, assuming the two-day cap hasn't been reached for those platforms from other campaigns.
If a campaign later targets Android and Web, only Web users receive a notification if the Android frequency cap for that user was already met by previous campaigns within the two-day window.
info	If a user has multiple devices on the same platform (e.g., three Android devices) and the frequency cap is one per day, each of their Android devices may still receive one notification.

 

 
Applying FC in Different Scenarios
Scenario 	Configuration


Scenario 1: Based on campaign delivery type

Let's assume you want to send a maximum of six communications from Push for an upcoming week. Not more than three communications from one time/periodic campaigns and not more than three communications from event triggered campaigns via Push.

	

The configuration for scenario 1 is as follows,

Enable push and set a maximum of 6 communications from all push campaigns to a user in 7 days
Add a rule with a maximum of 3 communications from Web and App Push from one time/periodic campaign to a user in 7 days.
Add another rule with a maximum of 3 communications from Web and App Push from event triggered to a user in 7 days.

 




Scenario 2: Based on tags

Let's assume you want to send a maximum of 10 communications for an upcoming week. Not more than four communications from One time/periodic campaigns and not more than two communications from campaigns with all the selected tags (Tags: engagement, promotion) via Email notification.

 

	

The configuration for scenario 2 is as follows,

Enable Email and set a maximum of 10 emails from all email channels to a user in 7 days.
Add a rule with a maximum of 5 communications from one time/periodic campaign to a user in 7 days.
Add another rule with a maximum of 5 communications from all the selected tags (Tags: engagement, promotion) to a user in 7 days.



Scenario 3: FC for cross channel configuration

Let's assume you want to configure a frequency cap limited to 10 communications across all channels in 7 days. Not more than four communications should be sent from campaigns with all the selected tags (promotion, engagement).

	

The configuration for scenario 3 is as follows,

Set a cross channel configuration limit to a maximum of 10 communications from all campaigns/flows to a user in 7 days.
Add a rule under cross channel configuration with a frequency cap of 4 communications campaigns with all the selected tags (Tags: promotion, engagement). Remaining communications are sent from any other campaign delivery types which are processed on first-come first-serve basis.

 

Editing FC Rules

If you try to edit the tags in your frequency cap setting once it is saved, it resets the existing FC configuration, and the new FC setting is applied to the communication.

For example,

You have configured a frequency cap with a limit of four SMS & RCS communications and not more than two SMS & RCS from campaigns with any of the selected tags(Tags: activation and promotion) in the upcoming week. On the third day, If you try to add or remove any tags from the configuration, It resets the communication setting to zero, and the campaigns with any of the selected tags(Tags: activation and promotion) are eligible to receive more than two SMS & RCS communications.

Refresh setting

 Refresh setting helps you reset the frequency cap to your App's Timezone.

You can reset the Frequency Cap daily at 00:00 based on your app's or user's timezone for all supported channels. By default, it refreshes at 12 AM in the app's timezone for every user. Resetting the FC is useful if you send a late-night campaign and plan to send another the next day in the early morning.

Do Not Disturb

Do Not Disturb (DND) allows marketers to configure idle hours, at which time trigger notifications should not be sent to users.

Trigger campaigns are sent to users when they do a defined action within a defined time, for example, ""Added a product to cart"" but ""Not Purchased"" in 2 hours. Since the messages are sent based on user activity (with a delay set by the marketer), it is possible that some of these notifications (Push/Email/SMS & RCS) are triggered at odd hours. For example, if the user has added a product at 10 PM, the respective notification/message will be sent at midnight.


DND can be configured on the following channels and their respective delivery types. Channels other than those mentioned here do not support DND.


Channel Name	Campaign type with DND support
Push	Event Triggered, Location Triggered, Device Triggered
Email	Event Triggered
SMS & RCS	Event Triggered
WhatsApp	Event Triggered
Connectors	Event Triggered
Configuring DND for Channels

To configure DND for the above-mentioned channels:

Navigate to Settings -> Channels -> Delivery Controls -> Do not disturb tab.
Turn on the toggle for the channels for which you want to set up DND.
Once you enable DND settings for a channel, the following fields are enabled:
Do not disturb timing (User’s time zone) - You can specify the time interval in the user's time zone - the starting time for the DND interval and the ending time for the same in the From and To fields.
Action for messages generated during DND - 

After setting up the DND time interval, you can choose how you want to handle the messages generated during the DND period. The following actions are available:

Action	Description
Discard these messages and do not send them later	This option will discard the messages generated during the DND window.


Save and send all the queued messages

	

Select this option if you want to send all the notifications/emails/messages to the user after the DND period is over. If the user performs the trigger action for a campaign multiple times, they would be receiving the notification/email/message from a single campaign those many times.


Save and send message from only one campaign	Select this option if you want to send only one notification/email/message from each campaign. In this case, even if the user performs the trigger action for a particular campaign multiple times, he would receive only one notification/email/message from one campaign. This option would ensure that the user will not receive more than 'x' notifications (where 'x' campaigns are active on a day for the given channel).
Save and send only one message across <channel_name> campaigns	Select this option if you want to send at most one notification/message/email to the user. You might consider this option if you have campaigns running in other channels running as well, and you want to limit the total number of notifications/messages/emails that the user should receive.
Order in which queued messages should be sent - This option allows you to control the order in which the notifications will be delivered to the users. It's applicable to all actions except the Discard message option. The options available here are Send the most recent message first (Last in first out) and Send least recent message first (First in first out). 
Consider the example that a user becomes eligible for the following push notifications (PN):

PN1 at 11 PM

PN2 at 12.30 AM

PN3 at 5 AM

PN4 at 6.30 AM

Send the most recent message first (Last in first out): If you select this option, the user will first receive PN4, followed by PN3, then PN2, and then PN1 after the DND period is over. If the action selected is Send only one message across Push Campaigns, then the user will only receive PN4 (the most recent notification).
Send least recent message first (First in first out): If you select this option, the user will first receive PN1, followed by PN2, then PN3, and then PN4 after the DND period is over. If the action selected Send only one message across Push Campaigns, then the user will only receive PN1 (the least recent notification).
Gap between messages - This option allows you to set the delay or gap between multiple notifications/messages/emails. It is only applicable when you select either ""Send all the queued messages"" or ""Send only one message from each campaign"". 
Send all messages at once: Select this option if you want to deliver all the notifications/messages/emails in one go without any gap between two notifications.
Send messages at a gap of x mins: Using this option, you can set the time gap between the delivery of two notifications/messages/emails. For example, if you set the gap to five minutes, the second notification/message/email will be delivered five mins after the first one.

Settings 
Channels 
Delivery Controls
Minimum delay between campaigns

Marketers create multiple campaigns in a day, spaced by 5-10 mins. As much as marketers try to create a campaign that has non-overlapping segments, they cannot ensure that there are zero overlaps. Because of this, end-users receive more than one notification or message within 5-10 mins which deteriorates their experience.

To improve this notification/message delivery experience, marketers can ensure that two or more notifications/messages are not delivered in quick succession to any device/app/website using this setting. Marketers can configure a delay between two push/in-app/osm notifications delivered to a user.

If you do not want end users to receive two push notifications within 30 minutes, set the Minimum Delay between two notifications as 30 minutes. 

Example 1
If a user's device is eligible to receive notification N1 (sent using One Time or Periodic Push campaign C1) at time 1:00 pm UTC and N2 (sent using One Time or Periodic Push campaign C2) at 1:15 pm UTC. If the Min Delay setting is OFF, the user device will receive a campaign as per their Frequency Capping status. If the Minimum Delay setting is ON (and set as 30 mins), the user device will not receive N2.

Example 2
If a user's device is eligible to receive notification N1 (sent using One Time or Periodic Push campaign C1) at time 1:00 pm UTC and N2 (sent using Event-Triggered campaign C2) at 1:15 pm UTC. If the Min Delay setting is OFF, the user device will receive a campaign as per their Frequency Capping status. If the Minimum Delay setting is ON (and set as 30 mins), the user device will not receive N2.

Configure and Setup Minimum delay

To enable minimum delay, go to the following navigation in the MoEngage Dashboard and set the delay to the desired duration to control the communication being sent out.

Throttling allows you to control the rate at which communications (such as push notifications, emails, SMS & RCS messages, WhatsApp messages, or Webhook messages) are sent to users. This is helpful when you want to spread the load on your servers over a period of time instead of spiking the traffic. You can define the number of notifications or messages that can be sent per minute (requests per minute) for the MoEngage channels.

Configure Throttling at the Workspace Level

Perform the following steps to configure throttling at the workspace (global) level:

In the left navigation of the MoEngage dashboard, click Settings > Channels > Delivery controls > Throttling.
Under Campaign Throttling Limits, turn on the toggle for the required channel.
Set the throttling limit to the desired RPM. The throttling value cannot be lower than the minimum limit specified for the channel or greater than the maximum limit specified for the channel. The minimum, maximum, and default rates are displayed below each channel's setting.
Click Save.

Configure Throttling at the Campaign Level

In addition to the global throttling settings, you can configure different throttling settings for individual campaigns in step 3, Schedule and goals, of campaign creation if the option for throttling is available. For more information, refer to Supported Channels and Delivery Types.

You can configure the throttling at the campaign level under delivery controls, as shown in the image below:

Push
SMS & RCS
Email
Whatsapp
Connector

info	

Information

With the default FCM API rate limits reduced to 600,000 RPM, MoEngage is changing the maximum allowed throttle speed for push notifications to 500,000 RPM to ensure a single campaign does not breach the project limit. This change will apply to new and existing campaigns. You may still see drops because multiple campaigns are triggered together. For more information, refer to Changes in Sending Speed with Private Key Configuration.

 

MoEngage populates the default setting for throttling at the campaign level from the global settings.

Example:

If throttling for Push/SMS & RCS/Email/WhatsApp/Connector is enabled at the workspace (global level), the same throttling value will be shown by default in the Request limit field at the campaign level.

If throttling Push/SMS & RCS/Email/WhatsApp/Connector is disabled at the workspace (global level), the Request limit field at the campaign level will have the channel's default throttle value. Refer to the table below for the minimum, default, and maximum throttling values for all channels:

Channel	Default Throttling Value (notifications, messages, or emails) per minute	Minimum Throttling Value (notifications, messages, or emails) per minute	Maximum Throttling Value (notifications, messages, or emails) per minute
Push	100K	1K	
Non-personalized campaigns - 1M
Personalized campaigns - 250K
Recommendations campaigns - 250K

SMS & RCS	60K	1K	
Non-personalized campaigns - 200K
Personalized campaigns - 200K
Recommendations campaigns - 200K

Email	60K	1K	
Non-personalized campaigns - 225K
Personalized campaigns - 225K
Recommendations campaigns - 225K

WhatsApp	60K	1K

Recommendations campaigns - 200K

Webhook (Connector)	60K	1K	
Non-personalized campaigns - 200K
Personalized campaigns - 200K
Recommendations campaigns - 200K

Whether workspace-level (global) throttling is enabled or disabled, you can change the throttle speed while configuring a campaign and set different options for different campaigns. If the values in the workspace-level throttling and campaign-level throttling differ, the campaign-level throttling takes precedence and is applied.

Throttling in Sherpa Campaigns

Sherpa is the in-house AI of MoEngage that predicts the engagement proportion by creating different variations of audiences and analyzing their behavior. For more information, refer here. 

Throttling does not apply in Sherpa campaigns due to the campaigns' extended running time. To perform user distribution dynamically with Sherpa in Push campaigns, you must run them for at least 1 hour, whereas for Email campaigns, you must run them for at least 2 to 4 hours. The run time may vary according to the channel, which can be selected from the options provided in A/B testing.

info	

Information

Sherpa is available only for Push, Email, In-app Messaging, and On-site Messaging campaigns.

Throttling in Best Time to Send (BTS)

BTS  uses a prescriptive time slot to send communications to increase user interaction. BTS determines this by analyzing Push, SMS & RCS, and Email campaigns individually, predicting the optimal time slot from the (0-24 hour) bucket. In BTS, throttling takes precedence over the number of communications that should be sent in a particular time slot.

For example, the BTS is between 4 PM and 5 PM, with a volume of 15 million users. However, the throttling is limited to 200K RPM so that you can communicate only to 12 million customers in 1 hour (200k X 60 mins = 12 million). Because throttling takes precedence, you can communicate to the remaining 3 million users in the subsequent time slot (6 PM to 7 PM)."

Send campaign in recipient's time zone

Isn't it uncomfortable to deliver a campaign at 6 pm IST to your customer currently in PST who might be sleeping tight in his blanket? You will be committing two sins here: 1. disturbing your user, 2. getting ignored. You don't need to worry; we have your back!

MoEngage allows you to send the notifications to the users as per their local time zone i.e. If you schedule your campaign for 9:30 am IST, we will deliver to users in IST at 9:30 am IST and to users in PST at 9:30 am PST. 

Sending a campaign in the recipient's time zone

To send the campaign in the recipient's time zone:

While scheduling a general campaign, you can choose to send in the recipient's time zone by selecting the radio button for ""Send in user time zone"".

If the difference between your current time and your scheduled time is less than 24 hours, a few time zones would have passed. For those time zones you can decide to :

Not send any message to target users if the time zone has passed
Send the message in the campaign's default time zone i.e. EST for the example below.

info	

Support

Available in outbound channels - Push, Email, SMS
Available for scheduled (One Time and Periodic) campaigns

Make sure to also save the app timezone under Settings >> App - General >> General Settings

App timezone is needed to calculate the correct time zone for the users whose time zone information is not available. In absence of an app timezone, the users whose time zone details are not available will not be targeted.

To check the sending status:

Once you have created the campaign, you can check the delivery status across time zones in the Time zone based delivery section of Campaign Analytics.




You should be able to see these statuses. Their meaning is as under:

Not sent due to time lapse - Communication to users in this time zone has not been sent due to time lapse. The time lapse for a target time zone happens when the campaign is scheduled for a time that has already been passed in that target time while creating the campaign.
Sent - Communication to users in this time zone has been sent completely.
Sending - Communication to users in this time zone is being sent.
Pending - Communication to users in this time zone will be sent as and when the scheduled time is clocked in the respective time zone.
To know how many users lie in the certain time zone:

You can check how many of your users are in a certain time zone via our Segmentation query e.g. you want to check how many of the users are in Indian Standard Time (IST) which is UTC + 5:30 i.e. 330 minutes ahead of UTC, you can try the below-mentioned filter. 

Similarly, use value -330 for UTC - 5:30.

How does this work?

The feature uses Offset time (saved under User Info as e.g. +330 for TZ 5 hours 30 minutes ahead UTC) with respect to the Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) reported by/calculated from your user's device. We update Recipient's Time Zone as the last reported/calculated time zone of the user. There might be two cases here:

Recipient Time Zone Info is not available - Users for whom Time Zone Info is not available will receive the campaign in the time zone selected while the campaign is created. Check your application time zone at MoEngage Dashboard > Settings > General Settings.
Recipient Time Zone Info is available - If time zone info is available for users, we will send them as and when the campaign scheduled time is clocked in their time zone.

So when you schedule a campaign, we will try to understand what all time zones your app users fall in. We will start by sending to the first time zone for your app users. For any timezone, there can be three scenarios with respect to your scheduled campaign:

time has already passed in the recipient's Time Zone - Depending on your choice either we won't be sending the campaign to the users or send it in the campaign's default time zone
time is now - We will fetch the users fulfilling the segment criteria and start sending the campaign to the users at this timezone
time will occur later in the recipient's Time Zone - When the right time comes, we will identify the users fulfilling the segment criteria and we will send the campaign to these users in this time zone.

Since some time zones are ahead of that of marketer's, to ensure that no zones miss their scheduled time, one needs to set up these campaigns at least 24 hours before one wants it to go out in his/her time zone. To ensure that Scenario 1 (i.e. time has already passed) does not happen, it is strongly recommended to create your campaigns at-least 24 hours in advance if you are in World's last time zone.

Important note: The feature is not supported for campaigns targeting the segments created by CSV."

Global Control Group
Overview

The global control group is a list of users who will not receive any of your marketing campaigns. It is a strategically selected subset of the entire user base that is intentionally excluded from receiving any marketing campaigns across all available channels. For more information, refer to Control Groups.

The global control group is established at the account level, encompassing a segment of your entire user base. You can create only one global control group for each workspace. This group remains consistently excluded from all marketing campaigns across all channels and campaign types. Its primary objective is to provide a holistic, account-wide benchmark for measuring the overall incremental impact of your marketing activities.

The concurrent execution of numerous marketing campaigns introduces a challenge in accurately quantifying the incremental uplift attributable to specific initiatives. While an end-user may be intentionally excluded from receiving communication within one particular campaign (via a campaign-level control group), they may still be exposed to and influenced by communications from other simultaneously active campaigns, potentially leading to conversion. Consequently, to obtain a precise measurement of the true overall impact of marketing efforts, a global-level control group is necessary. This group, by design, remains entirely unexposed to any campaign communication, providing a reliable baseline for comparison and enabling the accurate determination of actual uplift.

When the global control group is created with random allocation, it is created for all the users in the workspace at that time. For example, if a control group is defined as having 10% of all users, one in every 10 users will be a part of this control group.
The user allocation to the global control group is completely random.
New users who are added to the workspace after the control group is created will also be included in the group, as per the defined percentage of all users in the random allocation. That is, one in every 10 new users will be included in the control group.
Uploading user list: In this method, you can upload a CSV file with a list of user IDs to create the global control group. All the users in the list will be added to the control group automatically.
Click the Upload users list option.
Click Upload file or drag and drop here to upload your CSV file.

Note: You can upload only a CSV file. The maximum file size for upload is 50 MB.
Select the Apply global control group in all existing campaigns check box if you want to apply the global control group to all existing campaigns. This will impact the existing scheduled or upcoming periodic campaigns.

Select the Allow marketers to send campaigns to these users check box if you want to allow marketers to decide during campaign creation whether to send campaigns to the users in the global control group. This is particularly useful when sending transaction communications or important messages such as mandatory app updates.
By default, the global control group applies to all new campaigns. Selecting this check box will allow marketers to decide whether to use the control group when creating campaigns.

Click Save changes. The Save changes to control group pop-up window appears, prompting you for confirmation. After you save the changes, they will be applicable to all the existing campaigns.

Configure Custom Domain (Link Branding)
Overview

This feature enables you to configure a custom domain to be used in the messages instead of the standard MoEngage Domain. A custom domain is a personalized domain name that lends your brand credibility and authority and differentiates you from the competition. Oftentimes, it becomes your brand's online identity. For example, it is common for customers to say Google it when they mean Google Search. Google's domain name is Google.com, and it is everyone's favorite moniker for the company's search feature!

The custom domain feature enables you to use your custom domain in the URLs sent in the message body of SMS, WhatsApp, or Email.

info	

Information

In the MoEngage Email context, Custom Domain is referred to as Link Branding.

For SMS & WhatsApp campaigns, any URL or link added to your message body is shortened with the chosen brand in the settings. For example, if the link used in the SMS or WhatsApp campaign is www.xyz.com/products/mobiles and the custom domain selected is yourbrand.com, then the link will be displayed as yourbrand.com/1234.

For Email campaigns, any URL or link in the Email’s body is wrapped with the chosen Custom Domain. For example, if the selected domain is yourbrand.com in the Email Campaign and the Email has a link as www.xyz.com/products/mobiles, then the URL will be rendered as www.yourbrand.com/abc.

Glossary
Terms and Definitions	Applicable for SMS & WhatsApp, Email	Notes
Domain: A domain is that part of the URL that directs your users to a web server to fetch the web page content they are looking for. To visit your webpage, users must type the domain name containing the location of your site's files. A domain is the principal part of the URL that denotes to whom this URL belongs. This helps the user identify the brand sending them this URL in their communication.	All	 
Domain Name: a unique string owned by the brand that can reflect the brand name without confusing the user. Examples: moengage.com, google.com, wikipedia.org. A custom domain is a purchased domain that allows you the flexibility to choose the name. For example, if you wish to name your domain YourBrand.com, you must purchase the domain name.	All	 
DNS: Domain Name System. It is popularly referred to as the phonebook of the internet. It maps the domain name to the actual address of the resource and helps the browser load the requested web page. For example, if you were to type google.com on your browser, the DNS server would look up the actual location where the website's pages are located and return them to the browser. The browser would then fire a request for that specific location and get the webpage to be displayed. For more information, refer to DNS.	All	 
CNAME: A canonical name or CNAME record is a type of DNS record that maps an alias name to a true domain name. For more information, refer to CNAME Record.	All	 
Click Tracking: A feature that tracks which users have clicked on the links added in the message. MoEngage's proprietary technology facilitates this. When a user clicks on a URL in the message body, the click action is tracked, and this event is logged. This is helpful in understanding click behavior and engagement.	All

SMS & Whatsapp
Email

If your domain name is yourbrand.com and you add the following link to your SMS or WhatsApp message body: http://www.yourbrand.com/producregistrationpage and shorten it using MoEngage’s default URL shortening, the URL will appear as ux.moengage.com/register. If you want your shortened URL to be YourBrand instead of ux.mnge.co, you should add a CNAME DNS record to your DNS, as shown below. The shortened URL would then be: yourbrand.com/register.

Name	Type	Value
YourBrand	CNAME	

ux.mnge.co

The 'X' in the API Endpoint URL refers to the MoEngage Data Center (DC). MoEngage hosts each customer in a different DC. You can find your DC number (value of X) and replace the value of 'X' in the URL by referring to the DC and API endpoint mapping here.

When you request a web page, here’s what happens:

A DNS request is created to look up the actual location where the resource is located for the domain name in the URL.
The DNS resolver finds the actual location mapped to the domain name (this is called resolving the DNS) by fetching the CNAME record.
This CNAME is returned to the browser. The CNAME helps the user's app/browser understand the server domain that needs to be requested.
The browser sends a new DNS request for the IP/domain mapped to the CNAME, and the web page for the requested resource is located and returned
Prerequisites
info	

Information

If you have Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) records set up for your domain to control the Certificate Authorities (CAs) that can issue SSL certificates for their domain, please add http://sectigo.com/ to the same before trying to set up a custom domain in MoEngage.

You need to set up a custom domain before configuring it in MoEngage. To set it up, do the following:

Look up a popular domain registrar (A domain name registrar provides domain name registrations to the general public. For example, GoDaddy and Google Domains)and look for a domain name that is not used.
Purchase the domain name. You can also purchase a custom domain from your web hosting provider. In case you have a custom domain, you can go ahead and skip to the next step.
Add a CNAME Record in your DNS to point to the MoEngage domain. For more information, refer to How CNAME Records Work.
Set the Time To Live (TTL) to 30 minutes for this record. 

Note: If your DNS provider doesn’t support 30 min TTL, select the minimal TTL time frame supported by your DNS provider.

Once the records and details are successfully added and verified on your DNS, you can add the custom domain in MoEngage.

info	

Information

 

You can use the same custom domain for SMS and WhatsApp. For Email, you need to set up a different custom domain.

Configure a Custom Domain

To configure a Custom Domain for the SMS, WhatsApp, and Email channels:

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard and select Settings -> Advanced settings -> Custom domain. You can create custom domains for SMS & WhatsApp or Email by clicking the respective tabs on the Custom domain screen.

SMS & WhatsApp
Email

Follow the below steps to configure custom domain for SMS & Whatsapp:

Make sure to follow the provided Pre-requisites to ensure that your custom domain is verified.
Add the custom domain name in the Custom domain name field and click Verify. You must not add http://,https:// or www. to the domain name. Add the name as added in the CNAME record.
After verification, you get a message stating that the custom domain is verified, as shown below.

Toggle Shorten and track URL by default to enable shortening and tracking of links added to SMS and WhatsApp messages using the custom domain. This will turn on the shortening and tracking of the URL for all SMS and WhatsApp campaigns. This ensures that tracking is automated and never missed. Also, it can be unchecked in the campaigns or turned off in the settings here when you do not wish to track clicks.
Campaign Previews

For SMS & WhatsApp, when you add a link to the message body and the Shorten and Track URLs option is selected, the preview will display a shortened link, as shown below.

SMS
WhatsApp

info	

Note

The URL displayed in the preview is only an example of how the real message body would look and is not the real URL that would be sent in the campaign.
To test how a user would receive the SMS, WhatsApp message, or Email use the Test Message(SMS), Test Campaign (WhatsApp, Email) feature and send a test message. You can view the URL as it would appear in your live campaign.

 

Troubleshooting

If you get the error ""Unable to verify. Check domain settings where this domain is managed and retry,"" make sure the DNS & CNAME mapping is done correctly in your specific Domain Registrar. To verify this, follow the steps your registrar has mentioned. If you don't have the required access, you can share these details with your IT admin, and they can help you in setting these up:

E.164 Phone Number Format
Introduction

The E.164 phone number format is an international standard for phone number representation. The International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) defines this format. E.164 numbers can have a maximum of 15 digits and include a country code, but do not include international call prefixes.

Key Components of E.164 Format

E.164 formatted phone numbers contain:

The prefix ”+”.
Country Code: This is a one- to three-digit code that identifies the country. For example, ""1"" is the country code for the United States and Canada, and ""91"" is the country code for India. For the full list of country codes, refer to Country Codes.
National Destination Code (NDC): This code identifies a specific region or network within the country.
Subscriber Number (SN): This is the unique number assigned to the subscriber.

Following is an example of a phone number in E.164 format:

An E.164 formatted phone number for a US number might look like this: +12125551234

""+"" indicates the prefix of the E.164 format.
""1"" is the country code for the US.
""212"" is the NDC (area code in this case).
""5551234"" is the subscriber number.
info	

Information

When including the country code, omit any leading zeros from the national phone number.
Hyphens, spaces, and parentheses are not included in the E.164 format.
Convert Local Formats to E.164

If you know the country code, you can easily convert a locally formatted phone number to an E.164 formatted number. Perform the following steps:

Remove any spaces, parenthesis or other punctuation.
If the number begins with a zero, remove the leading zero.
Prepend the country code.
Prepend a ”+”.
warning	

Warning

Phone numbers ingested into MoEngage must be in E.164 format. Invalid phone number format may lead to low deliverability of campaigns."

Authorization Configuration with OAuth 2.0

MoEngage allows you to configure OAuth 2.0 authentication services that fetch and refresh access tokens. As a marketer, while creating a custom connector campaign (in step 2 Content) or configuring a custom SMS connector, you can use OAuth 2.0 as authentication. For more information, refer to Create a Connector Campaign and Configure Custom Connector (Service Provider).

This article explains how to configure and manage OAuth 2.0 settings.

Add an OAuth 2.0 Configuration
Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard and select Settings > Advanced settings > Authorization configuration. The Authorization configuration page is displayed.
Click + Add OAuth config. The Setup Authorization page is displayed.


Adding an OAuth 2.0 configuration involves the following steps:

OAuth details: Define the target audience for the campaign.
Response settings: Define the content of the connector campaign to be sent or the custom SMS connector.
Step 1: OAuth Details

On the OAuth details tab, enter the following details:

OAuth name: Enter a name for OAuth configuration. These settings would be available for selection during campaign creation.
Grant type: Currently Client Credential grant type is supported. If you are using any other grant types, please raise a support ticket through MoEngage dashboard.

Token type: Select a token type. Supported values are:
Opaque: Select this option if the token issuer uses Opaque tokens. Here the response from the issuer will contain the expiry time alongside the opaque access token.
JWT: If you select this option, the access token and the expiry time is encoded in the response as JSON Web Token (JWT) in Step 2 Response settings. You must decode the response to get the expiry time.
Under API details, provide the details required to fetch the access token. Please check the API documentation of the OAuth service you plan to implement.
API URL: Enter the API URL.
Method: Select the API method. The following are the supported methods and available fields for each method:

Method	Supported Fields
GET	
URL parameters

If you have selected ""Opaque"" from the Token type drop-down list in Step 1 OAuth details, you will see only one OAuth delivery response field. The OAuth delivery response has a key with an expiry time, which is not encoded. You can also see when was the response received. 

 

 

Select an expiry option from the Expiry drop-down list and select a value from the second drop-down list. The values on the Expiry drop-down list depend on the kind of response received.

 

Preferred prefix: Select the preferred prefix of the OAuth setting.
Marketers can create custom prefixes in addition to the default options. These prefixes can be used when creating a custom connector or configuring a custom SMS connector, and can be overridden at a campaign level.
Preferred error codes: In the OAuth error code field, enter the preferred error code of the Oauth setting for an authorization failure because of an expired token. This error code can be used to reattempt the connector campaign or custom SMS connector.
Click Save. Now this Oauth setting is active. You can now use this Oauth configuration while creating a custom connector campaign or configuring a custom SMS connector.
Manage OAuth Settings
Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard and select Settings > Advanced settings > Authorization configuration. The Authorization configuration page is displayed. You can see the existing OAuth settings configured.

For example, if the conversion goal for your campaign is an Add To Cart event, attribution helps you understand when and how the user added the product to the cart - was it after seeing your push notification or was it after clicking on the notification or was it when there were already on the app looking for something.

info	

Information

If the Last Interaction model is enabled for you, refer to Campaign Attribution Settings.

Attribution Types

There are three attribution types in MoEngage: View through, click-through, and in-session attribution. 

Attribution Type	Description
View-through conversion	View-through attribution is the total number of conversion goals executed by users who received your communication within the configured attribution window from the time of receiving the campaign. This appears as a default filter in your Campaign Performance.
Click-through conversion	Click-through attribution is click-based tracking. Click-through attribution is the number of conversion goals executed by users who clicked the notification within the configured attribution window from the time of click.
In-session conversion	The in-session attribution is based on In-session tracking. The in-session attribution is the number of conversion goals executed by users within 30 minutes after clicking your communication.
Configuring Default Attribution Type

You can configure a default attribution type for all your Campaigns and Flows on the MoEngage Dashboard. The default attribution type is View through attribution unless selected otherwise in the settings, and this is applicable for all Campaigns and Flows, except Card Campaigns.

To configure the default attribution type for your MoEngage account:

Navigate to Settings -> Advanced settings -> Conversion and attribution.
Choose the Conversion view in the dropdown selector.
Click Save."

The following fields are available:
Field Name	Description
Default Attribution Model	

Choose the attribution model for your campaigns and flows by selecting one of the following:

All Interactions
Last Interaction

For more information about how each of these models works, refer to All Interactions model and Last Interaction model.


Conversion view	

Each attribution model has certain attribution types associated with it. Based on the attribution model chosen, you get the following options in this dropdown list:

The All Interactions model has the following options: View Through Attribution, Click Through Attribution, and In Session Attribution.
The Last Interaction model has the following options: Click Through Conversion and Total Conversions.
Click Save. You are prompted for confirmation about changing the attribution model or type. Click Done. 

You get a success message, as shown in the following image.

 

Switching Between Attribution Models

When you switch between attribution models, the campaign statistics pertaining to conversion are recalculated based on the model chosen.


For example, if the current setting is the All Interactions Model and there are campaigns with the same conversion goals and overlapping attribution windows, more than one campaign could get the attribution for the conversion. For more information, refer to All Interactions Model.

However, if the setting is changed to the Last Interaction Model, only the campaign with the deepest and latest attribution gets the attribution for conversion. Thus, some campaigns may experience a dip in conversion and revenue metrics when there is a switch from the All Interactions Model to the Last Interaction Model. Similarly, when there is a switch from the Last Interaction Model to the All Interactions Model, some campaigns may experience inflation in the conversion and revenue metrics. 

Switching Between Conversion Views

When you switch between conversion views, the metrics are shown for the attribution type selected in the Default Attribution Type in the Campaign Analytics and Info page changes based on the attribution type chosen.

For example, when the attribution model is All Interactions, and the default attribution type is View through attribution, the Campaign Analytics page shows calculated based on view through attribution. When you change the default to click-through, the statistics shown are for click-through attribution.

You can, however, change the attribution type in the Attribution Type filter in the Analytics section to see the metrics for other attribution types, as shown in the image below.

Adding Conversion Goals to Campaigns

You can define the conversion goals during the third step of campaign creation for all channels. To add a conversion goal to a campaign:

Click  in the Conversion Goals section.
In the Goal name field, add a name to the goal.
In the Event Name dropdown list, select an event to be associated with the goal.
In the Track goals for section, add the attribution window (the duration from the time user received/clicked the campaign, for which a conversion goal will be tracked.)for the campaign. For more information, refer to Attribution Window.
You can add multiple conversion goals to a campaign. You can track a maximum of five conversion goals for a campaign.
Use the Primary goal option to specify any of the goals added as the primary goal for the campaign.

For example, you want to track the number of customers who have purchased an iPhone after you send the campaign. (Event - purchase event, Product - iPhone). Your conversion goal setup might look to the goal in the following image:

With multiple conversion goals, you can track more than one business metric or visualize a funnel for your user actions. For example, you can check the following with multiple conversion goals:

How many users have viewed the product page?
How many of them added that product to the cart?
How many of them made a successful order?
Tracking Revenue Metrics

You can track revenue metrics for the primary conversion goal of a campaign. Enable the Revenue performance toggle for the primary goal.

Attribution Window

The attribution window is the duration for which the conversion goal is tracked for users from the time they receive or click a communication from a campaign or Flow.

For example, there is an end-of-season sale campaign offering discounts to customers with a conversion goal of purchasing a product (Product Purchase event) and an attribution window of 36 hours. John is a user who receives the campaign at 7 PM today. If John purchases a pair of jeans tomorrow at 10 PM, he is said to have converted. This conversion is attributed to the end-of-season sale campaign because John has achieved the conversion goal within the attribution window specified for the campaign. If John purchases the pair of jeans at 7:30 AM the day after tomorrow, the conversion is not attributed to the campaign.

The attribution windows for various channels and Flows are specified below:

Channel Name	Maximum Attribution Window
Push	36 hrs
SMS	10 days
Email	10 days
WhatsApp	10 days
InApp	36 hrs
OSM	36 hrs
Cards	36 hrs
Connectors	36 hrs
Flows	10 days

The minimum value for the attribution window is 1 hour for all channels and Flows.

Now that you have configured your attribution model and type, go to our Campaigns and Channels Section to create campaigns on various channels."

Overview - Alert Management

Alert Management enables you to configure and receive alerts when there are changes in the system that you would like to monitor and act upon proactively. For example, you can set up alerts to be sent to you when your Facebook account's token or your APNS token is about to expire. Similarly, when a campaign is experiencing a lot of failures within an hour or there is a sudden drop in stats, you can set up alerts to be notified about these occurrences. You then get a chance to monitor and take corrective action at the right time. This could help you improve customer engagement and ROI.

info	

Information

Alert Management provides two sets of alerts:

Custom alerts are currently part of the Enterprise plan.
System alerts are available for customers across all paid plans.

Alert Management provides a centralized way to set up, manage, and subscribe to receive alerts about events that you would like to be notified about without reaching out to developers or the support team. With this feature, you can create an alert, edit it, and subscribe to it by yourself.

With Alert Management, you can:

Receive information regarding issues with your campaigns or flows in a timely manner
Proactively address issues before they turn into major problems
Improve efficiency and productivity as no manual intervention is required to identify issues
Improve ROI with proactive and timely action 
Alert Types

There are two types of Alerts:

System alerts - These alerts are available in the Alert Manager by default. Some examples of the System or default alerts are Campaign Expiry, Facebook Token Expiry, and APNS Token Expiry. 
Custom alerts - These alerts are created and configured based on the criteria specified by you. For example, a custom alert could be set up to send a notification when the campaign stats of a periodic campaign see an increase in engagement metrics by over 20% within an hour.
Subscription Management for Alerts

When creating an alert, you can add subscribers (members of your team). You can also subscribe to or unsubscribe from receiving an alert in the Alert Manager. You can also add other team members as subscribers to the alerts from the Alert Manager. For more information, refer to Alert Subscription Management.

Use Cases
Receiving alerts for APNS and Facebook token expiries
Receiving alerts about campaigns that are expiring in the next fortnight
Receiving alerts for campaign failure
Receiving alerts when there are failures in campaigns that exceed a specified limit
Receiving alerts when there is a drop or increase in campaign stats below or above a specified limit within an hour or a set time
Receiving alerts for delivery failures when there are campaign delivery failures that exceed a specified percentage within a set time
Configuring custom alerts to get notifications for any event of your choice based on events specified by you.

Getting Started
Create an Alert

Ensuring a good campaign performance is crucial for marketers. Alerts provide real-time notifications of irregularities, helping you react promptly and optimize campaigns for better results. With alerts, you can analyze your campaigns in real time, identify and resolve any issues promptly, and ultimately ensure the success of your marketing efforts. By identifying issues like cost-per-conversion spikes or engagement drops, alerts empower you to make informed decisions and achieve campaign goals effectively, aligning with industry standards for efficient campaign management.

Use Cases
Failure rate exceeding a threshold
If you want to be alerted when a campaign's failure rate exceeds a specified threshold within a custom time window, you can set alerts to ensure timely corrective actions.
For example, you set an alert for a campaign's failure rate exceeding 10% in the last 6 hours, ensuring quick resolution when the threshold is breached.
Unsubscribe rate exceeding a threshold
Suppose you want to monitor unsubscribe rates over extended periods; you can set custom alerts to notify you when the rate exceeds a defined threshold, enabling proactive adjustments. For example, you set an alert for an unsubscribe rate exceeding 0.5% over 3 days, ensuring you can adjust the campaign when needed.
Failure rate increase compared to historical data
If you want to track deviations in campaign performance, set alerts comparing real-time failure rates with historical averages to receive early warnings of significant changes.
For example, you set an alert for failure rates increasing by more than 10% compared to the last 90 hours, ensuring quick action if performance deviates.
Create an Alert

You can create alerts from the Alert Management dashboard in MoEngage. However, you cannot create System Alerts. MoEngage offers role-based access control for account admins to enable different levels of access permissions (to dashboard components) for your team members. Only those roles that have permission to create custom alerts can do so. For more information, refer to Access Permissions.

Perform the following steps to create an alert :

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Settings > Reports and Alerts > Alert management.
On the Alert management page, click + Create alert.

How Alerts Work

MoEngage monitors campaign performance and triggers alerts when specified thresholds are met. The evaluation frequency and alert behavior depend on the campaign type and defined alert conditions. Below are examples of how alerts work for different delivery types:

info	

Information

This section specifically applies to alerts in Campaigns and Flows.

One Time Campaigns

A one-time campaign is a single-instance communication, such as a promotional email for a flash sale. After sending the campaign, the system evaluates the specified performance thresholds within the defined time frame. If the set threshold is breached, an alert is triggered.

Scenario
Configured Alert: Open rate < 10% to be evaluated one hour after the campaign is sent.
Evaluation: The system checks the open rate after one hour and sends an alert if the rate is below 10%. No further alerts are generated for this campaign.
Date	Time	Campaign Performance Status	Alert Notification
Feb 26	9:00 AM	Campaign sent	None
Feb 26	10:00 AM	Open rate = 7%	1 Notification 
Periodic Campaigns

A periodic campaign, such as a weekly newsletter, is sent on a scheduled basis. The system evaluates alerts at regular intervals (for example, every day or week) to track trends over time. If a performance threshold is breached during an evaluation, an alert is triggered.

Scenario
Configured Alert: Click-through rate (CTR) < 5% to be evaluated every 7 days.
Evaluation: The system checks the CTR every seven days. If the CTR drops below 5%, an alert is sent.
Date	Time	Campaign Performance Status	Alert Notification
Feb 1	9:00 AM	Newsletter sent	None
Feb 8	9:00 AM	CTR= 4.5%	1 Notification 
Feb 15	9:00 AM	CTR= 6%	No notification

For Periodic alerts, data considered is from Feb 1 to Feb 8 for the first alert and then from Feb 8 to Feb 15 for the second alert.

Event-Triggered Campaigns

User actions, such as a transaction confirmation email, activate an event-triggered campaign. The system continuously monitors performance within a set evaluation period (for example, every 12 or 24 hours). If the threshold is breached during any evaluation window, an alert is triggered.

Scenario
Configured Alert: Email delivery rate < 90% to be evaluated within a 24-hour window.
Evaluation: The system checks the delivery rate every 24 hours. If it drops below 90% during any evaluation, an alert is sent.
Date	Time	Campaign Performance Status	Alert Notification
Feb 25	9:00 AM	Campaign sent	None
Feb 26	9:00 AM	Delivery rate = 92%	No Notification 
Feb 27	9:00 AM	Delivery rate = 88%	1 Notification
Feb 28	9:00 AM	Delivery rate = 85%	1 Notification

For Event-triggered alerts, data considered is from Feb 25, 9:00 AM to Feb 26, 9:00 AM for the first alert, and then Feb 26, 9:00 AM to Feb 27, 9:00 AM for the second alert, and so on.

Example

The following example illustrates how to set up an alert when your campaign's failure rate decreases by more than 10% from its start time.

On the Create Alert page, in the General details section, type the Alert Name as Test_Alert_Stats.

In the Create Alerts On list, click Campaign Stats.
In the Alert Condition section, enter the details as mentioned below:
In the Evaluate Condition on list, click Campaign Start time.
Choose the metric for which you want to set up the alert in the Send alert when list and select the operator as Decreases by more than.
Select the percentage in the textbox and choose Hour in the Hour/Day list.
You can compare this rate with respect to the moving average of the last 'x' hours or days.

Configure the Filter by conditions and add relevant members to the respective section.

Click Create.
Now that the alert is created, you can view and manage it from the Alert Manager. For more information, refer to Manage Alerts."

Miscellaneous
Settings - Inform

There are two configurations for Inform on the MoEngage Dashboard:

API Settings - displays the Workspace ID and API SECRET.
User Attribute Settings - allows you to enable or disable user attributes to be used as fallbacks for personalizing the Alert.
API Settings

To access the Inform API settings, navigate to MoEngage Dashboard -> Settings -> APIs -> General Settings -> Inform.

The following parameters are available:

Workspace ID - When you create an account in MoEngage, you will be assigned a unique identifier called the Workspace ID. This value will be used for identifying your account and authenticating it.
API SECRET - API SECRET is the authentication key provided along with your Workspace ID. You can regenerate the API SECRET by clicking on the Regenerate API Secret icon. Note: MoEngage does not recommend regenerating the key unless there is a security breach. Once you generate and save a different API SECRET, API calls using the older SECRET won't work.
User Attribute Settings

The User Attributes available in MoEngage's user profile can be added as fallbacks for personalization in Inform. For example, if you want to send 'name' as a parameter in your alert and its value is not passed in the API request (as the microservice didn’t know the value for 'name') while sending the alert, you can define a fallback. You can configure the fallback to be fetched from the user attribute (that contains the value for the 'name' parameter in the request) of the user for whom the alert is being sent. If this fallback is not available for the requested user, you can define a default value to be used for completing the request.

Note: If User Attributes are enabled, the SLAs for an Inform request will increase from 3 seconds (p90) to 4 seconds (p90).

To utilize user attributes as part of Text personalization fallbacks, do the following:

Navigate to MoEngage Dashboard -> Settings -> Inform -> User Attributes.
Turn on the Enable user attributes toggle.
Click Enable in the popup to confirm the higher SLA for further Inform requests.


After enabling user attributes, you’ll be able to define the fallbacks based on them, and subsequent API calls will start considering the user attributes as part of the fallback algorithm. For more information, refer to Personalization using User Attributes."

Data 
Key Concepts
Overview - Data

Data is any information that you wish to store, analyze and track. When you onboard with MoEngage, one of the first things to do would be to integrate your data into MoEngage through various options. This data typically consists of user attributes and events used to create segments and run analytics and campaigns.

Types of Data
User - User data contains information about the user and is available in the User Profile for any user in the system. For every user, the following information is available in MoEngage - MoEngage derived attributes or standard attributes and any custom user attributes that can be sent to MoEngage. MoEngage generates derived attributes based on user behavior. For more information, refer to User Profile and Derived User Attributes.
Device - A user can have multiple devices associated with them, and this is stored in MoEngage as Device Data. Device-specific attributes such as the advertising identifier (the unique user ID associated with a mobile device to help advertisers personalize their offerings) are available in the User Profile.
Event - An event is an occurrence tied to user behavior or action. For example, logging in, logging out, viewing a web page, adding an item to a cart, and so on. Event data contains information about such events. Events are classified as follows:
Derived Events - MoEngage generates a list of standard events based on user actions and behavior called derived events. For more information, refer to Derived Events.
Custom Events - You can define the events that are specific to your business and track them with MoEngage.
Auxiliary - Auxiliary data is temporary data that you can import to MoEngage. For more information, refer to Auxiliary Data.
Data Operations

The following operations can be performed with Data:

Create and Update - Data can be created and updated in MoEngage using the following:
Type	SDK	S2S APIs and Bulk Upload APIs	File Imports (CSV, S3, and SFTP)	Partner Integrations (CDPs and CRMs)
User	

Create, Update

	Create, Update	Create, Update	Create, Update
Device	

Create, Update

	Not Supported	Not Supported	Not Supported
Event	Create	Create	Create	Create
Delete - Data can be deleted from MoEngage using the GDPR/CCPA API. For more information, refer to Erase API.
Data Management

MoEngage equips you with a Data Management Dashboard to help you manage your data effectively. You can:

Block or hide unnecessary events, event attributes, and user attributes
View all the event and user attributes integrated with MoEngage
Add meaningful display names for attributes (event and user) to help your marketers understand their purpose
Specify allowed data types for attributes - this will help show the relevant operators pertaining to the permitted data types during segmentation and analytics.

For more information, refer to Data Management.

Data Exports

All user events and campaign events that have been received or generated by MoEngage can be exported to Partner tools using:

Data Warehouse Exports (AWS, GCP, Redshift, BigQuery)
MoEngage Streams to Partner tools.

The exported data can be analyzed further to glean insights into user behavior, preferences, and what have you."

Data 
Key Concepts
Event Naming Conventions
Overview

When it comes to naming events, it's beneficial to follow some conventions to ensure consistency and clarity across your tracking implementation. Clear and intuitive event names help in effectively communicating the purpose of the event being tracked when working collaboratively or analyzing event data at a later stage. By using human-readable event names, you can ensure that the events are self-explanatory and do not require additional explanation or deciphering.

Best Practices

Here are some event naming conventions to consider:

Use clear and descriptive names: Choose event names that accurately describe the user action being tracked. Make sure the name concisely communicates what happened, without being overly technical or ambiguous.
Be consistent: Establish a set of naming conventions for events and stick to them throughout your tracking implementation.
Use lowercase and underscores or dashes: Most operating systems are case-sensitive; always use lowercase for event names and separate multiple words with underscores (_) or dashes (-) for better readability. For example, ""video_playback_started"" or ""checkout_completed"".
Use verbs for action-based events: Start event names with verbs to indicate actions. For example, ""user_signed_in"", ""item_added_to_cart"", or ""form_submitted"".
Include relevant object or context information: If an event involves a specific object or context, include it in the event name. For example, ""product_purchased"" or ""article_shared"".
Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms: While abbreviations might save characters, they can also introduce confusion. It's generally better to use complete words that are easily understood by all team members.
Keep event names concise: Try to keep event names as short as possible while still maintaining clarity. Long event names can be unwieldy and difficult to work with.

You can adjust the above conventions to fit your specific needs and requirements. The key is to choose a convention that aligns with your team's understanding and enables easy interpretation of the event data.

Recommendations
We recommend naming an event with a minimum of 5 characters.

User/Event property values are limited to 512 characters in length.
Non-ASCII characters need to be escaped.
Do not start your user or event attributes with ""moe"". MoEngage may not track event names starting with ""moe"".
Example:
moe_addtocart 
addToCart  
AddToCart 
Add_to_cart 
Add-to-Cart 

Whenever possible, use the same names across your mobile apps and websites for consistency.
Group similar events with a common prefix. For example, ""booking_initiated"", ""booking-dates-selected"", ""BookingRoomSelected"", and ""Booking_completed"".
Use an underscore or a hyphen between the words instead of spaces. Space-filled attributes cannot be read and may cause your use case to fail.
Creating every user action as an event will make it harder to find meaningful answers in a pool of events. Employ more general events rather than specific ones. For example, instead of three individual events such as ""video_start"", ""video_pause"", and ""video_end"", use a ""video_watched"" event with ""Duration"" as a property value.
Do not capture screen loads or unloads, button clicks, or form submissions. Instead, record user actions that are in line with your business objectives.
Do not capture page views as events, or page URLs as event properties. You can get better insights into how people use your product than by the pages they visit.
For objects datatype attributes, please maintain a different name for the object attribute and the attributes or keys inside the object.
Prohibited Characters

Do not use any of the following special characters or symbols in your event names:

$ dollar sign
. dot
< left angle bracket
+ plus sign
% percent
> right angle bracket
< left angle bracket
+ plus sign
% percent
> right angle bracket
! exclamation point
` backtick
& ampersand
* asterisk
# pound
| pipe
{ left curly bracket
? question mark
"" double quotes
= equal sign
} right curly bracket
/ forward slash
: colon
emojis
\ backslash
blank spaces
@ at sign
' single quotes

This list is meant to help you avoid common errors while naming events. If you have any questions, reach out to the support team.

Reserved keywords
MoEngage standard events are usually tracked as 'moe_eventname'. As mentioned earlier, avoid naming your events starting with moe.
Refer to the list of standard/derived events tracked by MoEnage and avoid duplicacy in your custom events"

Data 
Key Concepts
Fair Usage Policy (FUP)
Overview

A Fair Usage Policy (FUP) is a set of guidelines and rules implemented to ensure all customers have equal and non-discriminatory access to MoEngage resources.

It helps in the following ways:

Secures your workspace from unregulated external data tracking, which might increase your user count and overall integrity of data tracking.
Ensures the fair allocation of MoEngage resources among all its customers. It ensures that large data ingestion caused by improper integration from a limited number of customers does not negatively impact data tracking for other customers.

MoEngage proactively identifies instances of FUP violations and blocks end-user level data tracking. As a marketer, you can still find these users in your workspace and send campaigns to them.

How Does the Fair Usage Policy Work?

MoEngage has configured the data request limit above which the FUP is violated by analyzing the recent trends in the data tracked using the SDK, and hence, these FUP limits are rarely breached.

Whenever an end-user breaches the maximum number of data requests allowed, MoEngage temporarily blocks the data tracking of the user for a specific time limit. The duration of the temporary block depends on the time interval and the number of data requests received in that interval. However, despite the temporary block, if a user continues to breach the FUP limit two more times consecutively, the data tracking of that user is permanently blocked. For more information, refer to Fair Usage Policy Limits and Actions.


Fair Usage Policy Limits and Actions

The following table showcases the FUP limits and actions taken if the limit is breached for a given end user.

Time Interval	Maximum Number of Data Requests Allowed in the Specified Time Interval	Action Taken If the Maximum Data Request Limit Is Breached
1 minute	100	Blocks the tracked data of that user for the next 1 hour.
5 minutes	300	Blocks the tracked data of that user for the next 1 hour.
1 hour	500	Blocks the tracked data of that user for the next 24 hours.
1 day	1000	Blocks the tracked data of that user for the next 24 hours.
warning	

Warning

For any of the above time intervals, the limit breach can occur a maximum of three consecutive times before a permanent block is imposed. If a permanent block is imposed, that user's data tracking is permanently blocked.

Data Archival Policies

MoEngage saves all the needed data for campaign segmentation, personalization, and analytics. However, to optimize the time taken to send out campaigns and run segmentation queries, the data that is not required is automatically archived.

Segmentation and Campaign Management

MoEngage saves all the user data that you send to us in the form of events, users, and devices and has the below policies for archiving these data formats when they can no longer add any value to your MoEngage activities:

Type	Archival Policy	Reason
Events*	By default, events are available for Segmentation for 60 days (or) 1 year depending on your subscription plan.
i.e. you can segment users if the event is done/not done in the last 60 days.
The event retention period can be extendable on request, to multiple years and even lifetime retention.	For a good number of businesses, user activity beyond 60 days provides minimal incremental value to their campaign performance. Companies can choose the Event Retention policy, based on their needs.
Users
(Anonymous)	Users who are not identified AND are not reachable on either channel (push, email, or SMS) AND have been inactive for 60 days are archived automatically	Saving unidentified, unreachable, and inactive users unnecessarily inflates your All User base and deteriorates your experience.
Users (Identified)	Users who are identified with ID / Email_id / Mobile Number and haven't been active and haven't received any Push/Email/SMS campaign for the last 1 year are archived automatically	This is customizable
Devices	

We archive devices that have not received any requests and are inactive for 60 days

	Saving unreachable and inactive devices may increase your push campaign sending time marginally while providing no benefit in terms of outreach.
info	

Note

The above archival policies are customizable on a use-case basis. Please reach out to your MoEngage Account Manager or raise a support ticket for more details.
We can provide extended event retention periods and you can always reach out to your Account Manager or raise a support ticket, if and when required.
MoEngage allows ingestion of data beyond the data retention policy (DRP), But our Segmentation service will allow you to query the data only based on your DRP. Our Data Storage services delete data beyond DRP periodically.
Analytics

We save all the data (users and events) for 1 or 2 years (and beyond) in MoEngage Analytics depending upon your subscription plan. We have longer default retention periods for analytics as you may want to analyze your Behavioral trends, Funnels, and Retention over multiple months."

Data Tracking Policies

Although MoEngage can ingest any amount of data that is being sent to us, we enforce certain limits on how you are tracking this data to ensure that the changes you make in data integration do not hamper the sanity of your data in MoEngage and for you to have a seamless experience while using this data to create and analyze your campaigns and user trends.

Limits on Events and Attributes Tracked in MoEngage

The below limits apply when you track data in MoEngage:

Type	Limit	Handling for overage
Unique Events	512	Events not tracked in the last 60 days will be removed first, and then new events will be blacklisted if the limit is still breached.
Unique User Attributes	256	New User Attributes will be rejected if limit breaches
Unique Event Attributes	100 per event	Only the first 100 event attributes will be ingested.

These limits don't represent any volume limits for Events / User attributes, these only represent the unique number of custom events / attributes that can be tracked, from a fair usage policy standpoint.  If you need to exceed the above limits, contact your Customer Success Manager or the MoEngage Support team. In case you are already breaching these limits, we will not blacklist existing events and attributes automatically. Still, if you send new events and attributes, these will get blacklisted based on the logic mentioned in the above table. Do reach out to us if you have any issues here.

To contact the MoEngage Support team, you can raise a ticket through the Support Web Form within the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer here.
 

Limits on Event & Attribute Names and Values 

The following table lists the limit values on events, attribute names.

Key	Character Limit	Limit Breach Handling
Event name length	200	Store the first 200 characters only.
User attribute name length	200	Store the first 200 characters only.
User attribute value length	512	Store the first 512 characters only
Event attribute name length	200	Store the first 200 characters only.
Event attribute value length	512	Store the first 512 characters only.
Supported Datatypes 

MoEngage will accept the below datatypes for attributes:

Key	Allowed Data Types	Other Datatypes

Event Attribute Value	Integer, Float, Double, Long, Boolean, String, Datetime, Array<Long>, Array<Int>, Array<Double>, Array<Short>, Array<Float>, Array<String>, Objects, Array of Objects	Ignore


Additional Information for Data Tracking in MoEngage:

For lists, each element can be a maximum of 512 characters and a maximum of 50 elements per list.
For sending an attribute of datatype - datetime, please use the ISO 8601 date format (e.g. 2020-05-31T16:33:35Z) while sending data from our Data APIs and use our SDK date functions when sending data from the SDK directly. Please check with your Customer success team in case you are not able to send a certain ISO 8601 supported formats, the most commonly accepted formats are %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ; %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ
If your attribute value is a URL and this exceeds the allowed character limit of 512 characters, we will reject the value completely. This is done to ensure that your image and URL personalization do not break.


For Arrays, the Array datatype should be homogenous (all the values in an array should be of the same datatype), and data typecasting is supported at an array level. For more information about typecasting, refer to Data Typecasting."

Introduction

An Object is a versatile data type that holds data in a key-value pair. An object can hold a single or multiple key-value pairs. As a marketer, you may want to segment users depending on a specific item they have added to their cart. There may be enumerable attributes that define the specified item, which can be encapsulated in a single object and can used to identify the item. For example, you want to log a list of users who added the book Atonement to their cart. The book can be defined using the following Object:

Code
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	""book"":{

	      ""product_name"": ""Atonement""

	      ""price"" : 100,

	      ""sku"": ""abc123""}

In addition to the existing data type attributes such as string, numeric, and boolean, you can use the Object data type to run deeper queries and create custom user segments for more personalized marketing campaigns.

Types of Objects

MoEngage supports the following types of objects:

Simple Object

A simple object consists of an element holding multiple key-value pairs, as shown below:

Code
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	""book"":{

	      ""item-type"": ""apparel"",

	      ""item-cost"": 90,

	      ""item-currency"": ""USD""

	      },

	      {

	      ""item-id"": 523,

	      ""item-type"": ""food"",

	      ""item-cost"": 200,

	      ""item-currency"": ""USD""

	      }

	      ]
Nomenclature Used in the Object Data Type

Consider the following object Stationary:

Code
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	""Stationary"":{

	      Level 1 ""item-id"": 123, 

	      Level 1 ""item-type"": ""books"",

	      Level 1 ""item-cost"": {

	      Level 2                ""amount"": {

	      Level 3                ""cost-price"": 100,

	      Level 3                ""discount"": 0,

	                             }

	      Level 2                ""currency"": ""USD""

	                           }

	      }

The terms of the Object data type are described below:

Terms	Description
Object attribute	

In the example above, Stationary is the object attribute consisting of key-value pairs or sub-attributes.

The Stationary object will also be considered a root object, which can have objects nested within it.


Sub-attributes	

Sub-attributes are the key-value pairs inside the object attribute. In the example above:

item-id, item-type, cost-price, discount, and currency are the sub-attributes or the key-value pairs.

item-cost, and amount are the nested objects which have their own sub-attributes or key-value pairs.


Level 1 sub-attribute	Level 1 is the first level of sub-attribute nesting.
Level 2 sub-attribute	Level 2 is the second level of sub-attribute.
Level 3 sub-attribute	Level 3 is the third level of nesting.
Key Factors for Object Data Type Ingestion
Factors	Description
Max size of Object (bytes)	

The default size is 25 KB.

Every object attribute containing key-value pairs should not exceed 25 KB.

For example, an object book, as shown below, is considered an object attribute in MoEngage with multiple sub-attributes or key-value pairs:

""book"":{
""product_name"": ""Atonement""
""price"": 100,
""sku"": ""abc123""
}

The overall size of the object book should not exceed 25 KB.


Max key-value pairs (sub-attributes)	

100 sub-attributes supported inside an object attribute. You can archive unused sub-attributes within an object and ingest new sub-attributes through the Data management dashboard.

""book"":{
""product_name"": ""Atonement""
""price"": 100,
""sku"": ""abc123""
}

The above example has three key-value pairs or sub-attributes.


Max number of array elements	

100 is the maximum limit supported for the number of array elements in an Array of objects.

""product"":[
{
""item-id"": 123,
""item-type"": ""books"",
""item-cost"": 100,
""item-currency"": ""USD""
},
{
""item-id"": 323,
""item-type"": ""apparel"",
""item-cost"": 90,
""item-currency"": ""USD""
},
{
""item-id"": 523,
""item-type"": ""food"",
""item-cost"": 200,
""item-currency"": ""USD""
}
]

The example above has three array elements.


Max level of nesting	

MoEngage supports a maximum of two levels of nesting, and anything more than that will be stringified.

However, MoEngage ingests any level of nested JSON.

""Stationary"":{
Level 1 ""item-id"": 123, 
Level 1 ""item-type"": ""books"",
Level 1 ""item-cost"": {
Level 2 ""amount"": {
Level 3 ""cost-price"": 100,
Level 3 ""discount"" : 0,
}
Level 2 ""Currency"": ""USD""

}
}

In the example above, sub-attributes such as cost-price and discount are level 3 nested sub-attributes; they are ingested into MoEngage but in a string datatype.


Key names	

Max length is 200 characters.

Key names should not have the following special characters: $, . , %, #.

""book"":{
""item-id"": 123,
""item-name"": ""Atonement"",
""item-cost"": 100,
""item-currency"": ""USD""
}

Item-id, item-name are key names which do not exceed 200 character limit.


Key-values	

Max limits (default = 512 characters) follow our recommended limit for primitive data types.

""book"":{
""item-id"": 123,
""item-name"": ""Atonement"",
""item-cost"": 100,
""item-currency"": ""USD""
}



Values corresponding to key names such as Item-id and item-name are called key values. Here, the key values are 123 and Atonement, which do not exceed the 512-character limit.


Not an identifier	

Object attributes should not be marked as primary or secondary IDs in MoEngage.

Object attributes comprising sub-attributes cannot be used as a User Identifier in MoEngage to create or update new users. Primitive data type attributes (for example, CustomerID in string datatype) need to be used.


No logical operation	

Object data types do not support logical operations.

Perform such operations on Object.child (if it is of primitive type).

""book"":{
""item-id"": 123,
""item-name"": ""Atonement"",
""item-cost"": 100,
""item-currency"": ""USD""
}

In the previous example of an object attribute book, logical operations can be performed against the sub-attributes inside the book object but not on the book as a complete object.

For example,

A logical operation that can be considered valid is book.item-cost < 150.
A logical operation that is considered invalid is book < 150.


PII or masked or blocked or hide	

The entire object attribute can be marked PII or encrypted.

Sub-attributes or individual key-value pairs inside an object cannot be marked as PII, encrypted, blocked, or hidden separately.


Max Object-type Attributes	

By default, MoEngage allows a maximum of five attributes (user or events) as Object data types.

That is, five user attribute objects and five event attribute objects totaling 10 object attributes.


Custom attributes only
(both User and Event)	

Only custom attributes can be an Object data type.

Attempting to send an Object data type on standard attributes will not be accepted.

Standard or derived attributes are data attributes that MoEngage tracks through the MoEngage SDK. You can find these attributes at Settings > Analytics and Data > Data management in the MoEngage dashboard. These attributes are not Object data types.


Null handling	

If the incoming Object type attribute is Null or empty, it is not ingested into MoEngage.

If an object consists of an attribute that has no values among other attributes which have value, that object is partially ingested whereas the attribute with blank/null value is not ingested:

""product"":[
{
""item-id"": 123,
""item-type"": ""books"",
""item-cost"": 100,
""item-currency"": ""USD""
},
{
""item-id"": null,
“”: 100
},
{
""item-id"": 523,
""item-type"": ""food"",
""item-cost"": 200,
""item-currency"": ""USD""
}
]

Data ingested into MoEngage is as shown below:

""product"":[
{
""item-id"": 123,
""item-type"": ""books"",
""item-cost"": 100,
""item-currency"": ""USD""
},
{
""item-id"": 523,
""item-type"": ""food"",
""item-cost"": 200,
""item-currency"": ""USD""
}
]
Ingest Object Data Type

Snowflake

The Object data type is supported in Snowflake as well.

Store Compatible JSON Data in Snowflake

To store valid JSON inside Snowflake, you must change the data type of the column to VARIANT type. For more information, refer here.

The JSON stored inside Snowflake should be a valid JSON; otherwise, the values will not be written as JSON. Here is an example JSON column:

JavaScript
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{ ""Designation"": ""SSE"", ""Palace"": ""Banglore"", ""age"": 30, ""name"": ""Shasha"" }
Import JSON Data via Snowflake

Existing attributes in MoEngage that have been marked as an Object type and are available to map to columns in Snowflake:

You can always create new Object attributes from the mapping step as well, as shown below:

info	

Information

MoEngage does not support mapping with nested attributes. Only top-level attributes are available to map.

Zapier

Zapier now supports creating users and events with object-type attributes. To mark an attribute as an object type, you need to define these attributes inside the Object-type Attributes list:

Any attribute with an invalid JSON value is dropped. The same flow applies to the Import User Event Action.

info	

Information

Any attributes that are intended to be Object type but are defined under the Custom Attributes list are sent to MoEngage as strings. Here, the default type casting conversion rules of MoEngage are applied based on the attribute’s pinned data type.

Exceptions
Only five objects can be ingested for each workspace by default.
Elements inside an object or in an array_objects are dropped if nulls or blanks exist.


Sr. No.

	Sample Payload	MoEngage Behavior
1	attribute0 : {}	Dropped
2	attribute01 : { }	Dropped
3	Attribute61 : [{ ""a"" : {} }, {""valid"" : false}]	[{""valid"": false}] is ingested, rest of the elements are dropped
4	{"""": ""value"" }	Dropped
A heterogeneous array of objects is not supported. An array of objects should only consist of objects as the array elements.
Case 1: If there is a mix of objects and primitive elements, primitive elements are dropped.
Case 2: If there are no objects in the array but the array consists of other primitive elements, MoEngage takes the first element’s datatype as the reference datatype and attempts to typecast the rest of the elements into that datatype. If this attempt is unsuccessful, the elements are dropped.
Use Object Data Type

This section describes how to use the Object data type.

Data Management

After ingesting your Object data type attributes in MoEngage, you can manage them in the Data management section of the MoEngage dashboard. To edit an Object data type, follow the steps below:

Navigate to your MoEngage dashboard and click Settings > Analytics and Data > Data management > User attributes or Events.
Select the user attribute of the Object data type or search for one using the search bar.

Click the vertical ellipsis on the attribute row and click Edit.

Modify your Object structure. For example, change the string attribute to boolean, numeric to string, and so on.

Click Save. A warning is displayed on saving the modifications.

Click Continue to confirm.

info	

Information

 

You can edit the Object attribute once every 24 hours. For the same reason, the edit option will only be activated 24 hours following the current edit.

Activities Allowed on Object Attributes in Data Management
You can pin data type as Object or Array of Object for any custom user or event attribute.
For any Object or Array of Object data type, the system auto-detects the object's structure and saves it as metadata for segmentation.
The structure detected must have all children of the Object and their data type up to two levels.
You can manually define each child node for any Object or Array of Object type attribute.
If the schema of an Object attribute is defined manually, it cannot be modified for 24 hours (to avoid unwanted issues with any running campaigns/triggers). After the schema is manually defined, any incoming data is validated against it and rejected if it does not conform to the definition.
For any Object or Array of the Object type attribute, you can paste a sample JSON to generate a defined Object structure.
You can specify the data type of each child node up to two levels. The data types supported are as follows:
Numeric
Boolean
String
Date type
Primitive Array
JSON (to ingest any level of nested object)
You can create more than 100 children nodes for any object definition. If an object has more than 100 children nodes, MoEngage accepts only the first 100 children nodes defined earlier.
If an existing attribute is pinned as an object, the previous values are not type-casted and left as they are.
New values coming in for the attribute are treated differently for different scenarios as follows:
If the incoming value is an object under defined limits, it will be accepted.
If the incoming value is a primitive data type (number, string, bool), it is encapsulated and typecasted as an object.
You can change the data type of an attribute pinned as an object to “Any” or any of the primitive data types.
You can change Block/Unblock and Show/Hide sub-attributes of the Object data type for only root-level attributes.
You can edit the schema of Object data type attributes in the following manner:
Add new sub-attributes to the object for up to two levels of nesting.
Delete existing sub-attributes.
Exceptions
An attribute can ingest data as an object or as any primitive data type.
Any attribute that has ingested any data point of the object data type cannot be encrypted.
Any attribute that has been ingesting data in any primitive data type and marked as PII encrypted attribute cannot ingest object data points going forward.
User Profile

This section describes the user profile.

User Info

After you ingest your Object data type attributes in MoEngage, you can view them in the User Profile section on your MoEngage dashboard. To view the Object attribute, follow the steps below:

Navigate to your MoEngage dashboard and create a Segment with object attributes.
On the Create segment page, scroll down to the Query Results section and then select a query.
Select a sample user to navigate to the User Profile page. Alternatively, use the upper right search bar to search for a user with an ID.
You can view all your object-type attributes on the User Profile page under the Tracked Custom Attributes section.

Activity Info

To view the object attribute associated with an event in activity info, follow the steps below:

Navigate to your MoEngage dashboard and create a Segment with Object attributes.
On the Create segment page, scroll down to the Query Results section and then click a query to expand it.
Select a sample user to navigate to the User Profile page. Or search for a user (using user ID) in the user search box on the upper right corner of the Create segment page.
From the User Profile page, go to the Activity Info tab, where you can view all your events and event attributes in the object type section.

User Data
User Profile

User Profile is a 360° view of a user you are saving with MoEngage. User Profile stores data you collect about your users such as their first name, email address, subscription status, or the pages they visited on your website.

User Profile is created and updated anytime a user opens your app or website that has MoEngage SDK, or you upload user information through the UI or via API.

info	

Note

Although MoEngage can ingest any amount of data, we follow a fair usage policy for data tracking and archiving, to prevent any misuse.

Accessing User Profile

 Two ways to access the User Profile on the MoEngage dashboard.

Navigate to Create Segment in the MoEngage dashboard and search for the users by ID, Email, Mobile Number, or MoEngage Id. This search provides the list of users, matching the search text with the provided fields. Clicking on any of the rows will open the user profile.
Navigate to Create Segment in the MoEngage dashboard. Segment users based on the desired criteria. Query results are shown in the Recent Query section; click on any of the circles in the Sample User section of a query result to open up the user profile for the respective user.
info	

Information

Any query in the user profile is performed using the server time, and the query result displays the event time.
Event time is displayed in the User Profile and not the server time.

For more information, refer to Event Time and Server Time.

User Identification

The first section shows the introductory information about the user. This section has the First Name, Last Name, Email Id, Mobile Number, MoEngage ID, and ID of the user. It also shows if the user is registered or not.

All of these details of a user are categorized into two primary sections - User Info and User Activity.

User Info

The user info section consists of all the information about the user and user properties.

Basic Info

Basic information about the user derived by MoEngage, is listed first in the User Info section and consists of Lifecycle, Conversion, Acquisition, and Location information.

Reachability

Reachability shows whether the user can be reached/connected through various channels like push, email, and SMS. The green tick mark on the Push card shows at least one platform or device on which this user is reachable. The red exclamation mark represents the user is not reachable on the respective platform or channel.

Use Test Push, Test Email, and Test SMS buttons to quickly send the test notification to the user. Test Push and Test Email send a preconfigured Push and Email, respectively. Test SMS requires the user to fill in the text message, as laws in a few countries (i.e. India) require whitelisted text to send the SMS.

Know more about reachability here.

User Attributes

All user attributes wrt the user are listed in this section. These attributes are present in the User Properties dropdown while segmenting the users. These user properties are grouped into respective categories. The 'mo' symbol in front of the user attributes represents that the respective user attributes are derived/generated by MoEngage.

To perform a quick search for any user property, hover over a user property & click on the COPY button to copy the attribute value. Click the Download button to download all user attributes in a CSV file.

The list of all user properties and related information can be found here.

User Activity

User activity shows all the events and event attributes performed by the user, sorted by the event execution time. The default view shows the event list sorted in the Latest First order with the event attributes collapsed, which enables the quick view.

Filters

User activity can be filtered on various parameters to analyze desired events and sections of the user profile. The filters are:

Date Range Filters
Platform Filters
Event or Campaign Filters

These filters can be combined to have the desired view of the user profile.

 

Event Filters
User activity can be filtered for up to 5 events. Any event and respective attributes present in the account can be used to filter the user activity. This is very similar to filtering user activity present in segmentation.

Campaign Filters
Campaign activities for a user can be quickly filtered out using the Campaign filters, and respective campaigns such as Email, Push, SMS, etc., or All Campaigns can be viewed. It filters out the respective campaign events performed by the user.

Usability Features

With the user activity page, multiple usability features have been included. These features are explained below - 

The activity timeline can be sorted on Latest First or Oldest First Order. Your preference is saved on your device.

User Merging

All users are identified using a unique attribute such as email, mobile number, custom id, etc. These identifiers are generated when users provide information about themselves, such as when they log in with an email id, mobile number, or username. In addition, users may visit your app or website using multiple devices, and until the user logs in, we will not know if this user is new or existing.

MoEngage classifies users as:

Anonymous User - A user who hasn’t been identified yet by the website or the app. This could be a user who has been using the app/website but hasn’t logged in or a completely new user who hasn’t signed up.
Registered User - A user who has signed up or logged in to your website or app.
Terms to Know
MoEngage ID - MoEngage creates a unique identifier as soon as a user visits your website or app to recognize a user, which is a non-changeable value.
ID - When a user registers on your app or website (by providing a form of email, phone number, or user id), we recommend you generate a unique identifier for that profile and pass it to MoEngage as an ID. This ID lets you recognize the user across multiple devices and platforms, thus providing a 360° view. This ensures that information about the user is captured correctly even if they uninstall and reinstall the app.
MoEngage ID and ID - Relationship
New User - When a user opens or visits the app for the first time, neither the brand nor MoEngage has any information about them. MoEngage assigns a MoEngageID to this user and creates an anonymous profile for them. MoEngage records all actions that the user performs.
Sign-up -If the user proceeds to sign up, they become a registered user or an identified user. The brand assigns a unique identifier for each user called ID. This information is passed to MoEngage, and this user is now considered a registered user in the MoEngage system.
Registered user who hasn’t signed in initially - If the user has an account (has a MoEngage ID and an ID) but signs in after performing a series of events, a new MoEngage ID would have been created for them as they hadn’t signed in initially. Once they sign in,  the user profile created earlier with a new MoEngage ID is merged with this existing MoEngage ID.
User Merging Scenarios

MoEngage enables you to have a single user ID for all your users, even if they are using different devices. The only condition for merging users in MoEngage is that the user has to be signed in on the device. When a user visits your website or app, MoEngage merges the anonymous user profile with the registered user profile once they log in to the system. For more information on enabling user merging, refer to Enable User Merging.

Scenario 1: When the user visits your website or app for the first time on a device (Device 1), then they are user called an anonymous user, and a MoEngageID is set as MoEID-1 for that user.
If the user logs in, this user is an identified user and an ID called U-1 is set for the user. All events on this device, until the user logs out or uninstalls, are attributed to MoEID-1.

 

Scenario 2: If the same user visits the website/app from another device (Device 2), then this user is still an anonymous user since MoEngage does not know the identity of this user, and a new MoEngageID MoEID2 is created for the user. If the user logs in, the website or app notifies MoEngage that the user ID is U-1. Now, the anonymous user is merged with the already existing registered user.

Merging Impact on User Attributes

A retained user is a previously identified/registered user. The anonymous user gets merged into the identified/registered user.

Here's what happens during user merging:

The 'First Seen' attribute of the retained user is kept.
The values of LTV, No. of Conversion, and No. of Sessions attributes get added from both profiles and are stored in the retained profile.
The attributes present in the retained user will be kept as is and will not be modified.
The attributes that are not present in the retained user and present in the anonymous user will be copied to the retained user.
Push Reachability calculation is done based on the overall devices.
If the 'Email (Standard)' attribute is copied to the retained user, email suppression attributes (Hard Bounce, Spam, Unsubscribed) are also copied.
Merging Impact on Events

All the events occurring after the user merge are attributed to the identified/registered user. All events performed before are also attributed to the identified/registered user."

Unified Identity (Identity Resolution)
 	

Early Access

This is an Early Access feature. To enable it for your account, contact your CSM or raise a support ticket.

Overview

Unified Identity involves linking and matching an individual's attributes from different data sources to create a unified identity representation. It combines various data elements to establish connections and create a comprehensive view of the user. Resolving these users into a single user profile enables marketers to accurately segment and personalize the users based on the data collected across various online and offline resources and avoid duplication.
The Identity Resolution feature of MoEngage allows you to integrate multiple profiles of the same user using different identifier attributes (such as ID, EmailID, Mobile Number, etc.) obtained from various online and offline data sources (ingested into MoEngage via Data APIs, MoEngage SDKs, and CSV files). When multiple sources include clear identity information, such as a customer ID, email ID, or phone number, you can utilize these attributes as identifiers to build a single unified customer profile in MoEngage. This maintains a single source of truth for each user, allowing you to seamlessly track their behavior on your application and set your business strategies accordingly.

info	

Info

To use identity resolution, you must choose an existing user attribute as an identifier (like a phone number or email ID) that uniquely identifies the user as an Identifier.

Use Cases

Identity resolution plays a critical role in the following scenarios:

A user browses a public listing page on a brand's website, providing their email ID (tracked as Email ID attribute in MoEngage) and phone number (tracked as Mobile Number (standard) user attribute in MoEngage). While buying a product at the brand offline store, the same user uses their phone number to complete their purchase. The brand aims to link the browsing activity on the website to the user who purchased at the store using their phone number.
A brand offers multiple user registration methods such as email login, mobile OTP, and social media logins like Facebook. However, these methods generate different user profiles for the same individual. The brand aims to consolidate these multiple profiles into a single unified profile as it gathers additional information when the user engages in further activities.
Configure Multiple Identifiers

The first step in using Identity resolution is to activate the right set of user attributes as identifiers. You can configure up to five identifiers at a workspace level. The standard user attribute ID is set as the default identifier. You can opt to configure other user attributes, such as email and mobile number, as additional identifiers. Note that at least one identifier must be active at any given time.

For example, if you choose email ID and mobile number as identifiers, MoEngage checks the email ID and mobile number for all users. In cases where multiple users share the same mobile number but have distinct email IDs, the system consolidates those users into a single profile as one of the identifier values matches successfully.

When comparing user profiles, if there are conflicting values, the system will prioritize and consider the values from the user profiles with the latest last-seen timestamp (by default behavior that can be changed) during the merging process. This prioritized profile is called the retained profile, and the de-prioritized profile is called the merged profile. The merged profile is deleted after the events and user attributes are transferred to the retained profile.

Perform the following steps to configure multiple identifiers in the MoEngage dashboard (Only Admins can view and access Identity resolution):

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, go to Settings > Data > Identity resolution.
On the Identity resolution page, click +Add identifier(s). You can add up to five identifiers for identity resolution.

By default, ID is listed as an identifier for merging user profiles using identity resolution. The Active tag represents the identifier currently used for identity resolution for merging users in your current workspace.
All the identifiers added are listed on this page. Click the ellipsis icon () to perform the following:
Pause identity resolution: This option allows you to pause merging the user based on that identifier.
 
View/Edit exceptions: This option allows you to view or edit exceptions of that identifier. In the View/Edit exception dialog box, select the exception from the list and click Save.

The Merge settings option takes you to Step 2: Review merge rules.
On the Add identifier(s) page, you can perform the following steps:
Step 1: Select Identifiers

Select the checkbox next to the User attributes you want to select as identifiers for identity resolution.
You can view the Description for each attribute.
Exceptions: MoEngage does not ingest user attributes with exceptional values detected in their Identifier user attributes. As identifiers are used to uniquely identify users, values that do not achieve this distinctiveness, such as null and blanks, are excluded from the system. These values are set as exceptions by default and cannot be edited or removed. You can add additional exceptions, provided they are in string format.
You can view the various Data sources from which these identifiers are obtained. If an identifier is collected from multiple data sources, selecting that identifier for identity resolution is advantageous. This approach enhances the reliability of the identity-matching process across various channels.
The Tracked data types denote the various data types for which the data for that attribute has been tracked in MoEngage so far.

info	

Information

User attributes of type String are supported to be activated as identifiers.
User attributes of any other data type selected as identifiers are converted to String for existing data and incoming data. 
Click Next.
Step 2: Review Merge Rules
Profile retention rules: This rule decides which user profile should be the retained profile. Perform the following steps to add profile retention rules:
In the Rule 1 list, select a user attribute. The user profile containing any data for the selected user attribute will be considered as the retained profile. If Rule 1 is validated successfully, the retained profile is selected based on Rule 1. If Rule 1 fails to break the tie in cases where both users to be merged have data points for the selected user attribute, Rule 2 will be used. Rule 1 is an optional rule and by default is empty.
In the Rule 2 list, select a user behavior. Based on the selected user behavior, the user profile containing that behavior is considered a retained profile. By default, Latest Last Seen is auto-populated and used to select the retained user profile. Note that Rule 2 is executed only if Rule 1 fails.
For example, consider you have two customer profiles for the same user in which Profile 1 is received online, and Profile 2 is received offline.
Scenario 1: The profile with data in the selected attribute is considered a retained profile.
Profile 1 has attributes such as ID, name, email ID, and mobile number. All these attributes contain data.
Profile 2 has attributes such as ID, name, email ID, and mobile number. All attributes contain data except for ID.
If the attributes received online (Profile 1) are more accurate than offline (Profile 2) and you want Profile 1 to be considered a retained profile, select ID in the Rule 1 list. During merging, the system selects the profile that contains data for the ID attribute. Here, Profile 1 has data for ID, so it will considered as the retained profile.
Scenario 2: When both the profiles have data in the selected attribute, Rule 1 fails, and Rule 2 is validated.
Profile 1 has attributes such as ID, name, email ID, mobile number, and first seen. All these attributes contain data.
Profile 2 has attributes such as ID, name, email ID, and mobile number, and first seen. All these attributes contain data.
If you select ID in the Rule 1 list, Rule 1 fails as both Profile 1 and Profile 2 contain data for ID. So, Rule 2 gets validated.
If you select Latest last seen in the Rule 2 list, the profile containing the latest last seen is considered a retained profile.

Attribute rules: This rule allows you to merge the data of your custom user attributes. Note that you can add a maximum of five attribute rules. By default, LTV (one of the MoEngage derived user attribute) is shown as an example where MoEngage takes the sum of LTV values of the 2 user profiles getting merged, the final resolved user profile will have the total sum of the LTV value of both the retained user and the merged user. Perform the following steps to add your own custom user attribute rules:
Click Add rule.
Select User attributes and Merge rules.
For example, consider you have two customer profiles for the same user in which Profile 1 is received online, and Profile 2 is received offline. Each profile has a Loyalty_points attribute and has data in it, and if you want the SUM of both Loyalty_points when both these profiles are merged, perform the following:
Select Loyalty_points in User attribute list.
Select Sum of values in Merge rules list.
So, whenever user profiles are merged, the resulting unified profile includes the Loyalty_points attribute, which comprises the combined sum of the Loyalty_points data from both profiles.

The Verify merge section shows how users are merged based on the profile retention and attribute rules you configured. Select I have verified all merge scenarios checkbox after verifying the merge scenarios.

Click Next.
Step 3: Activate Identity Resolution

This step provides the instructions to be considered before and after activating the identity resolution.

Irreversible changes to be considered before activating Identity resolution. The changes include:

A user merged cannot be unmerged.
For 48 hours after activation, the following actions are not possible on the Identity resolution page:
Adding new identifiers
Pausing, re-activating, and adding exceptions to existing identifiers
Changing Merge settings

After activating identity resolution:

Existing users in the workspace merge over 48 hours
New incoming users merge with existing users based on profile retention rules
Upto 50 existing users in your workspace with the same identifier value will be merged successfully - rest will remain un-merged. This does not apply for new incoming users who will be successfully merged with existing user on the basis of configured merge rules.

Following are the methods by which you can ingest data into MoEngage using multiple identifiers:

Data APIs
SDK
File Imports
Data APIs:

In MoEngage, data ingestion uses an ID to create or update a user. For workspaces in MoEngage with Identity Resolution enabled, Data APIs (Track User, Create Event, Bulk Import) can be used to create or update users using a specific identifier, such as a mobile number or email ID, as configured.

You can:

Create users through Server-to-Server Data APIs even when they do not have an ID (but have other identifiers).
Create a user or track events of a user when identifiers other than ID (for example, email ID or phone number) are known.
Request Body

The following is a sample cURL request for a Bulk Import API consisting of the following payloads:

User payload:  Attribute parameters must contain at least one of the identifiers you have configured based on which users in MoEngage will be created, updated, or merged.
Event payload: Identifiers set up in the workspace must be mentioned within the user_identifiers parameter, as shown in the below example where moe_mobile is one of the identifiers in the workspace:

SDK

Supported SDKs where Identity resolution changes are available:

Android (13.6.00)
iOS (9.23.0)
WebSDK (2.52.2)
GTM
AMP
ReactNative
Flutter

identifyUser() function is introduced in the new SDK versions that are compatible with Identity resolution. This function is a direct replacement of the SetUniqueID function and allows you to track users with multiple identifier attributes. Make sure to configure these identifiers in MoEngage before IdentifyUser function is implemented.

The following are examples of SDK sample codes where email and id are set as identifiers in a given workspace.

	    )

	)
info	

Information

Updates are made to SDK functions to improve user identification and session management.

Forced Logout: The MoEngage SDK no longer automatically logs out the previous user when a new user is detected on the device. Logout should now be explicitly called for workspaces enabled with Identity resolution to avoid data corruption.
SetUniqueID: IdentifyUser function supports multiple identifiers, which replaces the need of using SetUniqueID function for user identification. Note that SetUniqueID is marked for removal in the future releases of SDK versions - it is important to use identifyUser instead especially if you are using Identity resolution in your workspace.
SetAlias: For workspaces with the Identity resolution feature enabled, MoEngage SDK stores the previous identifier values. When IdentifyUser function is used to track the new identifier values, MoEngage SDK detects the change in identifier value and reports accordingly.
File Imports

You can view the multiple identifiers configured for your workspace in the following sections:

User Imports in Segment
If you have configured multiple identifiers for a given workspace, you can see them in the Map identifiers section in Step 2 while creating new user imports. You can only see ID under the Map identifiers section if multiple identifiers are not configured in this workspace. 


info	

Information

The uploaded CSV must have at least one column with data matching any identifiers configured in MoEngage.
After activating your identifiers in the workspace, please edit your existing periodic imports to map the identifiers to the right CSV column.
For Anonymous user import, when the multiple identifiers feature is enabled for a MoEngage workspace and if an identifier user attribute is selected as an anonymous ID, the users from the import may merge with the existing users having the same identifier value. For example, if you have configured an email ID as an identifier and, while mapping identifiers, you choose an email ID as the anonymous ID, there is a chance that users from the import may merge with other users having the same email ID.

Data Imports in Data
While creating a new user data import, if you have configured multiple identifiers for a given workspace, you can see them in the Map identifiers section while creating new user imports. You can only see ID under the Map identifiers section if multiple identifiers are not configured in this workspace. 
If you have configured multiple identifiers for a given workspace while creating a new event data import, you can see them in Step 2: Import configuration and action under the Map identifiers section while creating new event imports. If multiple identifiers are not configured in this workspace, you can only see ID and Event time under the Map identifiers section.


info	

Information

 

The uploaded CSV must have at least one column with data matching any identifiers configured in MoEngage.

 
While creating new auxiliary data imports 
In Step 2: Import configuration and action, when you turn on the Update user profile attributes (optional) toggle, you can view the multiple identifiers for that workspace in the Map identifiers section. You can only see ID under the Map identifiers section if multiple identifiers are not configured in this workspace.

Impact of Merging Users

The following are the effects of user merging on various campaigns and channels:

On Data
User attribute info: When merged, all user attribute information of the retained user is retained. If user attributes in merged users do not exist in retained users, those attributes are transferred to the retained user profile.
info	

Info

Important contact information may be lost. For example, if two users are merged based on the same mobile number but have different Email-ids - the retained user’s EmailID information will be retained and the merged user’s EmailId information will be lost. Please setup Profile retention rules to help select the right retained user profile.

Device info: When merged, all devices are merged into the retained user, and no device information is lost.
Events info: All events of the merged user are transferred to the retained user, hence no events are lost during a user-merge. The resolved user will have events of all the merged users.
Other data callouts: Users cannot be un-merged after merging. Be careful when configuring identifiers for your workspace.
On Segment
Active segments: When users are merged, the total number of users in active segments may decrease because users are merged into a single profile.
Custom segments: Whenever the custom segment is updated, the user count may change.
On Campaign
User merging may impact the overall reachability number. When merged, the contact details of the merged user will be lost, and hence, a campaign’s overall reachability may be reduced. This also impacts the overall campaign stats.
Only Data APIs (TrackUser, CreateEvent, BulkImport API) support tracking users with multiple identifiers. Other APIs in MoEngage may still require ID at the moment.
Reachability Impact
Channel	Reachability Attribute	Merge Outcome
Email	Hard bounce	

If multiple users getting merged have the same email ID but conflicting hard bounce values, the outcome will be hard Bounce = true.

If users getting merged have different email IDs, the retained user’s email preferences will remain post-merge.


Spam	

If multiple users getting merged have the same email ID but with conflicting Spam statuses, the outcome will be Spam = true.

If multiple users getting merged have different email IDs, the retained user’s Spam status will be retained.


Unsubscribe	

If multiple users getting merged have the same email ID but with conflicting Spam statuses, the outcome will be Unsubscribe = true.

If multiple users are getting merged and have different email values, the retained user’s Unsubscribe status will be retained.


Subscription Categories	Subscription categories of retained users will be retained.
Push	Reachability push status code (iOS, Android, Web)	

When users are merged, all devices will be added to the retained user.

Final Reachability will be derived based on all devices present with the retained user.


SMS	Subscription status	Retained user’s mobile number preferences will be retained.
WhatsApp	Subscription status	Retained user’s mobile number preferences will be retained.

User Data
User Install Status

Install status indicates whether an application is installed or not for a particular user, providing base-level install information at a user level.

Track Install Status

MoEngage tracks the install status in multiple ways:

By setting up Install/Uninstall/Reinstall tracking through SDK integration
By observing when silent push messages, sent to users' devices, return a signal from Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) indicating whether the app is installed or not. Note that a silent push notification is not supported in Apple devices any longer. You can activate this tracking from the dashboard settings page. 
By setting up Firebase integration in MoEngage SDK for real-time uninstall tracking.

If MoEngage detects that a user has installed the app, the install status is marked as true; otherwise, it is marked as false. For users with multiple devices, the install status will be true, if the user has at least one installed device.

View Install Status in MoEngage Dashboard

Follow the below steps to view the install status of a particular user in the MoEngage dashboard:

Log in to the MoEngage dashboard and navigate to Segments > Create Segments.
Under Query results, expand the desired query.
Under Sample users of the query, click the required user for which you want to view the install status. You can also search for the user directly using the search bar in Create segment UI.

In the following User Profile page that appears, under the Uninstall section you can view the Install Status.

Factors Causing Inaccuracies in Install Status

There are certain factors that can cause inaccuracies in the install status tracking:

Inaccurate feedback details - The silent push messages are typically tracked by feedback services of notification providers such as APNS and FCM. These feedback services usually notify applications when push messages cannot be delivered, also known as push bounce, which indicates that the customer has uninstalled your application. It’s nearly impossible to know exactly when a user uninstalls because feedback is only generated when apps attempt to deliver push messages.
Depreciation of silent push notifications for IOS 10- The deprecation of silent push notifications in iOS 10 poses challenges for tracking uninstalls at the user level. Silent push notifications were previously used to detect when a user had uninstalled an app, as the feedback would indicate delivery failure. However, with their deprecation, it has become increasingly difficult to precisely track uninstalls.
User logout before uninstalling- When a user logs out before uninstalling an app, it can lead to inaccurate uninstall tracking. This occurs because the app remains installed on the device even though the user may no longer actively use it. Uninstall tracking typically relies on feedback from push notification services that inform the app when messages cannot be delivered due to an app being uninstalled. However, if the user logs out without uninstalling, the app continues to receive push notifications, making it difficult to differentiate between an actual uninstall and a logged-out session.
Device archival- Uninstall tracking can be inaccurate when the device is archived because the install status of a user is retained for up to 60 days even after archiving. When a device is archived, it means that it is no longer actively used or connected to the user's account. However, the uninstall tracking mechanism may not recognise the archived status and may continue to retain the user's install status as TRUE. This leads to inaccurate uninstall tracking as the user may have actually uninstalled the app but is still considered as having an active installation.

It's important to consider these limitations when analyzing the install status and interpreting user engagement and retention metrics accurately."

This includes delivering targeted messages, recommendations, and offers based on specific user actions, leading to improved engagement and conversion rates.
Optimized Campaigns: Event tracking allows marketers to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and initiatives by tracking key conversion events and attributing them to specific marketing channels or campaigns. This enables marketers to optimize their campaigns in real-time and allocate resources more effectively.
Enhanced User Experience: Understanding user behavior through event tracking helps businesses identify pain points, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement within their digital properties. By optimizing the user experience based on these insights, businesses can increase user satisfaction and loyalty.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Event tracking provides businesses with valuable data and analytics that can inform data-driven decision-making processes. By analyzing event data, businesses can identify opportunities for growth, innovation, and strategic planning, leading to better business outcomes.

In summary, event tracking is an essential tool for marketers and businesses looking to gain deeper insights into user behavior, personalize user experiences, optimize marketing efforts, and make data-driven decisions to drive business success in the digital age.

 
Understanding the Events

Data 
Event Data
Event Time and Received Time
Introduction

MoEngage stores all the time data in UTC time (Except the event). MoEngage queries your action & user analysis on the UTC time using the time zone offset of your App time zone. MoEngage collects Event Time and Server Time.

Event Time

Event Time is the time on the device when the event was performed. Event Time is displayed in the User Profile. For more information, refer to User Profile.

For events that are not generated at the device (MoEngage generated events) or events that don't have device time (Data API events), the event time is recorded in the User Timezone. If it is unavailable, then the App timezone is shown. If neither is available, then UTC time is taken as the Event Time.



Received Time (Server Time)

Whenever an event is received on the MoEngage servers from the device, the time is set as the Event Received Time (or Server Time).

For events that are not generated at the device (MoEngage generated events and Data API events) the Received Time is the App time zone in the user profile.

All Segmentation and Analytics queries use Received Time for the event time range selection.

 

In User Profile for all events, there is Event Time (time at which the event is performed) and Event Received time (time at which the event is received at MoEngage).

Difference between Event Time and Receive Time

Event Time and Event Receive Time (Server Time) are generally the same or might have a difference of a few seconds. But at times, Event Time and Server Time are not the same and the time differences are higher. The reasons are:

Data reaches the MoEngage server with a delay - The events do not reach to MoEngage servers in time due to Internet issues, App crashes, App removal from memory (especially with Chinese OEMs), etc.
Event Time is not accurate - Device time is not accurate which leads to inaccurate event time.

The high time difference between Event Time and Server Time provides a slightly deviated analysis for very few users. For these users, the segmentation, analytics, and user profile results might have slightly deviated. The impact is less than 0.5% of the user events.

There is no impact on the campaign analysis in the campaign detail pages and the campaign stats dashboard."

Data 
Imports 
Overview
Overview - Imports
Introduction

MoEngage allows customers to import users and events through files stored in various sources like S3 Buckets and SFTP servers as well as directly from tables in your data warehouses. MoEngage Dashboard enables you to configure multiple imports directly by defining file locations, configuring one or more than one file import sources, and import methods.

Supported Sources

MoEngage currently supports importing files from:

Amazon S3 Buckets
SFTP Servers

MoEngage also supports importing from data warehouses:

Snowflake Imports
Types of Imports

MoEngage can import the following from your sources:

Registered Users: These are users who are already registered on MoEngage. You can also use this type of import to update existing users in bulk.
Anonymous Users: These are users who still need to be registered on MoEngage.
Events (Standard and User Defined): MoEngage can import standard events like Campaign Interaction Events as well as your own user-defined events.
Auxiliary Data: There are user data temporarily ingested into MoEngage for specific business purposes.
info	

Information

If your system requires IP whitelisting, refer to this document here before setting up the data import.

Preparing the files

Before configuring the imports on the MoEngage dashboard, make sure that all your files are in the expected format and within the sanctioned limits.

Supported File Types

We only support CSV files (in UTF-8 file encoding) as of now.

Naming Conventions

The file name is made up of two parts: <import type>_<date time format>.csv. The final name will depend on the type of import and the date-time format you pick.

Import Type
Registered Users
File names should start with the prefix registered_user_data_
Example: registered_user_data_01311997.csv
Anonymous Users
File names should start with the prefix anonymous_user_data_
Example: anonymous_user_data_jan_2022.csv
Events
File names should start with the prefix <event name>_
In certain cases, Event Name and Event Display Name can be different. You can manage your events by going to the Data Management page in MoEngage.
For example, if the event name is ""Purchase Summary"": Purchase Summary_31011997.csv
For example, if the event name is ""Purchase_Transaction"": Purchase_Transaction_19970131_1259.csv
info	

Note

You can not use ""moe_"" as a prefix while naming events, event attributes, or user attributes. It is a system prefix and using it might result in periodic blacklisting without prior communication.
 
Date Time Format

Your file names should end with the suffix <date time format>.csv. This ""date-time"" represents the day on which the import runs. For example, if the import runs on ""7th January 2022"", and the selected date-time format is ddmmyyyy, we will look for all the files that end with the suffix 07012022.csv.

We support multiple date-time formats:

Type

	

Description

	

Example




{mm}_{yyyy}

	

mm: Month from 01 to 12

yyyy: 4-digit year

	

12_2022




{ddmmyyyy}

	

dd: Days from 01 to 31

mm: Month from 01 to 12

yyyy: 4-digit year

	

31012022




{yyyymmdd}

	

yyyy: 4-digit year

mm: Month from 01 to 12

dd: Days from 01 to 31

	

20220112




{mon_yyyy}

	

mon: 3-letter abbreviation of the month from jan to dec (in lowercase)

yyyy: 4-digit year

	

jan_2022




{yyyymmdd}_{hhmm}

	

yyyy: 4-digit year

mm: Month from 01 to 12

dd: Days from 01 to 31

hh: 2-digit hours from 00 to 23

mm: 2-digit minutes from 00 to 59

	

20220131_1259

You can configure the date time formats for the file names on the MoEngage dashboard while setting up the import.

info	

Note

We also support custom filenames, as long as the following naming convention is followed:

Naming Convention: <custom name>_<date time format>.csv

Filenames should have the custom prefix name and date-time format separated by ""_"". The custom name should consist of alphabets, numerals, space, and ""_"".

For Example: abc_31012024.csv

Valid File Name Examples

Few examples of valid file names:

Registered Users Import with date time format {yyyymmdd}_{hhmm} will have file names like registered_user_data_20220131_1259.csv
Anonymous Users Import with date time format {mon_yyyy} will have file names like anonymous_user_data_feb_2022.csv
""Item Purchased"" event import with date time format {ddmmyyyy} will have file names like Item Purchased_31012022.csv
Array Support
Simple arrays are supported. Nested and Associated arrays are not supported.
The supported delimiter in the CSV is ""|"".
The supported data types are array double (numeric) and array string. You can select these data types in the list under the Map column to attribute column of the Map columns section while executing Step 2: Import configuration and action.


All the elements in the array have to be homogenous, which means they must be either integer or string. If they are not homogenous, MoEngage tries to typecast (transform) the element and then store the data. Following is the example of an array in a CSV field: [1|2|3]

Array Typecasting: If an array has elements [“1” | 2 | “abc”] of multiple datatypes and the defined datatype is Array Integer, then the final array ingested in MoEngage is [ 1, 2 ]. In this case, “abc” was a string that cannot be transformed into integer and hence not ingested into MoEngage in the final array. For more information on typecasting in MoEngage, refer here.

File Structure

We support CSV files only. Here are some rules that your files need to adhere to:

The first row of your file needs to be the column names. MoEngage will always treat the first row of your file as the header row.
Please ensure there are no duplicate column names in your file. Do note that column names are case-sensitive.
Please ensure there are no missing column names.
Avoid empty rows (either the row is blank, or all the columns in that row are blank).

MoEngage will recognize the first row of your files as the header file and parse the column names. You can then map them to MoEngage Attributes on the MoEngage Dashboard or choose to upload a manifest file.

For each type of import, we require you to have a column that can be mapped to a mandatory attribute:

Registered Users Import: Your files should have a column that can be mapped to the user ID (user identifier to identify User Profile in MoEngage).
Anonymous Users Import: Your files should have a column (email, mobile, etc) that can be mapped to an anonymous ID. An anonymous ID such as email, mobile, etc can help you identify users who have used your app/website but have not yet signed up.
Event Import: Your files should have a column that can be mapped to Event Time and a column that can be mapped to the user ID (user identifier to identify User Profile in MoEngage).

Here are some sample files:

Import Registered Users Sample File
Import Anonymous Users Sample File
Import Events Sample File
Sample Manifest/Mapping File
Manifest Files

Using the MoEngage Dashboard, you can map the columns in your CSV files to attributes inside MoEngage. Or optionally, you can also choose to upload a manifest file.

A manifest file contains mappings between the source column and a MoEngage Attribute. It also contains the data type of the column. This file needs to be in JSON format.

An example of a manifest file is shown below:

Sample Manifest File:
Light
Dark
content_copy

	{

	  ""mapping"": [

	    {

	      ""column"": ""ID"",

	      ""type"": ""bool"",

	      ""is_skipped"": false

	    }

	  ]

	}

For each column, you need to mention the following fields:

“column”: (required) Represents the column name from the source file. 
“moe_attr”: (required) The MoEngage Attribute (attribute name) to which you want to map the source file column. You can view the number of Events, User Attributes, Volume of User and Events  on the Data Management page. Ensure each column is mapped to a unique ""moe_attr"".
“type”:  (optional) This field represents the data type of the column. Refer to the table below for the acceptable ""type"" formats for attributes. Refer to the Data Management page for more information.
“datetime_format”: (optional) This field indicates the date and time format. It is mandatory for DateTime fields only. Refer to the table below for the complete list of supported date-time formats.
“is_skipped”: (optional) This field represents whether MoEngage should import the column or not. It is a boolean field, and any attribute marked as true will be skipped during import.

The above sample manifest file consists of 5 standard attributes. You can refer to the below list for more such standard attributes or refer to your Data Management dashboard to get the exhaustive standard attribute list. 

Some other standard user attributes in MoEngage for reference:
Key	Attribute Name on Dashboard	Datatype	Description

Note

The values mentioned above are the default limits. If your requirement exceeds these limits, you can get in touch with MoEngage to increase the same.
The default hourly rate indicates the total data that can be ingested in an hour and does not indicate the total data limit for the day. The Default Daily limit is the total cap on the data that can be ingested in a day, as indicated in the table above.
For one-time historical imports, get in touch with the support team to guide you.
When the rate limits for the imports are breached, you will receive a Rate limit breached alert in the Segment-> Imports section on the MoEngage Dashboard.
Best Practices

To ensure your data imports run smoothly and efficiently, consider the following recommendations:

Optimize File Size for Speed: For faster processing, it's recommended to keep individual import files under 1 million rows.
Split Large Datasets: If you have a large amount of data to import, splitting it into multiple smaller files will generally result in faster overall processing than uploading a single, huge file.

Data 
Imports 
Data Warehouses Imports
Databricks Imports
Overview

MoEngage allows you to import users and events through tables in your Databricks databases.

Types of Imports

MoEngage supports the following types of imports from your Databricks data warehouse:

Registered Users: Users who are already registered on MoEngage.
Anonymous Users: Users who are not yet registered on MoEngage.
Events (standard and user-defined): MoEngage can import standard events like campaign interaction events and your user-defined events.
Prepare the Data

MoEngage does not require a specific table schema for imports; all columns in the table can be skipped or mapped individually on the MoEngage dashboard. However, certain considerations must be addressed before configuring the imports.

User Imports
Event Imports
When users configure periodic User Imports on MoEngage, MoEngage syncs data that has been changed since the last synchronization by referencing the updated_at timestamp column. You can assign any name to this column as long as it accurately reflects the time of the data modification. If you're assigning this column by a different name in your table, you can configure this mapping separately on the MoEngage dashboard.

To import standard MoEngage events, ensure that the event names in your table align with MoEngage standard event names.

Required Access Permissions

MoEngage requires READ access to your database so that we can fetch data into MoEngage. You can grant the following permissions to an existing database user or create a new dedicated database user for MoEngage:

Query 1 (Required)

 -- Grant SELECT permission on all tables in the schema GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA `catalog_name`.`schema_name` TO `user@example.com`;

The query above grants the SELECT permission on all tables within the schema schema_name in the catalog  catalog_name to the user with the email user@example.com.

Granting the SELECT permission enables MoEngage to perform the following actions within the schema:

Read data from all tables within the schema.
Execute SELECT queries on any table.
View the contents of tables without the permission to modify the underlying data.
Query 2 (Required)

 -- GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA `catalog_name`.`schema_name` TO `user@example.com`;

The query above grants the USE SCHEMA permission on all tables within the schema schema_name in the catalog  catalog_name to the user with the email user@example.com.

The USE SCHEMA permission grants a user the ability to:

Access and view the schema's metadata.
Set the schema as their active working context (for example, using  USE
    SCHEMA).
View the schema in schema listings.
Utilize the schema name when referring to fully-qualified object names.

When you use both Query 1 and Query 2, the permissions function as follows:

USE SCHEMA: This permission is required to access and reference the specified schema.
SELECT: This permission allows data to be read from tables within that schema.
Without the USE SCHEMA permission, a user cannot access the schema, even if they have SELECT permissions on its tables. Query 2 explicitly grants the USE SCHEMA permission to enable schema access.

In all the queries provided, ensure you replace the following placeholder values with your specific details:

<catalog_name>: The name of your catalog.
<schema_name>: The name of your database/schema.
<user@example.com>: The email ID of the user who created the token.
Import Datetype Attributes

Importing Datetype attributes requires additional steps. For more information, refer here.

Set Up Imports from Databricks
info	

Prerequisites

Ensure you have an existing Databricks connection setup in the MoEngage App Marketplace with relevant permissions.
If your security policies require you to whitelist our IPs, you can refer to here.
Support for Object Data Type needs to be enabled for your account - Optional.

To set up Databricks Imports, perform the following steps:

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Data > Data imports.
On the Data imports page, click Data warehouses.
Click + Import in the upper-right corner and select Users or Events to create a new import.

Click the Databricks tile.
Click Continue.

Step 1: Select Your Databricks Connection and Table Source
Import Name

Enter a name for this import to identify it on the Imports Dashboard easily. Based on the type of import selected, your next steps might vary:

User Imports
Events Imports
You can now select whether to import Registered users or Anonymous users. You can also choose to import both together:

Import Source

In this first step, Source and format, you must specify MoEngage, which Databricks connection to use, and the table from which to import. To get started, perform the following steps:

In the Databricks connection list, select a connection to use for this Import.
If you have not already created a Databricks connection, click + Add connection at the end of the Databricks connection list, and you will be redirected to the App Marketplace to set it up. You can learn more about connecting your Databricks warehouse to MoEngage here.
After you have selected your Databricks connection, the Schema/Dataset and Table/View lists are displayed.
In the Schema/Dataset, select the schema/dataset.
Note: Ensure that MoEngage has been granted the necessary permissions detailed in the Prerequisites if your schemas are loading incorrectly.

In the Table/View list, select table/view to import data from. 

Event Imports

In addition to the above steps, MoEngage provides additional support for tables containing multiple events. If your table contains multiple events, you must first Preview the table and then select the Table contains multiple events check box.

MoEngage uses the values of the Event name column to filter out rows that need to be imported. It imports only those rows that match the selected event name. You can designate an existing column in your table as the event name column. After selecting this column and previewing the data again, filtered rows are displayed for your review before proceeding with the import:

After you preview your table, you will move to the second step, Import configuration and action.

Step 2: Map Your Columns to MoEngage Attributes

In this step, you need to map the columns of your table to the attributes present in MoEngage. All your columns are shown one below the other:

Column name: This specifies the column name to be mapped. Below the column name, MoEngage also displays a sample value (picked from the first row of the fetched table in the previous step) for your reference.
Map attribute: This specifies the MoEngage attribute you want to map the table column to. You can also choose to create a new attribute. Some attributes support ingestion from multiple data types, so you need to pick the column's data type as well. For the datetime columns, you must pick the format. For more information, refer here.
Action: You can optionally choose to skip the column. The skipped column will not be imported.

Depending on the type of import, there are a few mandatory mappings required:

arrow_drop_down
User Imports
arrow_drop_down
Event Imports

After a mandatory mapping is marked, it will reflect against the column name in the mapping table, and you can no longer mark the column as skippable.

Just like new events, you can also create a new user attribute. To do so:

Click + Create attribute available in the Select attribute list. The Create new attribute dialog box is displayed.

In the Attribute name box, type a name for your attribute.
In the Data type list, select a data type. You can edit this and existing attributes from the Data Management page. 
info	

Information

The newly created user attributes will not appear on the Data Management page until the initial import is successful.

 

Manifest Files

Optionally, you can choose to auto-map these columns by uploading a Manifest file. To upload a manifest file:

Click the Upload mapping file in the upper-right of the mapping table.

On the Upload mapping dialog box, upload your manifest file.

Click Done.

Your mappings are auto-configured accordingly. Any columns with non-MoEngage attributes are left blank, and you can either manually map the column or create a new attribute for it. Make sure your manifest file follows the expected conventions.

Any additional columns in your Manifest File that are not in your table will be ignored. Also, if the mapping for an existing table column is not present in the manifest file, MoEngage will keep the mapping blank so that you can manually configure it.

info	

Information

If a column in the manifest file is mapped to a non-existent MoEngage attribute, the mapping will be blank, and you will need to manually create a new attribute from the UI and then map it.

Support for Object Data Type

The Object data type is supported in Databricks as well.

Store Compatible JSON Data in Databricks

To store JSON data inside Databricks, you must change the data type of the column to VARIANT type. For more information, refer here. The JSON stored inside Databricks should be a valid JSON; otherwise, the values will not be written as JSON. Here is an example JSON column:

JavaScript
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{ ""Designation"": ""SSE"", ""Palace"": ""Banglore"", ""age"": 30, ""name"": ""Shasha"" }
Import JSON Data via Databricks

The JSON data can be imported into Databricks by associating existing attributes in the MoEngage platform that have been designated as Object type with columns in Databricks.

You can also create new Object attributes by clicking the Create new attribute in the Select attribute list under Map attribute mapping section.

info	

Information

MoEngage does not support mapping with nested attributes. Only top-level attributes are available to map.

Save Users as a Segment

When importing users, you can include them in a custom segment in MoEngage. The imported users are consistently added to this segment with each sync, and no users will be removed. To save imported users as a custom segment, perform the following steps:

Turn the Save as a custom segment toggle on to save your imported users in a custom segment and send tailored campaigns to the same.

In the Segment name box, type a name for your segment.
In the Column having user ID list, select the Identifier column in your table.
Import Behaviour

In the case of User Imports, you can also choose to update existing users only. This is helpful when you want to bulk update users' attributes in MoEngage without creating any new users. To enable this, select the Update existing users only check box under Import Behaviour:

Send Import Notifications

You can choose to be notified about the status of your imports via email. To do so:

Select the Send import status to check box.
In the Select email id list, select the email ID. You can select up to 10 emails to send the status emails to.


The import status email contains info about the following events:

An import was created
An import was successful
An import failed

After completing all mappings, click Next.

Step 3: Select the Import Frequency

In this step, you must define when to sync with your tables. We support the following types of imports:

One-Time: You can run the import as soon as possible or at a later date and time (scheduled). All existing rows that match the import criteria are imported.
Periodic: You can run your imports hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, or with intervals and advanced configurations.

Optionally, you can specify whether the import should end after a specified set of occurrences or at a particular date. Click Done when ready.

warning	

Warning

Upon initial import, all matching rows from your table are imported. Subsequent imports only include changed rows.

Duplicate Imports

A duplicate import is considered when the:

Users/ Events import types are the same. 
Event name/ Registered/ Anonymous/ All users import subtypes are the same. 
Event name/ Registered/Anonymous/All users import types with the same Databricks connection.
Event name/ Registered/Anonymous/All users import types with the Schema/Dataset and Table/View are the same.

Snowflake Imports
Overview

MoEngage allows customers to import users and events through tables stored inside your Snowflake databases.

Types of Imports

MoEngage can import the following from your Snowflake data warehouse:

Registered Users: These are users who are already registered on MoEngage.
Anonymous Users: These are users who are not yet registered on MoEngage.
Events (Standard and User Defined): MoEngage can import standard events like Campaign Interaction Events as well as your own user-defined events.
Preparing the Data

MoEngage does not need any particular table schema to be prepared for imports. All the columns in your table can be either skipped or mapped separately on the MoEngage Dashboard. However, there are a few things to be taken care of before setting up the imports.

User Imports
Event Imports

When you set up periodic User Imports on MoEngage, we will only sync the data that has changed since the last sync was run. MoEngage uses a timestamp (date + time) column called updated_at to identify which row has changed since the previous sync. You are free to name this column as you like provided it contains the timestamp of the instant when the row's data was last changed. If you're calling this column by a different name in your table, you can always configure this mapping separately on the MoEngage Dashboard.

Importing Datetype attributes

Importing Datetype attributes requires additional steps. You learn more about this in our dedicated guide.

Required Access Permissions

MoEngage will require READ access to your database so that we can pull data into MoEngage. You can either grant these permissions to an existing database user or choose to create a new dedicated database user for MoEngage: 

	-- Grant SELECT permission on all tables in the schema

	GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA `catalog_name`.`schema_name` TO `user@example.com`;

	-- Grant USE SCHEMA permission to access the schema

	GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA `catalog_name`.`schema_name` TO `user@example.com`;

	-- Grant USE CATALOG permission (recommended for complete access)

	GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG `catalog_name` TO `user@example.com`;

Remember to change the following values:

<YOUR_WAREHOUSE_NAME> - The name of the warehouse you want MoEngage to use while executing queries.
<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME> - The name of the database you want to import data from.
<YOUR_PASSWORD> - Give a strong password to the newly created database user.
Set Up Imports from Snowflake
info	

Prerequisites

Ensure you have an existing Snowflake connection setup in the App Marketplace with relevant permissions.
If your security policies require you to whitelist our IPs, you can refer to this article.

You can set up Snowflake Imports from the MoEngage Dashboard >> Segment >> Imports page.

Clicking on ""+Import"" button will allow you to select your source. Click on Snowflake to create a new import for either Users (Registered/Anonymous can be picked in the next step) or Events.

Step 1: Select Your Snowflake Connection and Table Source
Import Name

Enter a name for this import to easily identify it on the Imports Dashboard. Based on the type of import selected, your next steps might vary:

arrow_drop_down
User Imports
arrow_drop_down
Event Imports
Import Source

In this first step, ""Source and format"", you will need to tell MoEngage which Snowflake connection to use and the table to import from.

To get started, select a Snowflake connection to use for this Import. If you have not already created a Snowflake connection, you can click on the ""+ Add connection""  option at the end of the dropdown and you will be taken to the App Marketplace to set it up. You can learn more about how to connect your Snowflake warehouse to MoEngage here.

Once you have selected your Snowflake connection, you will be required to select the schema and table to import from. If there is an error loading your schemas, ensure you have given MoEngage sufficient permissions as mentioned above.

Event Imports

In addition to the above steps, MoEngage provides additional support for tables containing multiple events. If your table contains multiple events, you need to first ""Preview"" the table and then select the ""Table contains multiple events"" option:

MoEngage will use the values of the ""Event name"" column to filter out rows that need to be imported. We will import only those rows that match the selected event name. You can mark an existing column of your table as the column containing the event name. When you select this column and Preview again, we will show you the filtered rows for you to confirm before proceeding:

After you preview your table, you can move on to the next step.

Step 2: Map Your Columns to MoEngage Attributes

In this step, you need to map the columns of your table to the attributes present in MoEngage. All your columns will be shown one below the other:

Column name - This is the column name to be mapped. Below the column name, we also show a sample value (picked from the first row of the fetched table in the previous step) for your reference.
Map attribute - Here you need to pick which MoEngage attribute you want to map the table column to. You can also choose to create a new attribute. Some attributes support ingestion from multiple data types, so you need to pick the data type of the column as well. For the ""DateTime"" columns, you also need to pick the format.
More actions - You can optionally choose to skip the column. The skipped column will not be imported.

Depending on the type of import, there are a few mandatory mappings required:

arrow_drop_down
User Imports
arrow_drop_down
Event Imports

Once a mandatory mapping is marked, it will reflect against the column name in the mapping table and you will no longer be able to mark the column as skippable.

Just like new events, you can also create a new attribute from the dropdown by clicking on ""+ Create attribute"":

Give your attribute a name and select its Data type. You can edit this as well as existing attributes from the Data Management page. Do note that any new attributes you create now will only be available in your app after the first successful import.

Manifest Files

Optionally, you can choose to auto-map these columns by uploading a manifest file. 

To upload a manifest file, click the ""Upload mapping file"" option on the top-right of the mapping table:

	

Upload your manifest file and click Done. Your mappings will be auto-configured accordingly. Any columns with non-MoEngage attributes will be left blank and can either manually map the column or create a new attribute for it. Make sure your manifest file follows the expected conventions as mentioned.

Any additional columns that are present in your Manifest File but not there in your table will be ignored. Also, if the mapping for an existing table column is not present in the manifest file, MoEngage will keep the mapping blank for you to manually configure it.

Do note that if a column in the manifest file is mapped to a non-existent MoEngage Attribute, then the mapping will be blank and you will need to first manually create a new attribute from the UI and then map it.

To store valid JSON inside Snowflake, you must change the data type of the column to VARIANT type. For more information, refer here. The JSON stored inside Snowflake should be a valid JSON; otherwise, the values will not be written as JSON. Here is an example JSON column:

JavaScript
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{ ""Designation"": ""SSE"", ""Palace"": ""Banglore"", ""age"": 30, ""name"": ""Shasha"" }
Import JSON Data via Snowflake

Existing attributes in MoEngage that have been marked as an Object type and are available to map to columns in Snowflake:

You can always create new Object attributes from the mapping step as well, as shown below:

info	

Information

MoEngage does not support mapping with nested attributes. Only top-level attributes are available to map.

Save as a Segment

If you're importing users, you can also add them to a custom segment inside MoEngage. Each time the sync is run, the imported users will continue to be added to this custom segment. We will not delete any users from this segment. You can then send targeted campaigns to this segment. To save your imported users in a custom segment, enable the ""Save as a custom segment"" option:

Give your Segment a name and select the Identifier column in your table.

Import Behaviour

In the case of User Imports, you can also choose to update existing users only. This is helpful when you want to bulk update users' attributes in MoEngage without creating any new users. To enable this, check the ""Update existing users only"" option under Import Behaviour:

Sending Import Notifications

You can, optionally, choose to get notified about your imports' statuses via email. Select up to 10 emails to send the status emails to. You will receive an email about the following events:

An import was created
An import was successful
An import failed

When you are satisfied with all mappings, click Next. If there are any errors, correct them to move forward.

Step 3: Select the Import Frequency

In this step, you need to define when to sync with your tables. We support the following types of imports:

One-Time imports: You can either choose to run the import as soon as possible or at a later date and time (scheduled). All existing rows that match the import criteria will be imported.
Periodic: You can choose to run your imports every few minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, or with intervals and advanced configurations.

Optionally, you can specify whether the import should end after a specified set of occurrences, or at a particular date. Click Done when ready.

warning	

Warning

Please note that the first time the import runs, we will import all the matching rows from your table. On every subsequent import, we will pull in only the changed rows.

Duplicate Imports

You can only configure one unique import at a time. An import is considered a duplicated import when all of these are the same:

Import Type - Users / Events
Import Sub-Type - Event Name / Registered / Anonymous / All users - If the event name is the same, or there already exists a registered/anonymous/all users import with the same Snowflake connection
Snowflake connection
Import schema & table

As long as any one of the above is different, the import is considered unique.

Import Datetime Attributes
Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to import datetime attributes from your Data Warehouses into MoEngage correctly. This will help you build your segmentation queries accurately, resulting in more personalized targeting and analytics.

Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Refer to this document for information on preparing your data according to the expected formats of MoEngage. This section provides the full list of supported datetime formats.

Step 2: Upload a Sample File

For your attribute(s) to be correctly imported as datetime, you must inform MoEngage of the Allowed Datetime types for these attributes. Begin with creating a sample .csv file that contains the following columns:

Table

Column Name	Value
id	

A sample User ID.

Ensure that you provide a unique user identifier.


<attribute_name>	

A sample value of your attribute.


<attribute_name>	

A sample value of your attribute.

info	

Information

Add a new column for each of your datetime attributes. A single row with a dummy User ID is sufficient.

Example Use Case

In this example, we will import the following attributes of type datetime:

my_birthday with the format YYYY-MM-DD
my_order_time with the format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
my_user_creation_time with the format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD

You can download the sample file for this example to follow along.

Step 3: Upload the Sample File

After you have a sample file ready with all your datetime attributes and their expected formats:

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Segments, and then click User Imports.
Click Import users to get started.
In the Import name box, type an identifiable name for your import.
Under Select user type, select Registered users.
Select your sample file. Click Preview file to see if we correctly read all your data.

Click Next to proceed to the mapping.
Mark the first column as your User identifier.
For each of your datetime attributes, click + Create new attribute from the list to add it as a new attribute in MoEngage.

In the Data type list, select Date time and in the Date time format list, select the correct datetime format. We will attempt to auto-capture these for you.

After you have created all your attributes and marked their types, you are ready to import these.

Click Next to proceed.
Select the import frequency as As soon as possible and schedule the import.
We will upload the file and attempt to import it.
Step 4: Pin the Data Types of These Attributes
info	

Note

Only Admins of your accounts can execute actions like changing status, visibility, allowed data types, readable names, and descriptions.

After your import is complete:.

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Segments and then click Data Management.
Perform the steps in this document to set allowed data types for these newly created attributes.
Ensure that you select datetime for each of the attributes. You need to perform these for both User Attributes and Event Attributes.
After you pinned the correct data types for each attribute, they will be correctly ingested as datetime into MoEngage.
Step 5: Import Your Data

You are now ready to import your data into MoEngage. Ensure that you map the newly created attributes to their respective columns."

Import User Data Using CSV

User imports enable you to import new user profiles (or) update profile data of existing users through a CSV file. This is particularly useful when migrating from other platforms to MoEngage or performing mass updates to a large user segment. Some common scenarios where this is useful are listed below:

Importing new users - This is useful for immediately starting with Email Campaigns & SMS Campaigns without waiting for Mobile/Web SDK integrations
Updating existing users - This enables you to update specific user attributes for existing users in MoEngage. This is useful when you are running campaigns that are segmented or personalized on these user attributes, like sending notifications with unique coupon codes. Note: Update existing users will not add new users. It will only update existing users.

This feature is accessible from Segment -> Import Users.

The following step-by-step process outlines how users can be imported into the MoEngage platform.

Step 1: Upload CSV list of users

The first step towards importing users is to upload the .CSV file containing the user details, including their User Attributes. MoEngage allows user lists to be imported as a list of logged-in users (users who have signed up on your website or app) or as a list of Anonymous users (users who have used/visited your app or website but have not registered themselves). These two user list types are explained in detail below.

Registered Users: These are users who have a registered account with your app/website. These users should have a unique identifier in your system, and for this upload, your list should mandatorily map a column that contains this unique user identifier with the user attribute ""ID"". This upload is mostly used to update the user attributes of these registered users.
Anonymous Users: These are users who have not yet signed up on your app/website, but you have some identifier to recognize them i.e. email, mobile number, etc. For this upload type, you need to mark a column from your list (email, mobile number, etc.) as the ""Anonymous ID"" of the user. This upload can be used to create anonymous users in MoEngage using their recognizable unique identifiers and send email/SMS campaigns.

For each upload, you can also download a sample file that clearly explains the data format expected in the CSV File. Once you have selected the upload type that you wish to perform, you can click on the “Browse"" button to select your preferred .csv file. You can also drag and drop the file into the area shown in the image above.

Furthermore, you can specify whether the file contains headers or if you wish to only update details of existing users by selecting their respective options. Once the file upload is completed successfully, you can click on the “Next” button to perform the next step.

info	

Note

In case you provide a unique identifier for LoggedIn Users (or Anonymous Identifier for Anonymous Users) who already exist in the system, the existing users will get updated with new attributes. If the identifier does not exist, MoEngage will create a new user with that identifier.

Step 2: Configure columns of the CSV File

Mapping User Attributes

In this step, you will need to map each column of the uploaded CSV file to existing user attributes (or create a new user attribute). You will see the top 3 rows (excluding Header) and all the columns of your CSV file (scroll horizontally to see all the columns). For each column, select a user attribute from the drop-down.

info	

Note

Column names are case-sensitive. They should exactly match the name of the attribute on the dashboard.
You can not use ""moe_"" as a prefix while naming events, event attributes, or user attributes. It is a system prefix and using it might result in periodic blacklisting without prior communication.

Configuring Identifier

For LoggedIn Users, you need to mandatorily identify one of the columns as a Unique Identifier of the user by selecting ID from the drop-down.

For Anonymous users, you can identify any column as the Anonymous Identifier by hovering over the column and selecting the checkbox Anonymous ID.

Adding new User Attributes

If a column is a new attribute you are adding to your users, click on ""+"" and enter the name of the attribute. In case the new attribute name is the same as one of the existing attributes, you will need to enter a new name.

Adding Values with Commas

In case a value in any column contains a comma (,)- please ensure that the value is enclosed in double quotes ("""") so that the value is retained without being split into multiple columns. For example, if a column contains the value (221B Baker Street, London), it should be enclosed in double quotes (""221B, Baker Street, London""). In any other form, only the data preceding the "","" will be considered for the given column.

Supported data types

The following data types are supported for column values in the file:

String

Language Support

You can import data in any language as long as you are using UTF-8 decodable characters.
Empty values

If your file contains empty values then these would still be imported into MoEngage. In this case, we will create/update user attribute where the value would be empty.

Skipping Column

In case you need to skip any of the columns, just click on ""Skip the column"" and you will not need to configure that column. To hide skipped columns, you can de-select the checkbox ""Show Skipped Columns"" below the configuration.

In case you want to re-include a skipped column, make sure you select the ""Show Skipped Columns"" checkbox and for that column click ""Include & Configure""

Creating a File Segment

File segments can be created for the imported users during the user import workflow itself. This can be achieved by selecting the ""Save as File Segment"" toggle and providing a name for the File segment. Upon successful completion, this custom segment will start appearing in the list of file Segments from where it can be used for any campaigns.

Click Finish, and your data will be uploaded. You will see a list of all your imports, and their status will indicate if the upload has been processed. Once the upload is processed, you will get an email mentioning the details of the upload. Note: You cannot use / or Unicode characters in your file segment name; otherwise, the import will fail.

Step 3: Scheduling imports

In this step, you need to define when to import the files. MoEngage supports the following types of imports:

As soon as possible: The file will start importing as soon as you click Done.
At specific date and time: You can choose to run the import based on your selected Start date and Start time.

Past Imports

After your first user import, you will see a section that will show the past imports in your account and their details. 

info	

Information

The channel reachability and custom segments of imported users are available after thirty minutes of the import completion. We recommend that you plan your campaigns in accordance with this.

Array Support
Simple arrays are supported. Nested and Associated arrays are not supported.
The supported delimiter in the CSV is ""|"".
The supported data types are array double (numeric) and array string. You can select these data types in the list under the Map column to attribute column of the Map columns section while executing Step 2: Import configuration and action.


All the elements in the array have to be homogenous, which means they must be either integer or string. If they are not homogenous, MoEngage tries to typecast (transform) the element and then store the data. Following is the example of an array in a CSV field: [1|2|3]

Array Typecasting: If an array has elements [“1” | 2 | “abc”] of multiple datatypes and the defined datatype is Array Integer, then the final array ingested in MoEngage is [ 1, 2 ]. In this case, “abc” was a string that cannot be transformed into integer and hence not ingested into MoEngage in the final array. For more information on typecasting in MoEngage, refer here.

What is not supported currently?
Attribute Type list and other complex types (JSON, dictionaries, etc.).
Newline character formats other than ""\n"" - .The only newline character currently supported for the .csv files is ""\n"".Other formats like ""Ctrl+M"" or ""\r"" are not supported. 
If your file contains less than 5 rows, then you may face errors during file import. Please add some dummy rows to import in this case."

Import Event Data Using CSV
Overview

Import event feature allows you to import events from a CSV file into your MoEngage account. This feature supports several uses, such as:

Historical Data Import- As a marketer, you can import historical event data into MoEngage to analyze your customers' past behaviour and trends.
Event Data Migration- During a platform migration, you can import events through CSV to ensure a smooth transition of historical event data, ensuring continuity in analysis and campaign management.
Batch Upload- Importing events through CSV allows users to upload a large volume of events in a single batch, saving time and effort. This is useful when updating or populating a large number of events in the MoEngage platform.
Import Event Using CSV

Perform the following steps to import event data using a CSV file:

Log in to the MoEngage dashboard. 
Navigate to Data > Data Imports.

On the Data Imports page, under the Event tab, click Import >Events.

On the Import Events dialog box, click Upload CSV. You can also import events using SFTP and S3.
Click Continue.



The following step-by-step process outlines how events can be imported using CSV into the MoEngage platform.

Step 1: Source and Format

Enter the following details related to the source and format of the CSV file in Step 1.

info	

Information

A CSV file can only upload one event at a time, so it is impossible to use one CSV file to upload multiple events.

 Import name- Enter a name for your import.
Select event- Select the event you want to upload using the CSV file. If the event you are searching for is not listed in the drop-down, click Create new event from the drop-down.
On the Create new event dialog box, enter the Event name and click Create.
Select file- You can either drag and drop a CSV file or upload a CSV file from the computer. You can also Download a sample file to view a sample event file that clearly explains the data format expected in the CSV File. Note that CSV files less than 150 MB are supported.

info	

Information

 

When you upload an event CSV file, the column represents the event attributes.

File preview- Click the Preview file to preview the CSV file you uploaded. You can preview the first five rows of the event CSV file.
Click Next. This takes you to the next step.

Step 2: Import Configuration and Action

This step involves mapping event attributes in MoEngage to event attribute columns in the CSV file.

Required Mapping

This is a mandatory mapping that should be performed. Under the Attribute name, you can view the event attributes of Moengage, such as User Identifier and Event time. These attributes should be mandatorily mapped to the events attributes column in the CSV file listed under Map Column. You can select the column names of the uploaded CSV file from the drop-down menu under the Map column. 

While mapping the Event time, make sure to select the date, time format and time zone.


Map Columns

After successfully mapping the mandatory fields mentioned above, you need to map the remaining events attribute columns in the CSV file to the event attributes of MoEngage. 

The event attributes columns of the CSV file are listed under the Column name, and this is to be mapped to the event attributes of MoEngage under the Map column to attribute.

Perform the following steps to map columns:

You can either select the event attributes of MoEngage from the Select attribute drop-down or click Create new attribute, if the attribute is not listed in the drop-down.


On the Create new attribute dialog box, enter the Attribute name, Data type and click Create.

Select the Data type of each attribute while mapping.
Select the Skip column if you want to skip any columns from mapping. Note that the mandatory fields already mapped are disabled under Map Columns.


Send Import Status

After the event data is imported to MoEngage, you can send the import status to 10 email ids. Select the Email id from the drop down to which you want to send the status and click Next.


Step 3: Scheduling

In this step, you need to define when to import the files. MoEngage supports the following types of imports:

As soon as possible: The file will start importing as soon as you click Schedule Import.

At specific date and time: You can choose to run the import based on your selected Start date and Start time. You can also select the Time zone.


After scheduling, click Schedule Import. The event data now gets imported to MoEngage.

View Imported Event Data

The imported event data gets listed under Data > Data Imports >Events. Click Actions () to View or Duplicate the event data. 


Click View to view the imported event details. Click Actions () to Export file to your email id.

Click Duplicate to duplicate an event with the same event name, and then you can upload the CSV file for it.

The imported event data has the following import status:

Successful- This is displayed when the event import is successful.
Processing- This is displayed when the event import is still in the processing state after being imported. 
Archived- This is displayed when the imported event is archived.
Failed- This is displayed when the event import is failed.

Place all files into an Amazon S3 Folder. You can configure the folder path while setting up the import.

Note that MoEngage will not look for files inside any sub-folders.

Required Access Permissions

You will need to create a new policy so that MoEngage can access your buckets and import files correctly. We request the following permissions:

s3:Get* - This will grant us the permissions required to download your files.
s3:List* - This will grant us the permissions required to view and list your files.
Create a new policy

Navigate to the Policies tab in the navigation bar and select “Get Started” then “Create Policy”. This will allow you to add permissions for your user. Select “Create Your Own Policy”. This will give limited permissions so we only can access the bucket that you specify.

Input the code below when creating your own policy. Specify a “Policy Name” of your choice, and input the code below into the “Policy Document” section. Be sure to replace the <INSERTSID> with your Statement ID, <INSERTPOLICYID> with your Policy ID, and <INSERTBUCKETNAME> with your bucket name. Replace the Principal as well (make sure the access key ID and access secret key belongs to this user/account).

Setup Imports from S3
info	

Prerequisites

Make sure to complete all the steps mentioned in the File Based Imports help doc.

You can set up the S3 Imports from the MoEngage Dashboard > Data > Data Imports 

Please get in touch with your Customer Success team to get 'Data' menu-option enabled.

Clicking on ""+Import"" button will allow you to choose your source. Click on Amazon S3 to create a new import for either Users (Registered/Anonymous can be picked in the next step) or Events.

Step 1: Configure your S3 credentials and file format
User Imports

You will now have the option to select whether you want to import Registered users or Anonymous users:

Choose which one you want to import. Both registered users import and anonymous users import expect different file names. Refer to the Naming Conventions section for more information.

Event Imports

For Event imports, you will now have the option to select which event it is that you want to import:

Based on the event you pick, your file names will be different. Your file names must begin with the Event Name of your chosen event. In the ""Select event"" dropdown, we will show you the Display Names of all the available events in your MoEngage app. Some of these events might have different Display Names and Event Names. When you're selecting an event, MoEngage will show you what is the file name it expects for that particular event in the Event Description box:

In the above example, ""App/Site Opened"" is the Display Name of the chosen event and its Event Name is MOE_APP_OPENED, so the file names should begin with MOE_APP_OPENED. Refer to the Naming Conventions section for more information.

You can also create a new event by clicking on the ""+ Create event"" option at the end of the dropdown.

Give your event a name that is unique. By default, your Display Name will be the same as the Event Name. You can go to the Data Management page to view or edit this event and also your other MoEngage events. Do note that any new events you create now will only be available in your app after the first successful import.

Adding your S3 Credentials

In this first step, ""Source and format"", you will also need to tell MoEngage how to connect to your S3 bucket and where to look for the files.

Refer to the table below to learn how to fill these fields:

Field	Description
S3 bucket name	This is the name of your S3 bucket.

How to find this: n your AWS Console, go to Amazon S3. Click on your bucket from the list, and the name of the bucket is mentioned at the top.

You can also find this in your bucket Properties tab. Look at your S3 ARN, the part after arn:aws:s3::: is your bucket name:

Example: users_to_import 


S3 access key	This is the Access Key ID of the account with which you want MoEngage to connect to your bucket.

You can either choose to provide the Access Key ID of an existing user (programmatic access or console access) or create a new user with Programmatic Access just for MoEngage.

How to find this: n your AWS Console, go to IAM Console >> Users. You can manage your keys for each user here. For an existing user, under the ""Security credentials"" tab, scroll down to the ""Access keys"" section. Either copy an existing access key or create a new one (recommended). Enter the Access Key ID here.

Click here to know more.

Example: 23478207027842073230762374023 


S3 secret key	AWS provides a pair of Access Key IDs and secret keys for each user. Enter the corresponding Secret Access Key for the Access Key ID of the account above.

How to find this: Your Secret Access Key is provided when you make a new Access Key ID. Click here to know more.

Example: wJa...lr/.../bPxRf...LEKEY 


Region	Optionally, you can provide MoEngage with the region in which your bucket is hosted.

How to find this: You can find the region of your bucket under the bucket's Properties.

Click here to know more. 

Example: Asia Pacific (Mumbai)(ap-south-1) 


Folder path 	The path of the folder in which your files will be present. MoEngage does not look inside sub-folders. Do not include trailing slashes. Please note that we do not support root-folders at the moment so ensure that all your files are inside a folder.

How to find this: From the list of objects in your S3 bucket, open the folder you to import from. In the Properties tab, look at the folder's S3 URI. Your folder path is the part after s3://[your-bucket-name]/ excluding the trailing slash.

In the above example, your folder path is: my-dump/to_import

Example:

my_folder
my_folder/sub_folder



Is your file encrypted? 

	MoEngage supports importing encrypted files. We currently support PGP Encryption. For more information, refer to  How Does MoEngage Handle PGP Encryption?

If you are importing encrypted files, select the checkbox.


Decryption Key 	If the Is your file encrypted checkbox is selected, MoEngage will ask for a Decryption Key. This is your Private PGP Key. 

You can generate the PGP keys by yourself or have MoEngage generate them. 

Example:

-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK----- xcMGBGVqq74BCADKpWRLSAdcTtDKpT+LCUCqDoZQ2dlgeBiXNovBVyTPlAOPQSqX bnNGs+U4RpHebjvTxaWCLDBGYOvtZbtv6WvPIF7lzXrIv+DcgLMBQp2b3t+ohRBi 41Ch8CZ04F2lxbVBo

-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----


Signing Key	If a signing key is also configured, the signing key public key needs to be entered in the Signing key section in the following format.

Example:

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

xqq74BCADKpWRLSAdcTtD45nl24KpT+LCUCqDoZQ2dlgeBiXNovBVyTPlAOPQSqX
bnNGs+U4RpHebjvTxaWCLDBGYOvtZbtv6WvPIF7lzXrIv+DcgLMBQp2b3t+ohRBi

Zuz8uOaXWtFPmV536uQT

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----


Key passphrase	Enter the passphrase that was generated along with the encryption key pair.
Import Name

Enter a name for this import to easily identify it on the Imports Dashboard.

File configurations

Select the DateTime format that will be in your file name. As per the Naming Conventions defined above, your file name should end with _<date time format>.csv. Refer to the table provided earlier to see which DateTime formats we support. The info message below will update according to your chosen DateTime format so that you can easily cross-verify if your file names are as per expectations.

After you've configured your S3 Credentials and your file names format, MoEngage will try to connect to your S3 bucket and fetch the most recent file available with the specified format. Ensure you have at least one file available in the specified location otherwise, you will not be able to continue. Once you're ready, click the ""Fetch file"" button to fetch a recent file.

If your S3 credentials and chosen file format are correct, then MoEngage will show you the preview of the top 5 rows from a recent file:

However, sometimes, there can be an error while fetching the file from your S3 buckets. These are some common errors:

Given S3 Access Key is not valid - This means that your S3 credentials are incorrect. Please enter the correct credentials and try to fetch the file again.
Please check the folder path and try again - This means that either your folder path is incorrect or there are no CSV files present inside the given folder path.
Found zero data rows in the file - This means that the file MoEngage fetched did not have any rows after the header row (the total row count of the file is 1). We expect at least 2 rows (1 header row + 1 data row) in the file since the first row is always treated as the header row. Learn more about the File Structure.

Once you are satisfied with the preview of the file, click Next to continue to the mapping step.

Step 2: Map your columns to MoEngage Attributes

In this step, you need to map the columns of your CSV files to the attributes present in MoEngage. All your columns will be shown one below the other:

Column name - This is the column name (picked from the first row of the fetched file in the previous step) to be mapped. Below the column name, we also show a sample value (picked from the second row of the fetched file in the previous step) for your reference.
Map attribute - You need to pick which MoEngage attribute you want to map the CSV column to. You can also choose to create a new attribute. Some attributes support ingestion from multiple data types, so you need to pick the data type of the column as well. For the ""DateTime"" columns, you also need to pick the format.
More actions - You can optionally choose to skip the column. The skipped column will not be imported.

Depending on the type of import, there are a few mandatory mappings required:

User imports - You need to select the column having:
Registered - 
User ID - Your file should mandatorily have a column that contains a unique user identifier (that identifies a user’s account in your system).
Anonymous - 
Anonymous ID - You need to mark a column from your file (email, mobile number, etc.) as an identifier of these users.
Event imports - You need to select the column having:
User ID - This column will be used to match the users in MoEngage to your CSV files.
Event Time - You need to map either Event Time (UTC) or Event Time (App Timezone). If you have chosen Event Time (UTC), then the ""Event Time"" of the imported event will be converted to the timezone chosen in your MoEngage Dashboard settings:

Once a mandatory mapping is marked, it will reflect against the column name in the mapping table and you will no longer be able to mark the column as skippable. 

Just like new events, you can also create a new attribute from the dropdown by clicking on ""+ Create attribute"":

Give your attribute a name and select its Data type. You can edit this as well as existing attributes from the Data Management page. Do note that any new attributes you create now will only be available in your app after the first successful import.

Adding Fields

You can also add fields directly from the dashboard by clicking on +Add Field. This will create a new field at the bottom of the list below where you can enter the attribute mapping manually.

Manifest Files

Optionally, you can choose to auto-map these columns by uploading a manifest file. 

To upload a manifest file, click the ""Upload mapping file"" option on the top-right of the mapping table:

If it is a fresh import, you can find the sample manifest file, which can be used as a reference point as you create an appropriate mapping file for your import.

If you duplicate an existing import and upload a mapping file, you will find your existing mapping file already added, which can be downloaded.

Upload your manifest file and click Done. Your mappings will be auto-configured accordingly. For any additional attributes mentioned in the manifest file but not currently present in MoEngage, a modal will open up, which will list down these attributes for you to create the attributes.

Any additional columns that are present in your Manifest File but not in your CSV file will be ignored. Also, if the mapping for an existing CSV column is not present in the manifest file, MoEngage will keep the mapping blank for you to manually configure it.

Do note that if a column in the manifest file is mapped to a non-existent MoEngage Attribute, then the mapping will be blank, and you will need to first manually create a new attribute from the UI and then map it.

Sending Import Notifications

You can, optionally, choose to get notified about your imports' statuses via email. Select up to 10 emails to send the status emails to. You will receive an email in the following events:

An import was successful.
An import failed, along with the possible cause of failure.

When you are satisfied with all mappings, click Next. If there are any errors, correct them to move forward.

Step 3: Select the Import frequency

In this step, you need to define when to import files from your S3 bucket. We support the following types of imports:

One-Time Imports: You can either choose to run the import as soon as possible or at a later date and time (scheduled)
Periodic: You can choose to run your imports hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, or with intervals and advanced configurations.

For each run, MoEngage will try to fetch a file with the configured DateTime format, so ensure your file names are configured properly. Optionally, you can specify whether the import should end after a specified set of occurrences or at a particular date. Click ""Done"" when ready.

Duplicate Imports

You can only configure one unique import at a time. An import is considered a duplicated import when all of these are the same:

Import Type - Users / Events
Import Sub-Type - Event Name / Registered / Anonymous - If the event name is the same, or there already exists a registered/anonymous users import with the same S3 path and bucket name.
S3 Folder Path
Bucket Name

As long as any one of the above is different, the import is considered unique.

You can only configure one unique import at a time. An import is considered a duplicated import when all of these are the same:

Import Type - Users / Events
Import Sub-Type - Event Name / Registered / Anonymous - If the event name is the same, or there already exists a registered/anonymous users import with the same SFTP path.
SFTP Folder Path - The complete folder path, including hostname. 

As long as any one of the above is different, the import is considered unique.

Using PGP Encryption in MoEngage
Overview - PGP Encryption Process

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a security program that can be used to encrypt sensitive files. MoEngage supports PGP encryption in File Imports (S3 Import, SFTP Import). This article would help elaborate on how you can use PGP encryption for your sensitive files if you wish to use encryption.

Requisites
PGP key pair - A PGP key pair consists of a Public key and a Private key. The Public key is used to encrypt the file, and the private key is used to decrypt the file. The private key should not be shared with anyone as it will be used to decrypt the sensitive information in the file. Notably, this Private key plays a pivotal role in the SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) integration process with MoEngage, serving as the input.
A signing key pair consists of a Public key and a Private key. The Public key is used to sign the file and is taken as input in MoEngage SFTP integration. Internally, the private key is used to verify the signature.

Steps to Use PGP Key Pair

The following steps describe how to use PGP encryption through GnuPG, a free implementation of the PGP standard.

Step 1: Generate a standard key pair (public and private)

You can generate the PGP key pair using a PGP tool like GnuPG. If you are generating the key pair, follow the example below. If MoEngage is generating the key pair for you, skip to steps 1 and 2.

Step 2: Generate a Public Key and Encrypt the Files

If MoEngage generates the public key, they will share it with you. Conversely, if you generate it, you should encrypt the file using this public key and upload the encrypted files to the S3/SFTP folder.

Encrypt Public Key
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	 

	gpg --import <public-key.pgp>

	gpg --encrypt --sign --armor -r secops@moengage.com <File-name>

The --sign option is used to encrypt the file by signing the file.

Step 3: Add the keys in the MoEngage Dashboard

If you generate the keys, the procedure is to input the private key into the decryption key segment on the MoEngage dashboard and fill the key passphrase section with the passphrase. On the other hand, if the keys are generated by MoEngage, ensure Is your file encrypted? checkbox is selected during the first step of Data Imports. For more information, refer to  Adding your S3 Credentials (S3 Imports) and Adding your S3 Credentials (SFTP Imports) sections.

Step 4: Decrypt a File

To decrypt an encrypted file, you'll need two essential elements: your private key and the corresponding passphrase you established while creating the key pair. In the PGP software, navigate to and select the desired encrypted file, then key in your passphrase. The software will proceed to decrypt your file, generating an unencrypted rendition of the original document.

For Python users, consider the python-gnupg package, a Pythonic wrapper for the gpg command.

Example
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	import gnupg

	import os

	# intialising

	gpg = gnupg.GPG(gnupghome=os.path.expanduser( '~' ))

	gpg.encoding = 'utf-8'

	# importing the private key to the server where we are going to decrypt the file

	key_data = """"

	import_result = gpg.import_keys(key_data)

	gpg.trust_keys(import_result.fingerprints, ""TRUST_ULTIMATE"")

	#

	encrypted_file_path = ""/path/to/encrypted/file""

	with open(encrypted_file_path, 'rb') as file:

	status=gpg.decrypt_file(file, passphrase="""", output=""/path/where we want to store the decrypted file"")

	print(status.ok)

	print(status.stderr)
Step 5: Verify the File's Signature [Optional Step]

If a signing key has been used to sign your file, proceed to copy the public key and signing key pair into the respective section on MoEngage dashboard. MoEngage will then verify the file placed in the S3/SFTP folder for a signature match, as shown below.

Example
Light

content_copy
Copy Code
	if status.signature_id: # if signature verified then it has value else None

	print(""signature verified"")

	else:

File Based Imports
Auxiliary Data
Overview

Auxiliary Data helps you import supplementary user information to an existing database. Often, marketers send campaigns to users around specific events that may require additional short-term data that needn't be stored permanently. For example:

Businesses may wish to personalize campaigns with data about limited-time offers and discounts. Auxiliary data can be used for campaign personalization for the duration of the offer.
An organization that runs a monthly fantasy sports league (where users collect points and win rewards every week) may want to send campaigns to users based on their participation in the current month. The points accumulated by a user would expire at the month's end and cease to be relevant afterward. In such cases, Auxiliary data can be used to import the data to MoEngage and personalize campaigns.

Auxiliary data helps you ingest relevant information that is required only for a specific timeframe and needs to be stored temporarily into MoEngage using file imports and use the ingested data for campaign creation. Auxiliary data also allows you to mark the fields that need to be updated in the user profile permanently.

info	

Information

To enable the Auxiliary Data feature for your account, contact your CSM or the MoEngage Support team.

To contact the MoEngage Support team, you can raise a ticket through the Support Web Form within the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer here.
 

Use Cases

Brands can leverage Auxiliary Data for varied use cases:

Drive Dynamic Personalization: Enhance personalization effortlessly by uploading supplemental data through files. This data may include coupon details, transaction information, survey data, limited-period contest data, and offline engagement data to craft tailored communication and engage customers.
Hassle-free and Targeted Engagement: Simplify targeted engagement by swiftly uploading your customer segments using files. This eliminates the need to upload new customer data as primary data or concatenate and permanently store these segments.
Auto-Refresh Recurring Campaigns: Automate recurring campaigns with frequently changing content through Auxiliary Data. Instead of creating new campaigns every time, brands can periodically upload campaign content using files for automatic triggering.
Incorporate Custom Recommendations: Brands utilizing in-house or external recommendation engines can upload tailor-made recommendations using files and then promptly deliver them to customers.
Legacy Data Integration: Organizations using legacy platforms can efficiently ingest data for engagement by uploading files. This streamlines the engagement process, eliminating the need for complex integrations and thus preventing disruptions to existing workflows.

By utilizing Auxiliary Data in these ways, brands can enhance their marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and streamline their operations.

Importing Auxiliary Data to MoEngage

To import Auxiliary data:

Navigate to the Import management dashboard (Segment -> S3/SFTP Imports) and click on the Data tab.
Click on the  option available at the top right corner of the screen.
Choose Auxiliary data from the available options.
Select the S3 or SFTP option in the popup that opens.
Click continue to go to the Auxiliary Data Import UI.
The Auxiliary Data Import UI has three main steps, and they are:
Configure Source and Format
Map your source file's columns to MoEngage attributes
Schedule the import and define import frequency.
Once imported, you can see the import-related information on the Auxiliary data tab of the Import Management Dashboard.
You can view the Auxiliary data or duplicate it from the dashboard.

Please note that MoEngage maintains historical logs of Auxiliary CSV files imported in the last 60 days. Although files uploaded beyond 60 days will not be visible in the Import logs in Data Imports -> Auxiliary data section, the data in those files will be retained in MoEngage based on the set Data retention period.

 

Step 1: Configure Source and Format

The following fields are available in this section.

Import Name - This field lets you specify a name for this import. You can identify this import using the name specified here on the Imports Dashboard.
Specify S3/SFTP Details
S3
SFTP

In this section, you can specify the details of the S3 Bucket where the file to be imported. The following fields are available here:

Field	Description
S3 bucket name	The name of your S3 bucket
S3 access key	

The Access Key ID of the account you want MoEngage to connect to your S3 bucket.


S3 secret key	

The Secret Access Key corresponding to your S3 bucket's Access key ID.


Region	This is the region in which your bucket is hosted.
Folder Path	The path of the folder in which your files will be present.

For more information, refer to adding your S3 credentials.

File Encryption - If you upload an encrypted file, you can specify the encryption details by checking the Is your file encrypted? checkbox. MoEngage supports PGP encryption. For more information about how it works, refer to PGP encryption. 

Once the checkbox is checked, you can provide the following details:

Field	Description

info	

Note

File names must adhere to the file naming conventions specified for data imports. For information about this, refer to Naming Conventions.
For information about the supported date and time formats, refer to Date and Time formats.
For information about structuring the columns in your CSV file, refer to File Structure. 
File Name Configuration - You can specify the prefix, date, and time format that will be present in your file name. This will fetch the files from the specified S3 bucket/SFTP Folder. The Filenames should have a prefix and datetime separated by ""_"". Prefix should preferably consist of alphabets, numerals, and ""_"". The default prefix is ""aux_data_"". Sample File Name: registered_userdata_20220131.csv
Enter the prefix name of your file and the time format, and click Fetch Files. The list of files in the S3 bucket with the specified name will be fetched and populated in the file to preview the dropdown.
Select the file of your choice from the dropdown to preview the top 5 rows of the file.
Click Next to move to the second step.
Step 2: Map your data to MoEngage Attributes

In this step, you can specify the file's primary key (the column containing a unique value in each row of the file). To set the primary key, choose the column name that contains the unique field from the Primary key dropdown. The dropdown contains the list of all columns in the file chosen in the previous step.

You can do the following optionally after choosing the primary key:

Save as custom segment - This option lets you create a custom segment from the user base in the imported file. To save a custom segment:
Turn on the Save as custom segment toggle.
Provide the segment name. The custom segment name has to be unique (two segments cannot have the same name).
Map the column that contains the user ID to facilitate custom segment creation. This column would be the ID field in the user profile of the users in MoEngage. For more information, refer to ID in MoEngage.
Update user profile attributes - This option lets you update the Auxiliary data in the User Profiles of the respective users in MoEngage. To update user profile attributes:
Turn on the Update user profile attributes toggle.
Map the column that contains the user ID so that the user can be identified in MoEngage. This column would be the ID field in the user profile of the users in MoEngage. For more information, refer to ID in MoEngage.
Once the ID column is specified, the user attributes dropdown is enabled. Select the attribute from the dropdown if you use a custom attribute to store the ID value.
To map other fields, click the Update column checkbox at the end of the row to enable the user attribute dropdown. Select the attribute to which the column name should be mapped.
 Any column that is not mapped will be treated as Auxiliary data, and the data storage policies for Auxiliary data will apply. When columns are mapped to user attributes, they would be updated permanently, and the rate limits for user data imports would apply. For more information, refer to User Data Imports.
Send import status - You can send the status of the user imports by turning on this toggle. You can send the import status to a maximum of ten email IDs. Once the toggle is turned on, the Email ID dropdown will be available with the list of email IDs.

Please note that all Auxiliary data will be type-casted to String datatype.

 

Click Next to schedule the import.

Step 3: Import Schedule and Frequency

In this step, you can schedule the frequency of imports and the expiration time of the Auxiliary data.

Import Frequency

The following options are available here:

One Time - You can schedule the import once as soon as possible or at a fixed time using this option. The following options are available here:
As soon as possible - This option will start the import immediately.
At fixed time - This option helps you import the data on a specific date and time and contains the following fields:
Timezone - the timezone in which the import would happen.
Start Date - the date on which the import would start.
Send Time - the time at which the import would start on the specified date. Select am or pm depending on the time of day the import should begin.
Periodic - You can schedule the import periodically using this option. The following fields are available here:
Timezone - the timezone in which the import would happen.
Start Date - the date on which the import would start.
Send Time - the time at which the import would start on the specified date. Select am or pm depending on the time of day the import should begin.
Periodic - the periodicity of the import. You can choose from three options: Daily, Weekly, and Monthly, from the radio buttons available to the left of the screen.
Periodicity	Description
Daily	Repeat every - This option lets you specify the number of days after which the data import should be repeated.
Weekly	

Repeat every - This option lets you specify the number of weeks for which the data import should be repeated.

 

Repeat on - This option lets you specify the day(s) of the week on which the import is to be repeated (For example, if you wish to import the data every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, select these days in this option).


Monthly	

Repeat every - This option lets you specify the number of months for which the data import should be repeated.

 

Repeat on - This option lets you do the following:

Days of the month - Choose this option for repeating the imports on specific dates. Select the date(s) of the month when the data should be imported. (For example, to import dates on the 5th and the 25th of a month, select the 5th and 25th in the calendar widget.).
Note: If the selected date(s) doesn't exist in the month specified (as it is a shorter month), the import will be scheduled on the last date of the month. (For example, if the 30th and 31st are selected and the month is February, an import would be scheduled on the 28th of the month).
Days of week -  Choose this option to specify the day(s) of the week on which the import has to be scheduled (For example, if you wish to import data every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, select these days in this option).

Data action

You can define the Auxiliary data expiry in the Aux data expiry dropdown.

Import Frequency	Auxiliary data Expiry
One Time	You can choose one of the following values in the Auxiliary data retention period dropdown - 1, 2, 7, 15, 30 days, 2 months, 3 months,.., 1 year, and Infinite retention. For One Time imports, you can define the Auxiliary data expiry / retention period.
Periodic	

For periodic imports, you can choose one of the following values in the Auxiliary data retention period dropdown - 1, 2, 7, 15, 30 days, 2 months, 3 months,..., 1 year and Infinite retention. It is recommended to set the retention period longer than the periodicity of the import. 

If a daily import is set with a retention period of 30 days, the new data flowing in the second day would have a retention period of 30 days whereas the auxiliary data imported in the first day would now have retention period of 29 days. 

Click Done to import the Auxiliary data. Once you've imported successfully, you can see the import added to the import management dashboard.

 

Editing the retention period - You can edit the retention period of an existing Auxiliary import by clicking on the specific Import action 3 dot menu -> Edit 

Editing the retention period is only allowed when:

Current UI
Revamped UI

Previewing Uploaded Files

You can preview uploaded files in the revamped UI in the File Preview section, as shown in the following image. Previewing the file allows you to view the first five rows of the CSV. This is a mandatory step and helps you validate the file uploaded into MoEngage before mapping in the next step.

Changes in Step 2

Enhanced Mapping table

In the current version, the UI for mapping the columns to attributes is in a tabular format, while in the new version fields are lined in rows instead of the table thus making mapping easier. The row-wise mapping helps in having a single view of all the fields mapped and eases navigation across columns.

Current UI
Revamped UI

Configuring ID

In the current version, ID is configured in the has also changed. In the revamped version, the ID can be mapped in the Required mapping section which is located above the Map columns section (please refer to the UI below).

Upload Mapping File

The revamped version will have the option to upload the mapping file in JSON format which maps the column with the attribute. MoEngage will identify fields not present in the mapping file which then needs to be mapped manually.

Customizing Email Alerts

You can now configure the email alerts that go out when the User import fails or successfully uploads the CSV file. Email alerts can be configured to be sent to 10 recipients maximum.


Addition of Step 3

You can schedule your imports in step 3, as shown in the following image. The following options are available:

As soon as possible
Schedule the import at a specific date and time


Support for Array Attributes

You can upload array attributes while importing data.

Guidelines to import array attributes

MoEngage supports simple arrays. Nested and associative arrays are not supported.
The supported delimiter in the CSV is ‘|’ 
Datatypes supported are Array Double (numeric), and Array String. These datatypes will be available in the datatype dropdown under Mapping column to attribute in Step 2.
All the elements in the array have to be homogenous (all the elements will be either double or all string ). If they are not homogenous, MoEngage will try to typecast (transform) the element and then store the data. 

Example of an array in a CSV field: [1|2|3]"

Information

If your system requires IP whitelisting, refer here before setting up the S3 Integration for Data exports.

S3 Integration for Data Exports

S3 is a highly scalable storage system offered by Amazon Web Services. Integration with the S3 buckets will allow MoEngage to share periodic exports of required data in JSON format. To get started with S3 integration, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Create S3 Bucket

Even if you have an S3 bucket already, we still recommend creating a new bucket specifically for MoEngage so you can limit permissions.

To create a bucket for your app, open theS3 console and follow the instructions to Sign in or Create an Account with AWS.
Once signed in, select “S3” from the “Storage Content Delivery” category.
Select “Create Bucket” on the next screen and you will be prompted to create your bucket and select a region.
Step 2: Create Policy
Navigate to the Policies tab in the navigation bar and select “Get Started” then “Create Policy”. This will allow you to add permissions for your user. Select “Create Your Own Policy”. This will give limited permissions so we only can access the bucket that you specify.

Input the code below when creating your own policy. Specify a “Policy Name” of your choice, and input the code below into the “Policy Document” section. Be sure to replace the INSERTSID with your Sid, INSERTPOLICYID with your policy id, and with your bucket name.

	            ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:s3:::<INSERTBUCKETNAME>/*""

	            }

	        ]

	}

 

Step 3: Enable S3 Exports on the MoEngage App Marketplace

To create a new S3 Buckets connection, perform the following steps:

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click App marketplace.
On the App marketplace page, in the search bar, type Amazon S3.
Click the Amazon S3 tile.
On the Amazon S3 page, click the Integrate tab, and then click + Add connection.

Enter S3 bucket connection details.

Field	Description	Example
Connection name	This is the name of the connection. Enter a unique and identifiable name.	

My S3 Export

 

 


Bucket name	

This is the name of your S3 bucket.

 

How do I find the bucket name?

 

In your AWS console, go to S3 and select your bucket from the list. The bucket's name is mentioned at the top.



 

You can also find this in your bucket Properties tab. In your S3 ARN, the part after arn:aws:s3::: is your bucket name:



 

 

	

test-bucket


Folder path	

This is the path of the folder in which your files are dumped. Do not begin or end with a slash. The final path of the dump is:

 

s3://<your-bucket-name>/[<folder_path>_]<connection_name>/export_day=<DD-MM-YYYY>/event_exports_<export_timestamp>.json.gz

 

The export timestamp is the EPOCH timestamp of when the file was generated in the UTC timezone. Your final path is displayed on the UI for your confirmation.

 

How do I find the folder path?

 

From the list of objects in your S3 bucket, open the folder in which you want to dump the files. On the Properties tab, look at the folder's S3 URI. Your folder path is the part after s3://[your-bucket-name]/ excluding the trailing slash.

 

In the example above, your folder path is my-dump/to_import

	
my_folder
my_folder/sub_folder

 


Bucket region	

This is the name of your S3 bucket.

 

How do I find the bucket region?

 

In your AWS Console, go to S3 and select your bucket from the list. The bucket's name is mentioned at the top.

 

 

You can also find this in your bucket Properties tab. Look at your S3 ARN, the part after arn:aws:s3::: is your bucket name:

 

	

Asia Pacific (Mumbai)

 

(ap-south-1)


Select events	

Select which events you want to export to your S3 buckets. You can choose to export All events (existing and new events coming into MoEngage in the future) or select events manually and export only those events.

	

 


User properties	

You can select which user properties (user properties and device properties) you want to export with your events.

	

 


Frequency	

Select how often you want to export these events. MoEngage offers three frequencies:

Every 15 minutes: MoEngage dumps files at 15-minute intervals.
Daily: MoEngage dumps files at the end of each day, 00:00 UTC.
Weekly: MoEngage dumps files every Monday at 00:00 UTC.

Warning: Frequently changing your export frequency is not recommended, which might result in data loss or duplication.

	

 


File Encryption	

MoEngage supports exporting encrypted files. Currently, it only supports PGP encryption. If you want to export encrypted files, turn the File Encryption toggle on. MoEngage will encrypt the GZIPPED file with the provided public key and append the extension of .gpg.

 

After decrypting the file, unzip it to view the files exported. You can then view them normally.

 

For example: event-exports_1735198203.json.gz.gpg

	

 


Encrypt Key	

If the File Encryption toggle is turned on, you must enter your PGP Public Key in the Encrypt Key section. MoEngage will use this key to encrypt all files it exports, but you must handle the decryption mechanism at your end.

 

For example:

 

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

 

xqq74BCADKpWRLSAdcTtD45nl24KpT+LCUCqDoZQ2dlgeBiXNovBVyTPlAOPQSqX
bnNGs+U4RpHebjvTxaWCLDBGYOvtZbtv6WvPIF7lzXrIv+DcgLMBQp2b3t+ohRBi

sFCynJXweqijZxtmUl9V1838sUVOoTzfmGwu7PzV99tAiOlxBjYF9SXIYY/GOoJN
Zuz8uOaXWtFPmV536uQT

 

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

	

 

Click Test Connect to test your details.

Upon clicking Test Connect, MoEngage attempts to verify the credentials. You can also directly click Connect to proceed. After the setup is complete, the files are dumped into the specified folder path based on your selected export frequency.

Events and attributes

With the MoEngage and S3 integration, you can export all events coming into MoEngage to your S3 buckets. By default, MoEngage tracks some standard events and user properties through its SDKs. You can read about our standard events and attributes here. You can also export any custom user-defined event you tracked in MoEngage.

Data Export Format

Integrate AWS Key Management Service with Amazon S3
Create an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Customer Master Key (CMK) using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. You can skip this step if your AWS KMS is already generated.
Enable the AWS KMS key for use with S3 by adding permissions to the AWS KMS key policy. Here is an example key policy allowing the key to be used for S3 encryption:

	]

	}
Configure the S3 bucket to use the AWS KMS key for encryption. You can do this while creating the bucket or modifying the bucket's properties.
Under the S3 Management Console, navigate to the bucket where we want to enable server-side encryption.
Click the Properties tab and scroll down to the Default encryption section.
Select the Server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS) option for ""Encryption"" and select the AWS KMS key you created from the drop-down menu. Use only your KMS key's AWS KMS ARN.
Click Save to apply the encryption configuration to the bucket. Your S3 objects will be automatically encrypted using the AWS KMS key you integrated.
We require the AWS KMS Key ARN, so kindly provide it to us. We must whitelist it from MoEngage's end.
info	

Information

Why is whitelisting KMS key ARN necessary?

The AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Key ARN (Amazon Resource Name) is required for whitelisting because it uniquely identifies the KMS key that you want to allow access to.
When you whitelist a KMS key ARN, it means you are specifying that only authorized entities or services with access to that specific KMS key can perform encryption or decryption operations using the key.
Whitelisting the KMS key ARN provides additional security by ensuring that only authorized resources can interact with the key. It helps prevent unauthorized access or usage of the key, reducing the risk of data breaches or malicious activities.
By specifying the KMS key ARN in the whitelist, you have granular control over which resources can access and use the KMS key, improving the overall security of your key management and encryption processes.

Analyze the Volume of Data Exports
Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to calculate/analyze the volume of events that were exported from your MoEngage App using either Streams or Data Warehouse Exports. This can help you track the amount of data that you are receiving and your monthly export volume usage.

Total Volume of Events Exported

Please contact your MoEngage Customer Success Manager for the total volume of events being exported.

Calculate the Volume of Individual Events

In case you want a detailed event-wise breakdown of the total volume, you can calculate it. However, this is currently a manual process. Note that there can be some discrepancies between the number of events shown on the MoEngage Dashboard and the actual number of events received by you.

Step 1: Get the List of Events Being Exported
Data Warehouses Exports
Streams

If you have set up automated exports through the App Marketplace, you can view all your exports on the Integrate tab on the Partner page. The following is an example for S3 Exports:

On your MoEngage Dashboard go to App Marketplace > Amazon S3 > Integrate.
View the list of integrations you have currently active:

Click the three dots on the integration card, and click Edit.
Under Export Details, look at the Select events option:
All Events: If you have selected All events, getting a breakdown for each event might be a more time-consuming task.
Selected events: If you have selected a few events you want to export, make a list of these events. You will need this list later.
Step 2: Analyze the Volume of Each Event Exported

With MoEngage Analytics, you can obtain a comprehensive breakdown of the total count for each event. As and when MoEngage receives an event, it is forwarded to your destination without any modifications. This ensures that the volume of events displayed on the MoEngage Dashboard accurately corresponds to the volume of events received by you.

On your MoEngage Dashboard go to Analyze > Behavior.
Select your events from the list of events being exported. Click + Add Event to add multiple events. A breakdown of 10 events at a time will be provided:

Under Filter Users, select All Users.
Under Behavior Options, select Total Events.
Set the duration as the duration you want to check. Typically, this is a window of 30 days.
Click Apply when ready to see your report.
After your results are loaded, look at the Behavior Table:

If your second column is not ""Sum"", you can click the down arrow next to the column and select ""Sum"". This should show the total number of events that have occurred in the selected period.
Click Download CSV to export this report.
Repeat this process for all the events you are exporting. We suggest that you monitor only events that highly impact your analysis such as ""Email Sent"", ""Email Opened"", and so on.

Note

The report on the MoEngage Dashboard is in the App Timezone. MoEngage Automated Data Exports happen in the UTC Timezone. Please account for this difference when you are generating reports at your end."

Introduction

With MoEngage Event Exports, you can forward events to various third-party tools. We offer the following capabilities:

MoEngage Streams - Streams allow you to forward events like user actions, campaign interaction events, and so on available in MoEngage to a pre-defined API endpoint in near real-time.
Data Warehouses - MoEngage supports multiple data warehouses as destinations to forward events directly to your tables. We support:
Amazon Redshift
Google BigQuery (via GCS)
Snowflake
Cloud Storages - MoEngage also supports multiple cloud storages as destinations to forward events as JSON files in your buckets.
Amazon S3
Google Cloud Storages
SFTP
Export Schema

The export schema depends on the type of destination. Each category (Data Warehouse, Cloud Storages, APIs) has a consistent schema to account for various MoEngage Events and User-Defined Events.

Streams (API)

MoEngage will make a Bulk API call to your provided API Endpoint. Here is the generic structure:

Table Structure

The overall structure of the table will remain fixed for all types of events. Any new user property or event attribute that is exported will be part of the user_attributes or event_attributes column respectively. All the events will be dumped in a single table containing all necessary information such as event names, event times, etc for easy analysis.

We follow the below generic schema:

Any column beginning with event_attributes_ contains an event attribute. This will be followed by the event attribute name like event_attributes_campaign_name.
Any column beginning with user_attributes_ contains a user attribute. This will be followed by the user attribute name like user_attributes_moengage_user_id.
Any column beginning with device_attributes contains a device attribute. This will be followed by the device attribute name like device_attributes_moengage_device_id.
We also have three JSON (or equivalent) fields called event_attributes, user_attributes, and device_attributes. Each of these fields contains raw JSON fields in the form of a dictionary.

Google BigQuery (Generic)

MoEngage exports events to your BigQuery tables via GCS Buckets using the BigQuery Transfer File service. There are two ways you can create a table for your events in BigQuery:

Create a table specific to your exported events by using the schema of your exported files.

Create a table that has a generic schema.

If you want to create a generic schema and are unsure of your events, you can use this schema:

JSON

Sync segments from one MoEngage App to another

Using Outbound Segment Sync with our Cohort Sync API makes it easy to sync your segments across multiple MoEngage Apps. Read more about how to set this up.

 

Syncing segments using this feature is quick and straightforward. Just choose your destination platform, select desired user segments, set the sync frequency, and start syncing.

To begin, you first need to set up and connect with the destination platform. There are two ways to do that. Learn more about these in the next section.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Outbound Segment Sync is an add-on feature. Connect with your account manager or raise a support ticket to get it enabled for your account.

 

Connect Destinations

There are two ways of setting up, and connecting with the destination platform:
1. Using partner integrations
2. Configure custom destination using an API endpoint

Before we deep dive into these two methods, you must request access to enable Custom Destinations. To do so you can navigate to:
App Marketplace -> Click on Explore -> Select Integrate tab -> Request Access

Once enabled, you can get started with any of the two methods below.

Using partner integrations

MoEngage provides preexisting partner integrations that simplify the configuration process and API endpoint testing. With just a few clicks, you can start syncing segments to partner platforms. Check out the partner help docs for more information on these integrations.

Storyly 


Configure custom destination using an API endpoint

To set up a destination using API endpoints, go to the App Marketplace and navigate to the Custom Destinations section. Add a custom destination and configure it.

Setting up a Custom Destination to sync segments to your endpoint
Provide an integration name to identify your endpoint.
Provide a URL Endpoint to sync the data. Example:  https://api.example.com/segments
If your system requires IP whitelisting, refer here.

Provide a list of key-value pairs that can be added to the headers and parameters as per your requirement. This is optional.
Authentication - Basic auth and No auth are supported.
Choose the user identifier you want to sync from the MoEngage user segment to your endpoint. This should be a key that uniquely identifies a user at your destination. You can rename this key as per the user identifier at your destination. 
Request Body:
add_users - This list contains the users to be added to a particular segment.
remove_users - This is the list that contains the users to be removed from a particular segment.
Both add_users & remove_users fields are not mandatory in one request: Only one of these can come in the request payload, or both of them can come in the request payload or they can be an empty array as well.
These keys cannot be removed. However, they can be renamed as per your destination.

[Optional] List of Key-Value pairs can be added to the list of add and remove users as per your requirement.
Choose the throttle:

MoEngage will send 25000 requests per minute.
Each request can have between 100 to 10000 users simultaneously that can be set in the throttle.
Allow resync of all users in the segment to the destination: 
In case of any issue with a particular sync, your destination might hold incorrect users in the segment. To maintain the accurate state of the users in a segment, you have the option of resyncing all users in the segment.
Choosing to allow resync all users will enable the action on each synced segment. However, do ensure that the destination should be able to drop all users in the segment and allow the resync of the entire segment once again.
Request Preview - When you edit the destination configuration, you can view the updated request body that will be sent by MoEngage.
Test your connection by sending a sample user value to the configured destination. You will also be able to see the response - either successful or failed along with the message received from the destination.
API Request Format

When MoEngage sends a segment to your API endpoint, the request format will be as below: 

Request Body:
{
  ""type"": ""segment_sync"",
  ""pagination"": {
    ""total_pages"": 14,
    ""page_count"": 12
  },
  ""data"": {
    ""moengage_sync_id"": ""{{sync_id}}"",
    ""moengage_sync_name"": ""{{sync_name}}"",
    ""moengage_execution_id"": ""{{execution_id}}"",
    ""moengage_integration_id"": ""{{integration_id}}"",
    ""add_users"": [
      {
        ""moengage_distinct_id"": <moengage_user_id>,
        ""partner_user_id"": ""{{uid99}}""
      },
      {
        ""moengage_distinct_id"": <moengage_user_id>,
        ""partner_user_id"": ""{{uid00}}""
      }
    ],
    ""remove_users"": [
      {
        ""moengage_distinct_id"": <moengage_user_id>,
        ""partner_user_id"": ""{{uid98}}""
      },
      {
        ""moengage_distinct_id"": <moengage_user_id>,
        ""partner_user_id"": ""{{uid01}}""
      }
    ]
  }
}

 

info	

Note

While testing the connection, the endpoint should return a 2xx code for success.
The response header from the destination should have content-type application/json.
For complete API reference of the SDK, refer to the docs in this link.
Total pages - It defines the number of pages in the “Synced Segment” page which consists of all the previously synced segments.
Page count - Page count denotes the page from which the data is currently shown in the payload

.

Definition of IDs in the above payload
“moengage_sync_id"": It is a unique ID given to the sync started for a particular segment, which will differentiate it from other synced segments
“moengage_sync_name”: It is the name of the segment that is being synced
“moengage_execution_id"": A unique ID will be assigned to the sync execution to differentiate that sync from multiple syncs which is possible for a particular segment
“moengage_integration_id"": This ID is generated when a segment is mapped to a particular integration destination. Thus, the mapping of the segment with the integration destination denotes the moengage_integration_id
“moengage_distinct_id”: It is a unique ID assigned to a user by the MoEngage system. This is different from the ID that the customer/partner has assigned to the user
“partner_user_id"": This is a unique ID that the customer/partner sends through their system to MoEngage so that they can identify the user as per their conventions
Structure for Key-Value pair

Payload should contain the structure when a key Value pair is added.

curl --location --request POST
''
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
--data-raw '{

Error Descriptions
Sr. No	Error	Description
1	(attr_name} Type {datatype} attribute not found	This error will be shown when the attribute is not present in the system and the user is trying to perform operations using a foreign attribute
2	Exhausted max retries for the segment	3 API call retries are possible where the frequency is 1 retry/3 seconds. If this limit is reached, the system will show the following error
3	An error occurred. Please try again or contact support.	

This error might occur if the API call fails multiple times and if the retry is attempted within 30 minutes.

 
Setting up a segment sync

Now that you have already configured your destination platform, you can get started setting up a segment sync.

To set up a new synced segment:

Step 1: Choose a custom segment to sync

In the Segment -> All segments page, select a Custom Segment and click on the action Sync Segment in the action dropdown. 

Step 2: Choose the destination

The destinations configured in Custom Destinations in App Marketplace will be available in the dropdown. Choose the destination from the available options or add a new destination for sync.

Step 3: Choose a schedule of sync and set up notification preferences

The sync can be either a one-time transfer of the users in a segment to the destination or a continuous periodic update of the latest status of the segment.

If periodic, segments can be synced daily, weekly, and monthly. Hourly syncs can be enabled on a case-by-case basis. Please connect with your account manager to enable hourly syncs for your account. 

You can also set up email ids to receive notifications of the following:

Any update in the sync configuration
Successful execution of sync
Failure of sync
info	

Note

1. There is a cool-off period set in the outbound sync process. The cool-off period is defined to avoid any interruption to the already running segment sync. For eg: If the value of any attribute is changed in the middle of segment sync, it may affect the ongoing sync. Also, the changes made to the value of any attribute will not be reflected immediately while the sync is in process. It will reflect after 30 minutes from the time the changes were made.

2. The Outbound Segment Sync default limit is as follows:

The ""active"" segment sync limit is 10. The various status of outbound segment sync are active, paused, inactive, and failed.
You can create 10 segment syncs per day. If the active segment sync limit is reached, you cannot create more segment syncs
The segment sync-resync per day limit is 20
These limits are configurable. To change the limits, you can the MoEngage Support team.

To contact the MoEngage Support team, you can raise a ticket through the Support Web Form within the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer here.
 

Periodic Outbound Segment Sync

In periodic outbound segment sync, MoEngage will send the entire users in the segment only in the first sync. For the subsequent syncs, MoEngage follows the change data capture process, where we compare the previous sync to the current status of the segment and send only the difference in the users.

This difference is sent in two lists - add_users (which contains the list of users to be added to the segment) and remove_users (which contains the list of users to be removed from the segment). This difference is also maintained by MoEngage for the action Resync Last Difference, which syncs only the last difference to the destination. This option is provided to address any data discrepancy at the destination.

View All Outbound Synced Segments

You can view the list of synced segments in the All Segments → Synced Segments tab. Sync details such as the segment name, latest sync status, destination, schedule, last sync timestamp, and the actions that can be performed on the sync are available on this page.

Actions on Outbound Synced Segments
Action	Description


View

	

Clicking on View will redirect to the selected synced segment’s detail page.




Edit

	
The Edit action will open the sync's configuration page with options to edit the destination, schedule of sync, and notification preferences that were set earlier.

If a sync is scheduled periodically, the sync frequency can be changed within the periodic options - daily, weekly, and monthly. A one-time sync cannot be changed to periodic sync and vice versa.

The end date of a sync schedule can be edited for periodic syncs.

If the start date of a sync has been crossed, it cannot be edited.

The edit option is available for synced segments that are in active, paused, and failed statuses as detailed here.



Run Adhoc Sync

	
Clicking on run ad-hoc sync will manually run the sync to the specified destination on demand.
The run ad-hoc sync action will send the latest status of users in the selected segment to the destination.
The run ad-hoc sync option is available for synced segments that are in active, paused, and failed statuses as detailed here.



Pause Sync

	

Pausing a sync will pause all further syncs of the selected segment. The history of previous syncs is maintained in that synced segment's detail pages.

Running a sync (Run ad-hoc sync action) will resume the sync of the selected segment.

The pause sync option is available for synced segments that are in active and failed statuses as detailed here.



Resync All Users

	

Choosing to allow resync all users while setting up an Integration will enable the action on each synced segment.

In case of any issue with a particular sync, your destination might hold incorrect users in the segment. To maintain the accurate state of the users in a segment, you have the option of resyncing all users in the segment.
Please ensure that the destination should be able to drop all users in the segment and allow the resync of the entire segment once again.



Resync Last Difference

	
To maintain the accurate state of the users in a segment, you can also resync only the last difference of the selected segment to the specified destination.
This option is available only to those synced segments that are in the failed status.



Archive Sync

	

Clicking on archive sync will stop all further syncs of the segment. A synced segment, once archived, cannot be unarchived.

Sync Status

Each synced segment can be in either one of the following 5 statuses:

Status	Description


Active

	

The latest execution of the sync was successful, and the sync has not expired yet, ie. the end date of the sync has not been reached yet.




Paused

	

The sync has been paused manually by clicking on the Pause action. Clicking on Run Adhoc Sync will resume all upcoming syncs of that segment. 




Failed

	There was a failure in the last run/execution of the sync. All future syncs will be paused if a sync is in a failed state. You can run the sync manually (Run Adhoc Sync) to restart the schedule. 


Inactive

	

The end time for the sync, as mentioned, has been reached.

Inactive syncs will be archived automatically after 30 days.

Syncing segments from one MoEngage App to another

Using Outbound Segment Sync and our Cohort Sync API, you can sync segments from one MoEngage App to another. This helps cross-regional teams to function synchronously and have better targeting.

Step 1: Login to your source App

To get started, log in to the app you want to send segments from (source). Ensure that Outbound Segment Sync is already enabled in this app.

Step 2: Create a new Custom Destination

To set up a new custom destination, go to the App Marketplace and navigate to the Custom Destinations section. Add a new custom destination called ""MoEngage"".

Step 3: Create a new endpoint

In the newly created Custom Destination, click on ""+ Add integration"" to configure a new endpoint. Give your endpoint a name like your destination app name. Follow the other fields as described - 

Field	Value	Description


Request Method

	

POST

	

 




URL endpoint

	

https://api-0X.moengage.com/v1/integrations/cohortsync

	

The 'X' in the API Endpoint URL refers to the MoEngage Data Center (DC). MoEngage hosts each customer in a different DC. You can find your DC number (value of X) and replace the value of 'X' in the URL by referring to the DC and API endpoint mapping here.




Parameters

	

Leave empty.

	

 




Authentication

	

Basic Auth

	

Username: This is your destination MoEngage Workspace ID.

Password: This is your destination MoEngage App's Data API Key.




Headers

	
MOE-APPKEY - This is your destination MoEngage Workspace ID.
MOE-DESTINATION-PARTNER - moengage
	

These two headers are mandatory.




User identifier

	 	

Select your user identifier. This should be the same for both the source and destination Apps.




Destination identifier

	uid	

Select the destination identifier as ""uid"" to send segments to another MoEngage app.

Once the above fields are configured, you can test the connection. If all your details are correct, then the test should be successful. Save the integration.

Step 4: Sync a segment to your destination App

Follow the details above to sync your segments to your destination App.

 

info	

Note

When syncing segments from one MoEngage App to another, you have to ensure that the users exist in both the source and the destination Apps.
Ensure that the identifier of the users is the same across both apps.
Currently, it is not possible to sync anonymous users using this method.
It is also possible to sync segments across regions.
View Details of an Outbound Synced Segment

Clicking on the synced segment name or View action, you will be redirected to the details page of that synced segment.

Sync details such as destination, schedule, latest sync status, sync updated by, updated time, sync schedule, last synced time, next sync time, and a link to the parent custom segment will be available on the detail page.

Sync configurations such as the synced user attribute, sync schedule, and notification preferences are also available on the detail page. 

You can perform all actions associated with a sync from this page - Edit, Run Adhoc Sync, Pause sync, Resync All Users, Resync Last Difference, and Archive sync.

On the details page of a synced segment, you can also view the Sync history of all the sync executions performed for this segment.

Sync History

The sync history shows the details of each time the segment has been synced to the destination at the scheduled frequency.

Run time - The time at which the sync was executed
Status of execution - Each sync execution can be in one of the following statuses -
 Complete - The sync ran successfully, and all rows have been sent to the required destination
 Processing - The sync is currently running to the required destination
 Failed - There was a failure in the execution of the sync.
No. of users added - Count of users with <synced user attribute> added to the custom segment since the last time the sync was processed. This list of users is synced to the destination under 'add_users' in the Request Body.
No. of users removed - Count of users with <synced user attribute> removed from the custom segment since the last time the sync was processed. This list of users is synced to the destination under 'remove_users' in the Request Body.
Total no. of users - This is the number of users with <synced user attribute> present in the parent custom segment.
info	

Note

You can sync one user attribute from a custom segment to a destination. You can also create up to five syncs daily and maintain up to 5 active syncs in your DB. You can also run up to five syncs daily (either by running the syncs ad-hoc or running resyncs). The above limits are customizable. Please contact your account manager to get them customized as per your requirements.
It will take approximately an hour for archived syncs to show up on the Archived Syncs page.
Please be careful while Editing, Renaming, and Archiving a Custom segment in case one or more syncs exist for the same. When the parent custom segment is renamed, the sync name does not reflect the new name of its parent custom segment. 
The user count in the custom segment may not always match the users synced from the custom segment to the destination. For example, let's say the count of users in a custom segment is 100, and the sync attribute chosen is the email id. Now assuming email id exists for 90 out of the 100 users in the custom segment, these 90 users will be synced to the destination.
FAQs
Can we remove the 30-minute cool-off period?
 - No, the 30-minute cool-off period cannot be removed. To avoid any interruption to the ongoing sync and avoid chances of incorrect data sync, as a precautionary measure, the cool-off period is set by default.


What does 'API already failed' mean?
 - This error will be shown if the API call is failed but still, a reattempt is made to make the API call. Some possible reasons for the “API already failed” error are:
Network connectivity issues: The API call could have failed because there was an issue with network connectivity, such as a weak signal or a server that is down.
Lack of authorization or authentication: The API call requires some form of authorization or authentication from the client side, and this could have been missing or invalidated, leading to the API failing.
Server Overloading: Too many requests are being handled by the server, causing the server to become overloaded and unable to handle further requests, which could result in an API failure.
Can I change the Sync name to a name of my choice?
 - No, currently there is no provision to edit/change the Sync name
What happens if the Segment name is edited midway, would the name get updated in the API call? and what if another segment of the same name is created? will both the API calls have the same sync name?
 - It is not recommended to perform any kind of action on the segment while sync is going on. It might lead to an interruption in the sync. Meanwhile, any changes made to the segment midway through the sync, the change will not reflect immediately. It will reflect after the cool-off period of 30 minutes. Please be careful while Editing, Renaming, and Archiving a segment in case one or more syncs exist for the same. When the parent custom segment is renamed, the sync name does not reflect the new name of its parent custom segment.
Can I pass more than 1 attribute in Segment sync?
 - No, as per the current MoEngage system, it is not possible to pass more than one attribute in a Segment sync.
Can I personalize the KV pair or have a dynamic timestamp?
 - Customers can personalize the KV (Key-Value) pair to their specific needs. However, please note that at this time dynamic Key Value is not supported, e.g. dynamic timestamp is not supported. Key value pairs need to be static.
What is the retrial mechanism and what is the timeout period?
 - The retrial mechanism allows the customer/partner’s system to call MoEngage APIs in multiple attempts. However, there is a limit assigned to the retrial mechanism. In total 3 retry attempts can be made with the maximum frequency/timeout being 1 retry/3 seconds."

Personal Data or Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Personal Data or Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
What is Personal Data or PII?

PII or Personally Identifiable Information is any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person.

An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Examples of personal data include name, residential address, date of birth, IP address, etc.

Organizations can use PII to identify, contact, or locate a user or person of interest as per the agreed business purpose. Any operation or set of operations that are performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction is called as ‘Processing of Personal data’.

The Data Controller is the entity that decides the means and ways to process personal data. MoEngage acts as a Data Controller when it processes its employee data as the employer decides the means and purpose of processing.

The Data Processor is the entity that processes personal data on behalf of the Data controller. MoEngage acts as a Data Processor when it assists our customers in processing personal data of their end users as a part of providing services for use cases decided by the Data Controller (Our Customers).

While certain personal data fields like zip code, date of birth, gender, and passwords may not independently identify an individual, they become PII when combined with other personal data fields that, collectively, can uniquely identify a living person.

Safeguarding PII at MoEngage

MoEngage provides three options for safeguarding PII data. These options cater to different business and operational requirements. You can select the most suitable approach for your needs: Data Masking, Data Encryption, and/or tokenization.

Sending PII to MoEngage

If you choose to send PII to MoEngage, you can utilize the following functionalities to safeguard the data:

PII Masking
MoEngage allows you to designate specific attributes as PII and mask them to ensure security. Only administrators have access to view and download this data. For more information, see PII Masking.
PII Data Encryption
MoEngage provides the capability to encrypt PII data stored within its systems. Any user or event attributes marked as PII can be encrypted. By default, encrypted attributes also have masking enabled. These attributes are not visible or downloadable from the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, see PII Data Encryption.
Not Sending PII to MoEngage

If you decide not to send PII to MoEngage, you can leverage the following functionality to enable your workflows:

PII Tokenized Sending
To ensure complete user anonymity, MoEngage supports tokenized sending. This approach fetches PII data at runtime, eliminating the need to store it within MoEngage. For more information, see PII Tokenized Sending."

PII Data Encryption

MoEngage allows the encryption of user and event attributes marked as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Any attribute with data encryption enabled will also have masking enabled by default. Such attributes are not shown on and cannot be downloaded from the MoEngage dashboard.

Enabling PII Data Encryption

You can enable data encryption for all user and event attributes except a list of reserved ones that cannot be encrypted. For more information, refer to the list of reserved attributes for which data encryption is not supported.

info	

Note

Please make sure you mark the attribute as ""encrypted"" using test values before sending the majority (or actual) data. It is important to note that any data received after the attribute is marked as encrypted will itself be encrypted during storage, while the data received before it will remain unchanged.
Attributes marked as encrypted once cannot be de-encrypted or unmasked.
Users with Admin roles can see the attributes in their encrypted form. User with other roles cannot see the encrypted attributes (they are locked in the user profile, reporting, analytics, and segmentation screens).
Once encryption is turned on, it may take up to fifteen minutes for the new settings to get reflected.
An encrypted attribute can only be exported in reports if you have admin access. The attribute will be exported in its encrypted format.
User Attributes
Event Attributes

To enable PII Data Encryption for a user attribute, follow these steps:

Personal Data or Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
PII Tokenized Sending
Overview
info	

Note

PII tokenization sending is a unique offering of MoEngage, which has been patented (in progress).

PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data can be classified as follows from a campaign standpoint:

Customer contact details required to send the campaign to customers like their Email ID, Mobile number
Customer information is required for personalizing the campaign content, like the customer's first name, last name, and so on.

Tokenization is the process of replacing sensitive information elements with non-sensitive ones, called tokens, to ensure data security. The PII - Tokenized Sending feature is a set of configurations that ensure that your end customers remain completely anonymous in the MoEngage database. This is done by assigning an anonymous ID to every customer so that their identity is protected. This feature aims to provide an option to engage customers without storing any personal or restricted data in MoEngage. Thus, you can continue segmenting, personalizing, and engaging (sending campaigns) your customers without storing the customer's PII data in the MoEngage Databases.

MoEngage complies with GDPR and data masking. For more information, refer to GDPR and PII Masking.

info	

Note

PII Tokenized Sending is a paid feature. Please connect with the MoEngage support team to enable it for your account.

Prerequisites
PII API configuration: You must configure the PII API on the MoEngage dashboard. This is required to fetch the contact information for customers while sending campaigns using the unique customer identifier stored in MoEngage.
Availability of anonymous ID in your DB: You must maintain a unique anonymized customer identifier in your DB. This anonymous ID will be the shared common identifier for the customer between your system and MoEngage.
Configuration

You can configure your PII API in the MoEngage dashboard to fetch the Email ID/Mobile Number of the customer while sending the campaign.

info	

Note

PII Tokenized Sending is supported for the following channels and partners: SMS & RCS, Email, WhatsApp
MoEngage uses dynamic IPs for sending messages, if you want to use static IPs refer to this doc to know more.
When PII Tokenized Sending is enabled, Frequency Capping is not supported for the Email channel. However, it is supported for the SMS & RCS and WhatsApp channels.
When PII Tokenized Sending is enabled, the following are not supported:
Opt-out Management (WhatsApp)
Subscription Management (SMS)
Message Archival
Email Settings
SMS & RCS Settings
WhatsApp Settings

If you classify customers' Email IDs as PII and don't want to store them in MoEngage, you can go to the Email settings and configure it as described below.

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard > Settings > Channels > Email.
Click the Data tab. Select the option from where you would like to pick the Customer's Email address in the Customer's email address data field. There are two options:
Customer's email addresses are stored in MoEngage DB
Customer's email addresses are not stored in MoEngage DB (Fetch via API)
By default, this is set to pick up the email ID from the MoEngage standard Email attribute: Email (Standard). You can change the option to Fetch via API. Once this option is selected, the API settings can be entered in the UI, as shown below.
Provide the API details from where MoEngage should retrieve the customer's email address during runtime (when sending a particular campaign to which the customer is eligible). 

API configuration

Method: Select the GET or POST method.
Request URL: Type or paste the ""Request URL"" of the API.
Parameters: Type or paste the relevant ""URL parameters"", ""Headers"" &/or ""Body"" details for the API as the key-value pairs. 
info	

Note

 

The API request parameters must contain the personalized user attribute that is the unique customer identifier for MoEngage and your customer database where customer details are stored.

Testing the API
 Next, the chosen personalized parameter will be available for you to pass a test value and check the API response.
Enter the test value.
Press the ""Test"" button. This will call the API and the API response parameters will dynamically get populated in the Email address field in the API response field.
Choosing the API response parameter, which contains the email address
Once the test is successful, the ""Email Address field in API response"" field will get enabled.   
From the drop-down in the ""Email Address field in API response"" field, select the API response parameter, which contains the customers' email addresses.
Save the configuration.

 

Steps Involved in PII-based Campaign Sending

For the campaign sending flow, we assume that the prerequisites for PII settings are configured. 

Email/SMS & RCS/WhatsApp campaign is triggered by a user event or is scheduled at a specific time.
MoEngage calls your GET API configured in the settings and passes the anonymized customer ID for each eligible customer for the campaign.
Your API retrieves the mapped Email/Mobile Number and sends it back to MoEngage.
The campaign-sending process begins by calling your Email/SMS & RCS/WhatsApp service provider with your Email ID/Mobile Number and other message details. MoEngage deletes the Email ID/Mobile number & other PII data (like First name, and last name retrieved via Content-API for the specific campaign) as soon as it is shared with the configured Email/SMS/RCS service provider.
The Email/SMS/RCS/WhatsApp is sent to the customer by your ESP/SSP partner.
The Email /SMS/RCS/WhatsApp service provider shares the message delivery details with MoEngage.
MoEngage maps the delivery data back to the campaign using the message ID and deletes the Mobile Number/Email ID just in case it is returned as part of the delivery data.
The delivery status and corresponding metrics are shown in the Campaign Analytics section of the respective campaign on the MoEngage dashboard.

Note:  Personalization information like name can be fetched from your database using ""Content API"". For more information, refer to Personalization using Content APIs.

Anonymization Support

Here are a few other changes implemented to support customer anonymity in the MoEngage platform.

Campaign Sending Logs - If Tokenized Sending has been configured for a specific channel, the logs for the campaign will stop storing email/mobile number data (depending on the channel for which PII Tokenized Sending is configured) from the next instance of the campaign run (post the configuration change).

Campaign Delivery data - Delivery data is tracked by MoEngage for all the native connectors, and MoEngage maps the delivery data back to a campaign using the message ID field.

info	

Information

Delivery information is not tracked for custom (SMS & RCS and Email) connectors.

Segmentation - The 'show count' query will list the user count as part of both Segmentation from the Segment-> Create Segment navigations and Segmentation in campaigns. However, the reachable user count cannot be shown in both cases as MoEngage does not store the mobile number or email address (which is the basis for computing reachability).

Current campaigns (live campaigns) - If there are any live campaigns for that channel (point channel or flows) when the PII API settings are configured, sending will be done by fetching the Email ID / Mobile number from the very next instance.

Personalized Preview - The personalized preview feature will be disabled automatically after the PII settings are saved for a particular channel. However, it is to be noted that ""personalized preview"" is an independent feature and can be enabled back for the channel based on explicit consent shared by you with your CSM (Customer Success Manager).

Campaign Testing Failure Reason - While testing a campaign when the campaign is being created (for the channel where PII configuration is set), if the API fails to respond, the API error will be shown in the UI.

Campaign Analytics - The customers for whom the PII API configured above fails to retrieve the customer sending ID (Email ID / mobile number) will not be counted in the Campaign delivery stats in the Campaign Info/Analytics section. This is because this funnel accounts for users with a valid Email ID / Mobile number.

Content Personalization when customer data is not available in MoEngage - While the PII API above focuses on retrieving the customer's sending ID (Email ID / Mobile number), MoEngage's Content API feature allows you to fetch any data (PII and/or other) directly from your database in real-time when the campaign is about to be sent to the end customer. Click here for more information about Content APIs. 

Frequently Asked Questions
1. Do you need a tokenization server to create an anonymous ID?

No. A separate tokenization server is not required for generating an anonymous ID.

2. Can Content API and Sending-ID solutions work independently?

Yes. Both are independent features; many of our customers use Content API alone to personalize campaign content using Content API. Similarly, the Email/Mobile number tokenization can also work without Content API configured or used in a campaign.

3. What happens to active campaigns that are in progress if I change the settings now?

All the campaigns for the specific channel (for which you have just saved the settings), including the currently active campaigns, will fetch the Email ID/Mobile Number via the API rather than the value stored in MoEngage. If, for a few end-customers, the campaigns have already been triggered to the configured Email / SMS & RCS / WhatsApp provider; they might receive the campaign with the data stored in MoEngage.

4. What happens to draft/scheduled campaigns activated after changing these settings?

The draft campaigns will also use the PII API as soon as they are published or triggered next.

5. What happens to data retrieved in real-time from my customer's database?

It is shared with your Email / SMS & RCS / WhatsApp service provider and deleted afterward.

6. Does the log contain the PII thus retrieved via API?

For the channel where you have saved the setting to retrieve data via PII API, MoEngage will stop storing the Email ID and/or mobile number in the logs. The logs will have the unique customer identifier (or the tokenized identifier) that is common across MoEngage and your customer database.

7. Are these settings applicable for Flows as well?

Yes. For example, suppose the email settings are configured to fetch Email ID via API rather than using the value stored in MoEngage. In that case, both the individual email campaigns and email campaigns that are part of the flows will start using the API to fetch the customer's email ID rather than relying on the email attribute in MoEngage DB.

8. Does MoEngage offer PII masking?

Yes, please take a look at our PII masking solution here.

9. Does MoEngage Inform support PII tokenized sending?

No, currently, we do not support PII tokenized sending in MoEngage Inform.

10. How does MoEngage handle retries if the PII API does not respond? Is the entire batch considered to have failed or is the failure marked only for users for whom the PII API did not respond?

MoEngage retires for a maximum of three times with a time interval of two sec for each retry. In the case of failure, the entire batch is not retried. Retries happen only for those users for whom the PII API did not respond.

11. Does the PII API also have the send and throttle speed as email batching?

Yes, the send and throttle speed of the PII API is the same as that of email batching.

12. Can I encrypt my PII data?

Yes, MoEngage supports symmetric key encryption. You can encrypt the payload sent from the API using symmetric key encryption. The PII value will be decrypted only at the time of sending the campaign.

13. What error does MoEngage display in the error breakdown section of campaign analytics in case of a failure due to PII API not being responsive?

PII Masking on Personalised Preview
Overview

The PII masking feature enables organizations to protect sensitive information by masking personally identifiable information (PII) fields in campaign previews. This ensures that PII data, such as user and event attributes, are not exposed on the UI, aligning with privacy standards.

You can use the Personalized Preview feature to validate content and test personalization without compromising customer data privacy. Fields marked as PII within the data management or Content API are masked, typically displayed as “XXXX” on the UI, while non-PII fields remain visible in plain text.

This feature enhances data privacy, prevents unauthorized PII exposure, and supports secure campaign testing.

info	

Information

This feature is applicable to all channels that support personalization preview.

Use Cases

Following are some of the use cases for the PII masking feature:

If you want to test personalization in a campaign preview, PII masking hides sensitive information while displaying non-PII fields in plain text. This allows accurate content validation without revealing PII data.
 If you need to fetch data from the Content API for campaign content, any fields marked as PII are automatically masked, preventing unauthorized access in UI previews and maintaining data privacy.
If certain roles do not have permission to view PII, PII masking enforces privacy by masking PII fields in the personalized preview, ensuring that only authorized roles can access sensitive information.
If you need to use the Personalized Preview to check rendering of content, PII masking safeguards customer data by masking sensitive information while allowing non-PII details to appear in plain text. This supports effective preview and testing without privacy risks.
Masked Attributes in Personalization Content

The PII masking feature ensures that user attributes, such as mobile number and last name, are visible only to administrators. For all other users, these attributes are displayed as “private.”

With this feature, you can mask PII fields in the user profile as well as in the personalized content.

With this update, any user or event attribute marked for masking also appears masked in personalization content. This applies to all channels that support personalization preview, ensuring masked values are consistently protected across the platform.

Masked Attributes in Content API

When adding a content API, you may receive PII in the response. This feature allows you to mask specific values in the API response to prevent unauthorized access to PII.

To do the same, perform the following steps:

On the Content API page, under the Actions column, click the ellipsis icon and then select Edit. For more information on creating personalized campaigns using content APIs, refer to Content APIs.

On the Edit Content API page, click Yes under Mask PII fields.
In the Select fields to mask list, select the fields you want to mask. For example, in the following image, we have selected coord. lon, coord.lat, and click Done.

Upon using this content API for personalizing content, the values of the selected fields in the previous step are masked.

info	

Information

Field values are masked as ""xxx."" Any operations using these fields also use the ""xxx"" value, not the original value fetched from the user profile."

Privacy
CCPA
What Is CCPA?

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is California’s privacy law aimed at enhancing consumer privacy rights for residents of California, United States. The law became fully enforceable on July 1st, 2020.

Who Is Affected by CCPA?

Under the CCPA, businesses that earn $50,000,000 a year in revenue, sell 100,000 consumers' records each year, or derive 50% of their annual revenue by selling your personal information (PI) must comply. All businesses must comply if they collect or sell Californians' personal information, whether they are located in California, a different state, or even a different country.

Key Facts of CCPA

The following are the key facts of the CCPA:

Own Your Personal Information
Right to Know What Personal Information Is Being Collected

As a consumer, you have the right to request the business that collects your personal information to disclose to you the categories of personal information that it has collected about you.

Right to Know Whether Personal Information Is Sold or Disclosed and to Whom

As a consumer, you have the right to request that the business that sells your personal information or discloses it for a business purpose, to disclose to you:

The personal information that is sold to third parties and the identity of such third parties
The personal information that is disclosed for a business purpose to third parties and the identity of such third parties
Control Your Personal Information

If you do not want a corporation to sell your information, you can stop them by clicking the do not sell my data link.  The corporation cannot hide this in a privacy policy—they have to display it clearly at the bottom of any page where they collect your information. If you tell them not to sell your info, they cannot discriminate against you. This means they cannot charge you more, deny you access to services, or change the quality of the service you get.

Secure Your Personal Information

A business that owns, licenses, or maintains personal information about a Californian resident needs to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information. The business needs to protect the personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.

Hold Big Corporations Accountable

Under the CCPA, only businesses that earn $50,000,000 a year in revenue, sell 100,000 consumer records each year, or derive 50% of their annual revenue by selling your personal information must comply. Such businesses must comply if they collect or sell Californians' personal information, whether they are located in California, a different state, or even a different country.

How Is Personal Information Defined Under the CCPA

The CCPA defines “personal information” as any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.

The CCPA documentation provides specific examples of personal data. The list includes, but is not limited to, the following identifiers:

Identifiers such as a real name, alias, address, email address, social security number, license number, passport number, or similar identifiers.
Commercial information including property records, product purchases, and other consumer histories and tendencies.
Biometric data such as fingerprints and facial recognition data.
Internet or network activity data, such as IP addresses, browsing history, search history, and interactions with online sites or advertisements.
MoEngage Compliance with CCPA
Right to Know What Personal Information Is Being Collected

You can accomplish user data retrieval in several ways:

The Get User API of MoEngage provides all collected data for the specified users. For more information, refer to Get User API.
You can export user data from MoEngage. Navigate to the Segmentation module on the MoEngage dashboard and download the data as required. For more information, refer to User Data Exports.
You can also reach out to our Support Team for a copy of all data we have for any user. You must raise a support request. For more information, refer to Raise a Support Ticket Through MoEngage Dashboard.
Right to Know Whether Personal Information Is Sold or Disclosed and to Whom

We only send the information to the following third-party platforms if you have opted in for MoEngage email or SMS sending:

Email Connector (Sendgrid or any other as per the client setup)
SMS Connector or Service Provider (Gupshup or any other as per the client setup)

For more information on this, refer to privacy policy.

Right to Say No to the Sale or Disclosure of Personal Information

We do not sell personal information at all. If a user requests to opt-out of data processing, you can do so by following the SDK methods listed in our integration documents:
Android | iOS | Web

Data Deletion

You can delete the data of your users when required. To do this, we have hosted the GDPR/CCPA API that removes all personal data associated with specific users who have requested their data to be erased from MoEngage. For more information, refer to GDPR/CCPA API.

The API accepts one of the following parameters as input:

ID (required for logged-in users)
Email
Mobile Number
GAID (required for anonymous users)
IDFA (required for anonymous users)

Removing a user’s personal data erases their personal data from MoEngage. To maintain the integrity of campaign and application usage analytics, anonymous aggregated data is not modified when an end user is removed (for example, MoEngage does not decrement an app’s MAU numbers or Campaign Stats when an end user is deleted). However, this data is not connected in any way to the profile of the forgotten end user, ensuring that this anonymized and aggregated data cannot be tied back to any individual user.

After the API request is made to remove personal data for specific users, it takes a maximum of 7 days for completing this request. It may, however, take 60 days to remove this data from all our logs and backups. We need to maintain the data for 60 days to justify our processing of erasure requests of personal data related to every user.

CCPA and GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all activities involved in the processing of personal data—including storing, accessing, and transferring data. The CCPA, however, only applies to the collection, sale, and disclosure of personal information for business purposes."

Privacy
GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal data of individuals who live in the European Union (EU). This regulation aims to provide users complete control over their data.

MoEngage complies with the guidelines mentioned in the GDPR and has built industry-standard APIs and SDKs, which enable you to easily respond to the requests raised by individual users.

This article details the rights users have under the GDPR and recommendations on how to comply with each of these rights while using MoEngage.

Right To Erasure
What Is It?

The ""Right to Erasure"" allows data subjects to delete all information that you have about them from your servers and the servers of your data processors such as MoEngage.

How to Implement It?

To comply with this right, we have hosted the GDPR/CCPA API that removes all personal data associated with specific users who have requested their data to be erased from MoEngage. For more information, refer to GDPR/CCPA API.

The API accepts one of the following parameters as input:

ID (required for logged-in users)
Email
Mobile Number
GAID (required for anonymous users)
IDFA (required for anonymous users)

Removing a user’s personal data erases their personal data from MoEngage. To maintain the integrity of campaign and application usage analytics, anonymous aggregated data is not modified when an end user is removed (for example, MoEngage does not decrement an app’s MAU numbers or Campaign Stats when an end user is deleted). However, this data is not connected in any way to the profile of the forgotten end user, ensuring that this anonymized and aggregated data cannot be tied back to any individual user.

After the API request is made to remove personal data for specific users, it takes a maximum of 7 days for completing this request. It may, however, take 60 days to remove this data from all our logs and backups. We need to maintain the data for 60 days to justify our processing of erasure requests of personal data related to every user.

For more information on the GDPR erase API, refer to GDPR/CCPA API.

Right to Access
What Is It?

The data subject under the GDPR has the right to Confirmation that the users' data being processed, access to their data, and other supplementary information largely correspond to the information that must be provided in a privacy notice (see GDPR Article 15).

How to Implement It?

You can export user data from MoEngage. Navigate to the Segmentation module on the MoEngage dashboard and download the data as required. For more information, refer to User Data Exports.

MoEngage also hosts an API that returns all the personal data associated with specific users (who have requested data access from MoEngage). For more information, refer to Get User API.

Right to Rectification
What Is It?

Data subjects, under GDPR, are entitled to have personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete. If you have disclosed the personal data in question to third parties, you must inform them of the rectification where possible.

How to Implement It?

MoEngage customers can update the data of specific users in MoEngage by using one of our Data Import APIs. These are enabled for all clients by default and can be used whenever an end-user requests for their information to be updated. For information on MoEngage Data Import API and how to update user data in MoEngage, refer here.

Right to Data Portability
What Is It?

The right to data portability allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data across different services.

How to Implement It?

Similar to Right to Access, MoEngage customers can easily download data of specific users based on any user identifier. MoEngage dashboard users with Admin and Manager access can download user data directly from the dashboard. For more information, refer to User Data Exports.

You can also use the Get User API of MoEngage to request data about specific users. For more information, refer to Get User API.

Right to Restriction of Processing
What Is It?

Data subjects have the right to block or suppress the processing of specific subsets of their personal data in the event of inaccurate or improperly obtained data. When processing is restricted, you are permitted to store the personal data, but not further process it. You can retain just enough information about the individual to ensure that the restriction is respected in the future.

How to Implement It?

To comply with the data tracking opt-out requests of users under the ""Right To Restriction of Processing"" of GDPR, our SDKs have the methods to opt-out of data tracking.

For information on leveraging the capabilities of our SDKs to restrict data processing, refer to:

ANDROID | iOS | Web

After the data processing is stopped from the SDK, it does not track any events except the ones which can be tracked anonymously such as: 

Push (Notification Received Android, Notification Clicked Android, Notification Swiped Android)
iOS Push (Notification Sent iOS, Notification Clicked iOS)
Web Push (Notification Received Web, Notification Clicked Web)
In-App (InApp Shown Android, InApp Clicked Android, InApp Closed Android, App Rated)
In-App (InApp Shown iOS, InApp Clicked iOS, InApp Closed iOS, App Rated)
Anonymous lifecycle events (MOE_APP_EXIT, TOKEN_EVENT, App/Site Opened, Viewed Web Page)
Stats events (NOTIFICATION_OFFLINE_MOE,DT_CAMPAIGN_SCHEDULED, EVENT_ACTION_COPY_COUPON_CODE)

Remember the following points when implementing the data tracking opt-out methods of our SDK:

Opting out of data tracking does not ensure the erasure of data. To restrict the processing of data and also erase it completely, make the erase API request separately.
Opting out of data tracking does not ensure that push notifications are not sent. To suppress push notifications on devices/users, refer to Opt Out of Campaign Messages.
Right to Object
What Is It?

Data Subjects have the right to object to the processing of their personal data at any time. This effectively allows individuals to stop or prevent you from processing their personal data.

How to Implement It?

If one of your users invokes their right to object to the processing of personal data, you must restrict the processing of their personal data by following the steps mentioned under the ""Right to Restriction of Processing"" section of this article.

You must erase the personal data of this user by following the steps mentioned under the ""Right to Erasure"" section of this article.

Right to Be Informed
What Is It?

Data subjects have the right to be informed about what you do with their personal data.

How to Implement It?

When a user is signing up to use your app or website and before you actually capture their personal data, you must inform them how you are going to use their personal information. You must ask your users before sending them marketing communication such as push notifications, emails, SMS and also inform how you plan to use their personal data if for something else.

MoEngage uses the personal data of your data subjects responsibly and removes it when no longer necessary. You can refer to our privacy policy to know more about how we process the data of your end users.

Opt Out of Campaign Messages

Under the GDPR, you must take consent from your users before sending them Push notifications, SMS, or any other message. If you want to restrict messages for a few users or devices automatically, we recommend the following options:

Using Preference Management

You can take the push permission from every user and set it as a user attribute. After this is done, you can exclude the users who have opted out of push notifications from campaign segmentation. For more information, refer to Preference Management.

Using SDK Methods for Blocking Push Notifications and In-Apps

The MoEngage SDKs allow you to restrict push notifications and In-App messaging on specific devices. If a user, while signing up on your app does not provide consent for sending push notifications and/or In-App messages, you can restrict these from the SDK directly. Refer to the following SDK documentation for more information on opting out of Push notifications and in-app or On-site messaging.

Apple Privacy Manifest Update
Overview

At WWDC23, Apple introduced new privacy manifests and signatures for SDKs to help app developers better understand how third-party SDKs use data, secure software dependencies, and provide additional privacy protection for users.

Starting May 1st 2024, if your new app or app update submission adds a third-party SDK that is commonly used in apps on the App Store, you must include the privacy manifest for the SDK.

Signatures are also required when you use the SDK as a binary dependency. This functionality is a step forward for all apps, and we encourage all SDKs to adopt it to better support the apps that depend on them. For more information, refer to the official announcement from Apple.

How Does MoEngage Comply with this?

This section describes how MoEngage complies with the new privacy manifests and signatures for SDKs.

Privacy Manifest

The Privacy Manifest is a file that describes the specific privacy practices and data collection activities of an iOS app. It provides essential information to users about how their personal data is collected, used, and shared by the app. This is a requirement by Apple for developers to ensure transparency and allow users to make informed decisions about their privacy. It includes details on the types of data collected (such as personal information, location, browsing history), how the data is used, and whether it is shared with third parties.

Based on the documentation from Apple, ""Third-party SDKs need to provide their own privacy manifest files that record the types of data they collect. Your app’s privacy manifest file doesn’t need to cover data collected by third-party SDKs that your app links to.""

MoEngage iOS SDK decrales the following data.

NSPrivacyCollected
DataType	NSPrivacyCollected

Precise location	Analytics, Product personalization, App functionality	-	MoEngageGeofence
Coarse location	Analytics, Product personalization, App functionality	-	MoEngageGeofence
Code Signing

When you add third-party binary SDKs to your target as XCFrameworks, the behavior of those packages becomes part of the behavior of your product. An attacker who can inject a compromised version of the SDK into your project can change your app’s behavior and cause security and privacy issues for your developers, testers, and people who use your product. To avoid those, we have code-signed all the MoEngage frameworks.

Which SDK versions support the Apple Privacy Manifest?

To comply with the policy, you must upgrade your iOS app with the latest MoEngage SDK.

MoEngage SDKs core version 9.16.2 and above is compliant with the guidelines from Apple and the following data is declared from the Privacy manifests. For Hybrid frameworks, below are the modules associated with SDKs core version 9.16.2

MoEngage React Native SDK: 9.0.0
MoEngage Flutter SDK: 7.0.0
MoEngage Cordova SDK: 8.6.0
MoEngage Capacitor SDK: 3.3.0
MoEngage Unity SDK: 3.2.0
By When Should I Upgrade My App?

 Apple documentation mentions the following:

Starting March 13: If you upload a new or updated app to App Store Connect that uses an API requiring approved reasons, we’ll send you an email letting you know if you’re missing reasons in your app’s privacy manifest. This is in addition to the existing notification in App Store Connect.

Starting May 1: You’ll need to include approved reasons for the listed APIs used by your app’s code to upload a new or updated app to App Store Connect. If you’re not using an API for an allowed reason, please find an alternative. And if you add a new third-party SDK that’s on the list of commonly used third-party SDKs, these API, privacy manifest, and signature requirements will apply to that SDK. Make sure to use a version of the SDK that includes its privacy manifest and note that signatures are also required when the SDK is added as a binary dependency.

Therefore, we strongly recommend updating the MoEngage iOS SDK with your next app update. Otherwise, your next app update may get rejected.

However, you do not need to rush an app upgrade only to comply with the requirements.

What will happen to my current app users?

This change only affects App versions published on or after May 1, 2024. Users on App versions published before this will not be affected including new installs and reinstalls."

Android Advertising ID Tracking
Overview

As part of the Google User Data policy update in April 2022, the advertising identifier may not be connected to persistent device identifiers (for example, SSAID, MAC address, IMEI, and so on) for any advertising purpose. The advertising identifier may only be connected to personally-identifiable information with the explicit consent from the user.

MoEngage complies with the guidelines mentioned in the Google Play Developer Program Policy and has built industry-standard APIs in the SDKs that enable you to opt-in for personalization using advertising ID only after explicit consent from the user.

The details about the data privacy requirements stated in Google Play Developer Program policies and recommendations on how to comply with them while using MoEngage are described in this article. Using these policies keeps your app in good standing on Google Play and keeps your users protected.

What Is the Policy?

The Android Advertising ID (AAID) or Google Advertising Identifier (GAID) is a unique, user-resettable ID for advertising, provided by Google Play services. As part of the Google Play services update in April 2022, the advertising identifier can be connected to personally-identifiable information or associated with any persistent device identifier only after taking explicit consent from the user. 

info	

Information

The best practices for working with Android identifiers mention that you connect the advertising identifier to personally-identifiable information only after taking explicit consent from the user. 

All Android apps listed on the Google Play store are affected. If you are generating persistent device identifiers and mapping them with AAID and not taking adequate consent from the user in accordance with the User Data policy depending on your data requirements and user flows, Google Play Console does not allow you to post new versions of your app from August 2022 end.

How Does It Affect Your App?

MoEngage SDK uses a Device ID (persistent device identifier) to uniquely identify the user to deliver personalized content and associates this to AAID if allowed by the app. 

AAID is one of the device attributes used by MoEngage to improve:

Accurate identification of reachable devices for sending Push notifications. If the user opts out of AAID tracking, this may lead to an increased number of users reachable using Push notifications.
Tracking re-installs for users over time. If the user opts out of AAID tracking, this may lead to re-installs being tracked as new installs.

If AAID is passed to MoEngage SDK without proper consent, you may receive this warning from the Google Play team.

Email Message

Your app includes SDK com.moengage:moe-android-sdk or an SDK that one of your libraries depends on, which collects personal or sensitive data that includes but is not limited to Advertising ID identifiers that may not be linked to other personal and sensitive user data or resettable device identifiers as described in the User Device policy.

This is only a warning and has no impact on your app’s User experience or its Play Store listing till the end of August 2022. We've seen our customers getting different dates; please check the email you've received from Google for the exact date for your app. You can take this time to ensure compliance with the Google Play store guidelines by implementing the solutions recommended below. 

Enable Advertising ID Tracking with MoEngage SDK
For MoEngage SDK versions 12.2.01 and later

With Android SDK version 12.2.01 released in April 2022, we have added the required APIs and support for enabling tracking of the specified identifiers only after the user’s consent. For more information, refer to Enabling Advertising ID tracking.

The Google Play team has reviewed and approved MoEngage SDK version 12.2.01.

For support on other frameworks apart from Android native, we would provide similar methods to enable tracking AAID with our new SDK versions on these frameworks planned to be released by 31st July 2022.

For MoEngage SDK versions 12.0.00 and earlier

MoEngage SDK versions 12.0.00 and lower track advertising identifiers by default and map them against the persistent identifiers. The mapping is according to the latest User Data Policy.

MoEngage strongly recommends that you update to the latest version for ease of opt-in and opt-out of tracking AAID.

What if I cannot Update the SDK to the Latest Version Right Now?

If you receive a warning and cannot immediately upgrade your MoEngage SDK and enable opt-in tracking properly, you can opt-out of tracking device identifiers on MoEngage SDK while initializing the SDK. To enable tracking again after taking the consent from the user, you need to re-initialize the SDK with the required configurations. For more information, refer to the developer documentation.

This is not a recommended method as this requires reinitializing MoEngage SDK and any previous initialization configurations is discarded.

In addition to this, if there are any other queries around Google Play user data policies, you can reach out to your MoEngage Customer Success Manager or raise a support ticket.

Why Are Location Values Not Updated on the User Profile?
Problem

Location details such as City, State, and Country passed through Server-to-Server API (S2S API) or Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) imports are not updated on the user profile in the MoEngage dashboard.

Explanation
Internal attributes:
Location attributes (city, state, and country) are internal attributes derived from the user’s IP address during an SDK call triggered by the App/Site opened event.
These attributes are managed by the SDK to avoid potential conflicts and inconsistencies.
Update restrictions:
These attributes cannot be updated through:
File imports (S3)
S2S API calls (v1/customer and v1/transition)
Updates attempted through these methods may be overridden by SDK updates, making debugging difficult for large user bases.
User creation behavior:
These attributes are supported during the user creation process but remain unmodifiable afterward through non-SDK sources.
The values can be updated only after the SDK call occurs.
SDK integration alternatives:
If SDK integration is not planned, use custom user attributes to store and manage location details.
This avoids conflicts with the internal attributes tracked by the SDK."

Why Is the User Import Status Showing as 'Processing'?
Problem

The user import status is stuck in the Processing state, but no actual processing occurs.

Solution

Perform the following steps:

Check import details:
Log in to the MoEngage dashboard and review the import status details.
Imports often show as Processing or Pending.
Rate limits and multiple uploads:
This issue can occur if multiple files are uploaded within the same hour.
Files are processed based on the available rate limits per hour and per day. These limits can be checked on the import page (If your rate limits have been upgraded, contact your account manager or customer success manager to confirm the rate limits). 
Pending State:
If the file remains stuck in the Processing state, it is likely in a Pending state.
The file will update once the rate limits are refreshed and processing resumes.
Check back later: 
You can revisit the import page later to confirm the imports have been completed."

Why Is an Anonymous User Profile Created with an Uninstall Event Linked to a Campaign ID?
Problem

An anonymous user profile is created containing only an uninstall event. It contains no actual user information and does not map to a registered profile.

Solution

Perform the following steps:

Expand the uninstall event in the Activity info to check for campaign details. 
Locate the Campaign ID associated with this event. 
Search for the Campaign ID in the dashboard. 
If the campaign was scheduled for All Users, it indicates that the user had uninstalled the application before the campaign could be delivered.

Since MoEngage did not receive the proper uninstall callback for this user, a guest profile was created to track this uninstall event. This process ensures that the uninstall event is recorded, even without mapping it to a registered user profile."

How To Verify User Deletion in MoEngage?

This article explains how to verify whether a user has been successfully deleted from the MoEngage system using the Delete User API. Since the deletion process takes up to 24 hours, ensure the required waiting period has passed before proceeding with the verification steps. 

Instructions
Wait for 24 hours: 
Ensure at least 24 hours have passed since submitting the delete user API request. The deletion process requires this amount of time to complete.
Check the segmentation search dashboard:
Obtain the Unique ID or User ID of the deleted user.
Go to Segment > Create segment in the MoEngage dashboard.
Use the search bar in the upper right corner to search for the user.
Perform the search using the Unique ID or User ID: 
If the search results display the user's details, the deletion has not been completed.
If the search results are empty, the user has been successfully removed.
Use the Get User API:
Make an API call using the Get User API as specified in the MoEnage Get User API documentation.
In the API response: 
Look for the users_not_found field:
If present and contains the user's details, this confirms the user has been deleted 
If not present, check the user's field for the user's information.

What Is the Importance of the MoEngage API Key, and What Happens if It Is Updated?
Problem

The significance and potential impact of updating the MoEngage API key for the apps on Android and iOS platforms on MoEngage need to be addressed. The MoEngage API key can be found on the dashboard under the Settings > APIs section, as shown in the screenshot. 

Solution

To successfully update the MoEngage API key and address potential impacts, follow these steps:

Immediate changes: The API key can be regenerated and saved at any time. 
Navigate to Settings > API in the MoEngage dashboard to regenerate the API key.
Support for old and new API keys:  
Once a new API key is regenerated, the old key will immediately become invalid.
MoEngage does not support simultaneous usage of old and new API keys.
Implementation updates:  
The old API key must be replaced with the new one in all implementation areas.
The Workspace ID (earlier app id) will remain the same during this process.
Risk of data loss: 
Failing to update the new API key across all required locations may lead to data loss. Ensure proper implementation to avoid disruption.

Why Is the New Data Type Not Reflecting in Data Management?
Problem

The Data management section does not reflect newly updated data types for user or event attributes. Segmentation still uses the old data type.

Solution

Perform the following steps:

Update the data type: Go to Settings > Data management, edit the user or event attributes and update the desired new data type.
Send test values: Update the attribute values for a specific test user to send sample values with the new data type to a test user profile.
Verify reflection: After MoEngage processes values in the new data type, the updated type will be reflected in the Data management dashboard, as well as in Segmentation and throughout the system.

What Are the Key Points of the MoEngage Data Tracking Policy?

This article explains the key points of the MoEngage data tracking policy. These policies help you make the necessary adjustments during the initial implementation stages.

Instructions
MoEngage accepts the following datatypes for attributes:
Integer, Float, Double, Long, Boolean, String, Datetime, Array<Long>, Array<Int>, Array<Double>, Array<Short>, Array<Float>, Array<String>, Object, Array of Objects.
Each array element can be a maximum of 512 characters, with up to 50 elements in each array.
Attribute values sent as dictionary data types will be rejected.
For attributes of the datetime data type,
When sending data through MoEngage Data APIs, use the ISO 8601 date format (for example, 2020-05-31T16:33:35Z).
When sending data through SDK, use the SDK's date functions.
If an attribute value is a URL and exceeds the 512-character limit, it will be rejected to prevent issues with image and URL personalization.
Arrays must be homogeneous (all values in an array must be of the same datatype). Data typecasting is supported at the array level.
Event names used with periods create an additional space. For example, event.name will be ingested as event. Name (with a space). It is recommended to use “_"" (hyphens) instead of ""."" (period).
You can create up to 100 unique event attributes for a single event.
The following table lists the limit values for events and attribute names:

Key	Character Limit	Limit Breach Handling
Event name length	200	Store the first 200 characters only.
User attribute name length	200	Store the first 200 characters only.
User attribute value length	512	Store the first 512 characters only.
Event attribute name length	200	Store the first 200 characters only.
Event attribute value length	512	Store the first 512 characters only.

FAQs - Data
Why Is Domain Whitelisting Recommended Over IP Whitelisting for the Data API?
Problem

It is recommended that the domain for the Data application programming interface (API) be whitelisted instead of the IP.

info	

Information

The need to enable network address translation (NAT) IP forwarding for specific User API and Event API requests may arise, potentially because of errors like a time-out error, network error, and so on.

Explanation
MoEngage uses a multi-tenant system, meaning IPs change frequently to support scale and security.
The domain api-xx.moengage.com is static, making domain whitelisting more reliable than IP whitelisting.
MoEngage APIs use Authentication to validate requests and ensure security.
If static IPs are required, a custom implementation at MoEngage is required, which is typically avoided.
Do not cache the IP. If you encounter any errors in the response from MoEngage, domain whitelisting should suffice."

If the Encrypt attribute setting is turned on, the Mask attribute setting is enabled automatically. You cannot turn the Mask attribute off.
If the Encrypt attribute setting is turned off, the Mask attribute setting is turned off by default. You can choose to turn the Mask attribute setting on or off independently.
If only the Mask attribute setting is turned on, the data is masked but not encrypted.

Basics of Segmentation
Overview

Segmentation is the process of creating a subset/group of users having similar properties/behavior from the total user base. Segments can be based on similar user attributes, events, event attributes, or a combination of all.

MoEngage Segmentation allows you to build groups of users who share common attributes (for example, location) or have the same behavior pattern (for example., users who read an article). A user segment is built using a combination of filters based on Events and attributes.

With the use of Segmentation in MoEngage, one can analyze behavioral traits or send personalized campaigns effectively.

Prerequisites

Before you start with segmentation, do ensure that MoEngage SDK integration and Event tracking is completed for your app/website. More details on integration in our documentation.

Key Concepts

These are the key concepts that one should know before doing the segmentation - 

User attributes and User activity (Events and Event attributes) are the building blocks of segmentation.
Filters are used to filter specific user attributes and events.
Joins to combine multiple segment blocks.
User Attributes

User attributes are properties of a user in the MoEngage system, such as email, name, last location, etc. The value of user attributes gets updated almost in real-time and the latest values are available for calculation.

Examples of segments based on user attributes can be:

Users whose Last known country is ‘India’
Users who have Unsubscribed from email
Users who have Reachability Push iOS as true

User attributes have the latest value and do not have historical data on the attribute.

Some of these user attributes are generated by MoEngage and most of these user attributes are passed by the client systems to MoEngage. Know more about MoEngage-generated user attributes.

Event & Event Attributes

Events are activities done by users such as App Open, Add to Cart, Product Purchase, Loan availed, etc. The properties related to these events are called event attributes. These events can be performed multiple times.

The examples for event attribute categories are App version, platform name, product category, product price, etc.

Examples of segments based on event attributes can be:

Users who have placed order at least 3 times in the last 90 days with the category “sportswear”
Here, the event is placed order and the event attribute can be the size, color of the sportswear.
Users who have viewed page at least 5 times in the last 30 days, with the category “laptop”
Here, the event is viewed page and the event attribute can be screen size, price, etc of the laptop.
Users who have added to cart at least 1 times in the last 30 days, with the category “mobiles”
Here, the event is added to cart and the event attribute can be the model, storage, etc of the mobile phone.

Some of these events are generated by MoEngage and most of these events are passed by the client systems to MoEngage. Know more about MoEngage-generated events & event attributes.

Filters

Filters are the logical conditions by which specific user attribute values or event attribute values are filtered. For example, filters allow you to select users from the city of London or users who have purchased shirts in the last 30 days.

Know more about filters in detail.

Joins

All segments or segment blocks are joined using AND, OR, and Exclude conditions.
OR - Combining the two Segment blocks.
AND - Take the intersection of the two Segment blocks. 
Exclude - Remove the intersection of the two Segment blocks from one block"

Segmentation
Types of Segments
Overview

MoEngage dashboard enables growth teams to create multiple kinds of segments. MoEngage has the following types of segments:

Static / File Segments
Rule / Filter-based Segments
Custom Segments
Static / File Segment

Static segments are fixed groups of users and are used as a list of users. When a list of users is manually uploaded on MoEngage to create a segment, it is called a file segment or static segment. Learn more about File Segments in this article.

Rule / Filter-Based Segment

Rule-based segments are based on user attributes and user activity. These segments are created using rules and criteria based on user attributes or properties, events or event properties, or a combination of attributes and events. The rules or criteria are executed on the existing data to provide a group of users. Learn more about creating rule-based segments combining other segments here.

Custom Segment

The custom segment is a construct to use multiple segments as one segment and easily use it in the workflows. Custom segments are a combination of static segments, rule-based segments, and other custom segments. 


Segment processing for different campaign types

Firstly, all the event processing in MoEngage happens in real time. MoEngage has the most advanced segmentation engine, with querying speed in seconds, supporting segmentation on all event properties and configurable multi-year lookback.

Computation of segments for One-time and Periodic campaigns/flows happens at the scheduled time of campaign execution itself, in seconds.

For Event Triggered campaigns/flows, segment membership can be defined in the Trigger criteria (where you can define multiple events and their properties with action / in-action filters), user properties, and past behavior segmentation and the details of the processing for those are explained below:

Trigger Criteria

This event processing layer qualifies the users in real-time based on their actions/inaction. You can include criteria for use cases like cart abandonment (user added the product to the cart, but didn't purchase in 30 mins), within the trigger criteria itself.

User Properties

User property qualification for segment membership within Event Triggered campaigns, happens in real time.

Past behavior segmentation
Real-Time Segment Evaluation

Past behavior segments that utilize data within the last 30 days are evaluated in real-time. Segments that use the User Attributes, User Events, Event attributes, and Event duration within 30 days are evaluated in real-time.

Real-time segment evaluation is available for Push (Event-triggered), Email (Event-triggered), SMS (Event-triggered), WhatsApp (Event-triggered), In-Apps, OSM (On-Site Messaging), and Flows channels. It will be rolled out soon for the remaining advertising channels.

Real-time segment evaluation within Event Triggered campaigns is an exclusive and proprietary solution developed by MoEngage. MoEngage has also secured a patent for this innovative technology

Precomputed Segments

MoEngage doesn't want to limit you to segmentation use cases only for 30 days. Hence, we offer pre-computed segments.

Past behavior segments are based on historical event data beyond 30 days (like users who have an affinity towards a given category of products based on the last 120 days' purchase data), and certain segmentation filters are pre-computed. Segment membership doesn’t change for these cohorts typically at the time of the event trigger, giving you users a real-time experience.

Any segmentation criteria that need to be evaluated in real time can be added to the Trigger Criteria. Depending on the campaign type, the frequency of pre-computing can vary from 30 minutes to a few hours and is configurable."

All Segments

The All Segments page provides a unified view of all custom segments created and used in MoEngage. This enables growth teams to quickly get an overview of their custom segments in one place and perform actions on them. They can also navigate to the detail page of each custom segment from the All Segments page. If Teams are enabled for your account, the custom segments created for all the teams (to which you have access) will be displayed. To see the custom segments created for a specific team,  select the team in the All Segments for dropdown list.

All Segments

This page lists all the custom segments, showing the Custom Segment name, Segment Type (file segment or filter segment), Segment created time, Segment last run time (time at which the segment was the last run in a query or a campaign), and actions that can be performed on a custom segment.

Clicking on the Custom segment name will lead the marketer to that segment’s detail page.

You can sort the table by any of the columns in ascending or descending order. By default, the table is sorted in descending order of the last run time. 

You can search for a segment by entering the desired segment name in the search box.

Segments can also be filtered by Segment Type - either File or Filter segments.

1. File Segment - These are custom segments that are created when growth teams upload a list of users. You can import a list of users containing one of the User Attributes that identifies a unique user, and a custom segment of these users gets created. Learn more about file segments in this article. 

2. Filter Segment - These are custom segments that are created from the MoEngage dashboard. Growth teams can create rules and criteria to define a user segment. The rules and criteria can be applied to user attributes/properties, events & event properties, and a combination of the two. Learn more about filter segments here.

Clicking on +Segment opens a panel that redirects to the Create Segment page (to create a filter segment), the RFM segment page, and the Create File Segment popup (to create a file segment). If Teams are enabled, and you are a part of multiple teams, you will need to select a team from the Teams dropdown before clicking + Segment.

Segment Edit History

The Segment Edit History section on the Segment Details page is based on the Segment Type of the chosen segment. 

File Segment Edit History

The Edit history for file segments shows the following columns - Segment Edited on (time of edit), Operation (Add, Remove, Replace users), Status of Operation, and details of the file processed.

The Status of the Operation can have the following values:

Pending: Pending file segments are yet to be processed as there is already another file in the processing queue.
Processing: These file segments are currently being processed by the system. 
Successful: File segments are processed successfully and their attributes are updated.
Failed: File segments that have failed while processing. On hovering over this status, you will be able to view the reason for failure as well.

Details of the file processed:

Attribute name: This column shows the user attribute uploaded in the file along with its data type.

Valid attributes: This indicates the number of records that were successfully processed in the file uploaded.

Users resolved: This indicates the number of existing users updated with the user attribute provided in the file. These users then become part of the custom segment.

Invalid attributes: This indicates the number of records in the file that failed during processing.

By default, this table is ordered in the ‘Segment edited on’ column, showing the latest edit first. You should be able to see the last 20 edits in the edit history of the file segment.

Filter Segment Edit History

The Edit History for filter segments shows the following columns - Segment edited on(time of edit), Segment description, and Option (Use this version).

You can click on Use this version on an older version of the segment, to update the current segment definition to the chosen version. Refresh the segment count to get the latest user count and reachability of the edited segment.

Segmentation
Create Segments

A segment is a group of users defined by specific properties, values, or rules. Segments can be used to send campaigns or to analyze specific information or behavioral traits of users.

This article helps growth teams with segment definitions such as - Users who have opened the app in the last 30 days or Users whose Location is New York AND have executed Purchase at least 3 times in the last 30 days. Hence whenever this segment executes, all the users who fulfill the criteria become part of the segment.

After creating a user segment, follow it up with creating a campaign to target these users. Learn more about creating campaigns in this article. 

MoEngage dashboard enables growth teams to create multiple types of segments, such as Static Segments, Rule Based Segments, Custom Segments & Live Segments. Know more about the types of segments.

This document explains Rule Based Segments in detail and how to combine them with other types of segments.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Before you start with segmentation, do ensure that MoEngage SDK integration and Event tracking is completed for your app/website. More details on integration in our documentation.

Rule Based Segments

On the MoEngage dashboard, growth teams can create rules and criteria to define a user segment. The rules and criteria can be applied to user attributes/properties, events & event properties, and a combination of the two.

User properties are attributes of the user in the MoEngage system such as email, name, last location, etc. The value of user properties gets updated almost in real time and the latest values are available for calculation.
Events are activities done by users such as App Open, Product Purchase, etc. These events also have event attributes such as app version, platform name, product category, product price, etc. Event attributes are tracked with events and are specific to the selected event.

Creating Rule-Based Segments

To create a Rule-Based Segment, click on Segment on the sidebar and then click on Create Segments. This lands on the Create Segments page.




Use User Properties

Select the User Property section then:

Select desired user property and filter conditions.
Provide the filter value/s to create a rule.

The description for the selected user property appears in the right section of the dropdown.

Use Event and Event Properties

Select the User Behavior section then  -

Select the execution condition and the desired user activity (event)
Provide event frequency and time duration for the event execution
Add Event attribute with a filter condition
Provide the filter value/s to create a rule.

The description for the selected event appears in the right section of the dropdown.





info	

Information

MoEngage generates a few default user properties, events, and event attributes. A list of all derived events and attributes can be found in this article.
The analysis of segments is performed based on server time for all of the time-bound analyses. For more information about server time, refer to Event Time and Server Time.
Use User Affinity

Affinity Segments are groups of users created based on the user performing an action with a specific attribute value.
User affinity is explained in detail in this article.

Select the User Affinity section then  -

Select the desired user activity (event)
Select the user affinity parameter from - Predominantly, Minimum of, Most no. of times, and Least no. of times.
For Predominantly & Minimum of, select affinity attribute with a filter condition and provide the affinity value/s.
For Most no. of times & Least no. of times, provide top/bottom percentage of users
Provide time duration for the event execution
Add Event attribute with a filter condition and provide the filter value/s to create a rule.



Use Custom Segment

Select the Custom Segment section, then select the desired custom segment to create a rule.
Custom Segments are explained in detail in this article.

The description for the selected custom segment appears below the custom segment selection dropdown.

Teams in Segments

If teams are enabled for your account, you will be able to create segments for them by selecting the team from the Teams dropdown. Every team has a segment criteria specified for it during its creation. This condition gets added with an AND condition to segments created. For example, if you create a custom segment as a set of users whose last known city is Los Angeles and the segmentation criteria for your team is frequent buyers (users who have purchased products more than ten times in the last seven days), your custom segment will comprise frequent buyers whose last known city is Los Angeles. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage.

Note

When Teams are enabled:

The User Affinity filter will not be available in the Filter users by section.
The Select a segment dropdown in the Custom segment filter section lists only the custom segments that are associated with the selected team.

 	

Beta Callout

MoEngage Teams with the Segmentation Filters is a Beta feature. To get it enabled for your account, reach out to your CSM.

Combining Segments

Multiple User Property rules, User activity rules, User Affinity rules, and Custom Segments can be combined using AND, OR and Exclude conditions to create a robust and complex user segment. 

With Nested AND/OR capabilities, along with (A AND B AND C AND D) and (A OR B OR C OR D) type of segments, complex segments such as the following can be created:

(A AND B) OR (C AND D)
(A OR B) AND (C OR D)
(A OR B) AND C AND D
(A AND B) OR C OR D

Use the 'Add Nested Filter' button to add a nested block (Event block - Event with all its filters. Nested block - Multiple nested event blocks)

The nested condition is preselected, opposite to the outer condition. If the outer condition is AND, the nested condition will be OR and vice-versa. By default, the nested condition is OR and the Outer condition is AND. 

Both the nested as well as the outer conditions can be changed. When the outer condition is changed (let's say, from AND to OR), the nested condition automatically gets updated to the opposite condition (in this case, AND) and vice versa. 

Nested AND/OR functionalities are available in segmentation as well as campaign creation pages in the target audience section. They are not supported in Trigger Criteria in Event-triggered campaigns.

A particular user segment can also be excluded from the selected user segment, to use this click on Exclude user checkbox.

Segmentation
Affinity Segments

Affinity Segments allow you to choose and target your users based on their personalities, lifestyles, beliefs, and choices (as displayed within your app). This will help you optimize your campaigns by sending them messaging that addresses their needs. 

With Affinity Segments, you can analyze personality traits to understand your users better. For example, you can:

View users who listen to Madonna’s albums more often than any others, so you can recommend a similar album
Filter users who book cab rides from your app between 10 AM to 12 PM at least 40% of the time, so you can send more coupons to them around that time period
Find the bottom 20% of users who book hotels on a weekday, and send them discounts to incentivize weekend bookings
View the top 10% of users who read political news to recommend better articles for them on your app

Affinity Segments help you filter user traits, positive or negative, and use the data to send campaigns that are more likely to resonate with them. 

To create an Affinity Segment,

Navigate to MoEngage Dashboard > Segment on the sidebar
Click on Create Segments.
The Create Segments page is displayed.




Click User Affinity and select the event from the drop-down list.
From the drop-down list, select one of the following affinity filters:
Predominantly
For more information, refer to Predominantly.
Minimum of
For more information, refer to Minimum of.

Most no. of times
For more information, refer to Top users or Bottom users.

Least no. of times
For more information, refer to Top users or Bottom users.

Select the attributes used with the affinity filter.
Click Show Count to show the count of users in the affinity segment.
Affinity Filters
Predominantly

Any user that performs a certain action (from the selected attribute values) more times than all other attribute values is said to perform the action predominantly. 

For instance, a user has bought 10 books through your e-commerce app, out of which 5 are thrillers, 3 are biographies, and 2 are self-help. In this case, the predominant genre is thrillers. Another user, who has purchased 25 books, could have 15 books in the thriller genre, 4 biographies, and 6 self-help. In this case, too, the predominant genre is thrillers, even though the minimum number of books purchased varies.

The ‘Predominantly’ filter helps you segment your users based on fluid filters that realistically reflect your users’ actions. 

To set up the ‘predominantly’ filter: 

In the User affinity tab select event
Select predominantly, then select attribute and filter condition
Select the value that should be predominant.

For example, the event is Song Played, the attribute name is Artist Name and Rihanna is the value. The users who have played songs of Rihanna predominantly in all of their songs are listed.

You can choose multiple affinity attributes for an action, and all of them combined will be considered to be one value, based on which predominance will be calculated. 

Let’s take a music streaming app, for example: Along with listing the number of users who listen to a particular artist name (Rihanna), you can also select the platform from which it is played (Android). So the artist + platform is combined into a single value (Rihanna_Android) which shows users who predominantly display the attribute value over all other values (Rihanna_iOS, BTS_Android, and so on).

Normal event attribute filters can be used to filter out the desired events. On the filtered events, the Predominantly calculation is performed.

Here are some instances where you can use the Predominance filter across industries:

Filter out users that purchase more T-Shirts compared to other apparel.

Find users who predominantly transact more than a threshold amount on your payment platform every week compared to other transaction values.

View users who predominantly purchase groceries between the 1st to 5th of the month, compared to all other grocery orders during the month.

View the users who predominantly order desserts on Saturday evenings compared to other days of the week.
Minimum of

Segment users based on them performing an action at least x% of times compared to all other actions— this is called the “Minimum of” filter. 

For example, if you want to send coupons to users who watch movies on your streaming platform—but only to users who watch RomComs at least 25% of the time. 

The number of movies played is different for different users, but with the ‘Minimum of’ filter, you can select users who have played RomComs for at least a select percentage of the time.  

To segment users who have executed an action (event) at least for a set percentage of times with an attribute value: 

In the User affinity tab, select event, then select For a minimum of & percentage
Select attribute and filter condition
Select the value that should be a minimum of the attribute

For example, the event is Song Played, the attribute name is Artist Name is Enrique and the minimum value is 25% of the time. The users who have played songs of Enrique at least 25% of the time in all of their songs are listed.

In the example, along with the genre (RomCom), the Day of the Week (Monday) is also selected. The movie genre + Day of the Week is a single value (RomCom_Monday) and is a minimum set percent across all other values (Thriller_Tuesday, Drama_Wednesday, Horror_Monday, Animated_Tuesday, and so on.)

You can choose multiple affinity attributes for an action, and all of them combined will be considered to be one value based on which ‘Minimum of’ is calculated.

You can further filter these results to reflect app version, gender, location, etc.

The ‘Minimum of’ filter is applicable in the following scenarios:

Users who book cab rides from 10 AM to 12 PM at least 60% of the time compared to other hours of the day.
Users who make at least 20% of transactions worth more than a threshold amount in a week compared to other transactions.
Users whose grocery purchases occur between the 1st and 5th of a month at least 70% of the time compared to other days.
Users who buy dessert on a Saturday at least 50% of the time compared to other days of the week.
info	

Note

Affinity Attributes (predominantly & Minimum of attributes) only support string and double data types. Affinity Attributes do not support array data types.

Top Users and Bottom Users

Filter the users who are performing an action most no. of times or least number of times. The top or bottom users are determined by the number of times they perform that action when compared to other users. 

For example, you can segment the top 10% of users who book cabs through your app or choose the least 20% who book cabs and send targeted campaigns accordingly. 

To segment users who are in the top or bottom percentages of the users and execute an action or event:

In the User affinity tab, select event, then select Most no. of times or Least no. of times.
Type the percentage value.

You can further filter these results to reflect app version, date, location, etc. The top or bottom users are determined based on the filtered events.

Filtering your users based on Affinity Segments will help you set up more targeted and personalized campaigns that convert better and align your messaging according to your customer's preferences."

Segmentation
File Segments

Growth teams often perform their custom analysis on the users and user data. Post the analysis, growth teams would want to use these users in a campaign or perform further analysis.

These users can be uploaded to MoEnage and used as the File Segment. The File Segment is a list of users. File Segment can be used for MoEngage campaigns or Analytics.

File Segments provide flexibility to create and target user segments that you may have identified through some user analysis at your end. You can import a list of users containing one of the User Attributes that identifies a unique user, and a custom segment of these users gets created.

Create a File Segment

Step 1:

Navigate to MoEngage Dashboard > Segment > All Segments > +Segment > File Segment

Step 2: 

Provide a Custom segment name and description. 
Select the file which has the user list. You can either upload a CSV or provide a URL to the same. 
Select the User Attribute that your list is using. For example, if you have a list of the Driving IDs of your users, select Driving ID from the user attribute dropdown.
Provide one or more email IDs where MoEngage can inform, once the custom segment is created.

Note: If you don't see the segment after receiving the email, please refresh the page and search.

 

warning	

A user attribute value must uniquely identify a single user. If an attribute value identifies multiple users (e.g. a city attribute with the value 'London' may have many users) these multiple users may get mapped to a single attribute, become part of the segment, and may block other users from being included in the segment.

For example, you upload 5 emails, and the first email matches with 3 users (A, B, and C), and the remaining 4 emails match with one user each (D, E, F, and G). In this case, the system will randomly pick 5 users to be added to the file segment.

The system does the processing in batches of 2,000 attribute values and add maximum of 2,000 users into file segment for each batch. Even with fewer user attribute values, more users could be added to the file segment. For example if 1500 user attribute values results into 2500 users, system will randomly add 2000 of these 2500 users into the file segment.

File Format

Please check your file before uploading it to MoEngage systems. Ensure that - 

The file does not have duplicate values,
The file does not have special characters,
The file does not have double quotes,
The file does not have empty rows or empty columns
It should be a CSV file with a single column containing the user attribute.
The file size should not be more than 64 MB.

Custom Segment Availability

As soon as the MoEngage system receives the File Segment request, it creates the custom segment. After creating a custom segment, the system processes the users and adds those users to the custom segment.
Hence custom segment is available when the file is processing and also if the file processing is failed. When the File Segment is processed, its status (either completed or failed) is communicated through an email.

In case the file upload/processing has failed, you can upload the file again using the same custom segment name. The system will add the new user to the provided custom segment. This functionality also enables adding new users to any existing file custom segment.

Status and Warnings for File Segment Processing

To prevent issues arising from using file segments before they are fully processed, MoEngage provides warnings in the UI. These warnings help you understand if a segment is still being processed and when it's advisable to use it.


info	

Information

You will see these warnings on the following pages:

Create segment page
Target audience sections on all the campaign creation pages
Target audience sections on analytics pages
Warnings During Segment Usage

When you select a file segment that is still being processed for use in creating another segment, while targeting a campaign, or in analytics, a warning message will be displayed. The warning is displayed based on the following conditions:

If a single selected segment is being processed: ""Users are being updated in this segment - <Custom Segment name>. We suggest that you wait until the confirmation email is received to use this segment in a campaign. Keep an eye here for the latest update.""
If segments nested in another segment are processing: ""Users are being updated in these segments - <Custom Segment 1, Custom Segment 2, Custom Segment 3 names>. These segments are nested in the parent segment chosen. We suggest that you wait until the confirmation email is received to use the segment in a campaign. Keep an eye here for the latest update.""

Refresh the page or choose the segment again to see its latest status. This warning will no longer appear after the last file in the queue is successfully processed.

Warning in the Segment Detail Page

If you navigate to the detail page of a custom segment that is currently being updated (i.e., a file upload is still processing), a warning message will be displayed as follows: ""Users are being updated in this segment - <CS name linked>. We suggest that you wait until the confirmation email is received to use this segment in a campaign. Keep an eye here for the latest update.""

Refresh the page to see the segment's latest status. This warning will no longer appear after the file processing is successfully completed.

User Availability

File Segments can only have users that are present in MoEngage. If you upload a user, who is not present in MoEngage systems, that user is not processed and can not be part of the File Segment.

To upload new users into the MoEngage and create a File Segment of those users, refer to Import Users.

The total number of users uploaded via the File segment is limited to 2 million per day.
(This limit is customizable, please get in touch with support to increase the limits.)

Edit a File Segment

Editing an existing file segment is possible via the MoEngage dashboard. On the MoEngage dashboard, you can perform the following actions on a file segment:

Add users: A new list of users can be added to an existing file segment.
Remove users: A list of users can be removed from an existing file segment.
Replace users: A list of users can be replaced in an existing file segment.

Step 1:

Navigate to the file segment that you would like to edit from the Segment > All Segments page.

Step 2:

From the Actions tab, click on the More Actions vertical ellipses and choose the Edit option.

Step 3: 

Choose the Edit action that you want to perform on the file segment among Add users, Remove users and Replace users.
Select the file which has the user list to be added, removed, or replaced. You can either upload a CSV or provide a URL to the same. 
Select the User Attribute that your list is using. For example, if you have a list of the Driving IDs of your users, select Driving ID from the user attribute dropdown.
Provide one or more email IDs where MoEngage can inform, once the custom segment is processed.

All functionalities of file segments: Create segments, Remove and Replace users from the File Segment can also be accessed using File Segment API.

Archive/Unarchive a File Segment

File Segments can be archived from the MoEngage dashboard. 

File segments that have not run (query not executed) in the last 60 days are automatically archived.
All the users from the archived File Custom Segment are dropped after 30 days of archival. Hence after 30 days of archival, the archived custom segment returns 0 users.

RFM Segments

RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) Model provides auto-segmentation and buckets users into categories such as Loyal, Promising, At Risk, etc. based on their behavior. These auto segments can be used in multiple different ways such as user analysis, churn analysis, and campaign effectiveness. RFM can also be used for predictive segmentation, customers who are more likely to respond to promotions, and also for future personalization.

RFM analysis is a widely used marketing model for behavior-based customer segmentation. This was primarily used in the retail industry and made its way into digital marketing. It groups customers based on their transaction history – how recently, how often, and how much did they buy.

RFM Analysis can be used to answer questions like - 

Who are your loyal customers?
Which are the customers who are most likely to churn?
Which customers are purchasing the most on your platform?
Which are the customers who can be turned into the best customers with little effort?
Which customers are most likely to engage with your campaigns?
RFM Segments Overview

What is RFM Analysis

RFM analysis is a customer behavior segmentation method that uses customers' past interactions such as a visit to the platform or purchase of an item and based on these interactions divides customers into different RFM groups.

The Factors for RFM Analysis

The primary factors are R, F, and M for this model, which are explained below- 
R is RECENCY - Time since the last visit to the app/site or time since the last purchase.
F is FREQUENCY - The total number of times a user has visited the app/site or the total number of purchases
M is MONETARY -  Total money spent by a user or total time spent watching content

How RFM is calculated
Value for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary

Value for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary is the exact value for a specific user, for example, the recency value is 3 days ago, the frequency value is 5 times, and the purchase value is $1523.


Scores for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary

MoEngage systems provide Recency, Frequency, and Monetary score to each user based on the value of recency, frequency, and monetary. The values are ranked from highest to lowest and a score has been provided based on the rank. A combination of all these scores is the final RFM score for a user. 

For example, consider the table given below. For users 1, 2, and 3 RFM is calculated. Recency value is ranked from highest to lowest and respective scores have been provided. The same procedure has been repeated with Frequency and Monetary scores. After getting the R score, the F score, and the M Score, the RFM score is calculated for a user.

 
User ID	R-Value	R Score	F Value	F Score	M Value	M Score	RFM Score
1	1 day ago	3	10 times	3	$1000	3	3.00
2	5 day ago	2	4 times	2	$560	3	2.34
3	9 day ago	2	1 time	1	$100	1	1.34

Segment Buckets for RFM Score 

Users who are showing similar behavior on R, F, M, and RFM scores are grouped into the same RFM buckets or segments. These segments are named with respect to user behavior. The list of segments and the respective description is provided below:

 

RFM Bucket	Description
Champions	
Users who have visited most recently, visited most frequently and spent the most.



Loyal Customers

	
Users who visited recently visited often and spent a great amount



Potential Loyalist

	
A recent user, who spent a good amount



Recent Users

	
Users visited most recently, but not often, and have not spent much



Promising

	
Average recency, frequency, and monetary scores



Needs Attention 

	
Users have spent a good amount but long ago (not visited recently)



About To Sleep 

	
Below-average recency, frequency, and monetary values



Price sensitive 

	
Users visited most recently, and also often, but have not spent much



Can’t Lose Them 

	
The user has spent a great amount and visited often but long ago (not visited recently)

The user's last visit was long back, visits are not often, and has not spent much



Lost

	
Lowest recency, frequency, and monetary scores.
 Engagement Strategies for RFM Segments

The RFM segment predicts user behavior and accordingly, marketers can take action to make the best of these user segments. Here are some basic strategies to be used for different RFM Segments:

 

RFM Bucket	

Engagement Strategy


Champions	
Reward these users. They promote your products, they can be early adopters for your new launches.



Loyal Customers

	
These users are responsive to your promotions, and you can suggest to them higher-value products. Also, ask them for reviews.



Potential Loyalist

	
Engage them with long-term offers like loyalty programs or membership rewards. Suggest other categories of products to them.



Recent Users

	
For new users, make their onboarding experience smooth and provide assistance when needed.



Promising

	
Make them loyal by creating brand awareness and giving free trials.



Needs Attention 

	
Need to bring back these customers, provide limited-period offers, and recommend products using purchase history.



About To Sleep 

	
The user will be lost if not reactivated. Recommend them popular products and provide discounts for memberships.



Price sensitive 

	
Users looking for the best deal, recommend them the highest rated products and send discount communications.



Can’t Lose Them 

	
Listen to their feedback, suggest them newer products, and make them stick to your platform.



Hibernating 

	
Recommend products for other categories and provide personalized offers.



Lost

	
Make your presence known through different campaigns.

 

Let's see how it works on the MoEngage dashboard:

RFM Events 

By default App/Site Open is selected as Recency event, Frequency event is selected as 'Same as Recency Event'. Monetary event & Revenu Attribute is default set to the Conversion Goal Event and Revenu Attribute defined in MoEngage Dashboard > Settings > APP > General.

Users can change these Recency, Frequency, and Monetary events and apply desired filters for the selected events. This helps run RFM analysis on a specific category, specific business unit, product, or service.

Accounts do have an identifier (event attribute) for different currencies. This identifier has to be used to filter the monetary events.  Needless to say, Recency and frequency events should also be of that specific market or category, or business unit for which the monetary event is being analyzed.

 

RFM Model & Duration of Analysis

MoEngage dashboard provided RF (Recency & Frequency), RM (Recency & Monetary), and FM (Frequency & Monetary) analysis model other than the default RFM model.

Users can select a desired time duration for the RFM model analysis.

The recommended analysis period is 30 days - the more the data the better. Individual users can decide the RFM model analysis duration based on their customer acquisition, activation, and retention period. RFM duration should cover all of these customer lifecycle phases if possible. In the case of retail & e-commerce, 3 month time period is an industry-standard for RFM model analysis.
RFM analysis can be performed on all data that is present in MoEngage Analytics. In most cases, the data retention is 1 year or 2 years.

 

MoEngage performs RFM analysis in real-time, hence users don’t have to configure and wait for the analysis. The time taken for the analysis is proportional to the time period and the number of data points scanned. For an account that has 45 million MAU, the RFM model takes just a few minutes to complete the analysis.

 

Understanding Charts & Tables
RFM Models

The chart represents the different RFM segments, their respective user count, and segment size as a percentage of total users in the selected time duration. The size of the segment on the chart is proportional to the user count. On chart hover, it also displays the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary score and value range (low - high) for the respective RFM segment.

Chart images can be downloaded in png format for further use.

 

RFM Table

The table represents the same data shown in the chart, in tabular format. the table shows the RFM Segment Name, Recency Score, Recency Value Range, Frequency Score, Frequency Value Range, Monetary Score, Monetary Value Range, User Count, and Percentage of Users.

Table data can be downloaded in CSV format for any further use.

If your user role doesn’t have download permission, there will not be a download CTA for the user.



Note: Overlap of users is possible in high-risk segments, such as Lost, About to Sleep, and Hibernating. The RFM segment definition for these segments is very close, which may result in certain users appearing repeatedly in these segments when run again. This can also happen due to new data coming into the RFM re-run.

It's usually on brands to connect with these users with various ways to re-engage them with their platform.

 

RFM Transition

RFM transition represents the count of users, of RFM Segments from Period 1, moving into RFM Segments of Period 2, over the Transition Duration.

Transition Duration is the time period over which users migrate from one RFM segment to another RFM segment. The time duration of the origin RFM & destination RFM remains the same.

Period 2 is what users select on the Date Range field, let's say it is x days. Hence Period 1 will also be x days. The chronology here is - Period 1: Transition Duration: Period 2.

 

There is no specific day on which users transition from one RFM segment to another. It is completely based on the whole period of analysis and relative to other users' actions.

Hovering over a segment shows - 
a. Total number is users who got into that segment and number of moved-in users as a percentage of overall user migration.
b. Total number of users moved out of that segment and number of moved-out users as a percentage of overall user migration.

 

Hovering over a transition shows - 
a. Total number is users moved from a specific segment of period 1 RFM to a specific segment of period 2 RFM.
b. It also displays the number of moved-out users as a percentage of overall user migration.

If your user role doesn’t have download permission, there will not be a download CTA for the user.

RFM Transition table shows the period 1 RFM segment names, period 2 RFM segment names, 
their respective user migration count, and percentage with respect to overall user migration.

Actionable Analytics on RFM

Users are able to create a custom segment or a campaign from RFM Chart or User Transition chart. Clicking on the chart area of the RFM segment or User Transition chord shows a popup, which let the user create a custom segment or campaign.


Creating a campaign from the RFM page on the MoEngage dashboard, the dashboard redirects to the selected campaign page with the chosen RFM or User transition segment. Users can complete the campaign creation on that page.

 

Actionable analytics on RFM creates a dynamic custom segment, which saves the RFM segment definition, not the exact users. The next time when a campaign with an RFM segment is sent, one time or periodically, that RFM segment gets calculated each of the sending times and the newly created RFM segment will be used in the campaign.

Custom segments saved from RFM analysis can be used with other segments. Other segments can have their own definition or can be fixed/uploaded as custom segments. In this way, RFM segments can be used with any other segments, which can be RFM segments uploaded by growth teams.

 

RFM Distribution

RFM Distribution charts show the distribution of users on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary parameters. Recency Distribution is a distribution of time, from the last visit to the app or time since the last purchase. Frequency Distribution is a distribution of the number of times, users have visited the app or users made purchases. Monetary Distribution is a distribution of revenue generated by reach users.

The primary use for these charts is to analyze where users are located in the distribution chart with respect to overall users. Using these charts marketers can also customize RFM Segments - using these distribution values and executing them on the segmentation page will result in the desired segment based on RFM distribution."

Custom Segments

Custom segments enable you to save user segment queries and provide a name for this query for ease of use. Now this custom segment can be used on multiple pages in the MoEngage dashboard instead of entering the entire query and creating the segment again.

Creating Custom Segment

In the MoEngage dashboard custom segments can be created in 3 ways - 

Navigate to Segment > Create Segment, after entering the query, click on the “Create” button and select Create Custom Segment. Enter the custom segment name and save the custom segment. Additionally, in the Recent Query section for a selected query click on the 'Create Custom Segment' icon. Enter the custom segment name and save the custom segment. These sections create a dynamic custom segment. This is explained in the Create User Segments article.
Custom segments can be created while importing users. The users in the segment remain fixed and hence this is a static custom segment. Click here to know more.
Custom segments can also be created from Behaviour analysis, Funnel analysis and RFM Segments. These sections create a dynamic custom segment. Click here to know more.
Using Custom Segment

On the MoEngage dashboard custom segments can be used in multiple different ways - 

Custom segments can be utilized to create a complex user segment. A custom segment can be used in creating user segments along with user properties and user activities.
A custom segment can be used while creating other custom segments, hence complex nesting of custom segments is allowed. A custom segment can have up to 3 levels of recursion/nesting i.e. Custom Segment A definition can include Segment B which in turn can include Segment C which in turn can include Segment D.
While creating/defining a new custom segment, up to 10 existing custom segments can be used in the new custom segment.
Custom Segments can be used to create a target audience while creating a campaign for different channels such as Push, Email, SMS, In-App, Facebook, Flows, etc.
Custom Segment Analysis

Users of a custom segment can be analyzed on the MoEngage Analytics pages - Behavior, Funnel, Retention, Session & Source, User Paths & RFM Segments. By default, all users are analyzed for the above-mentioned analysis. To analyze users of a specific custom segment, select the desired custom segment from the custom segment dropdown. Provide the other required parameter for the respective analysis and hit the 'Apply' button. This provides the desired analysis for a respective custom segment.

 

Archive Segment

Navigate to Segment > All Segments, enter the custom segment name that you want to Archive, and search. For the selected custom segment click on Actions -> Archive to archive the selected custom segment.

For custom segments - 

Archived custom segments are not available in the custom segments dropdown on the MoEngage dashboard. If an archived Rule/Filter-based Segment is used in the campaign, the segment gets calculated based on the rule/filters. If an archived File Segment is used in a campaign, the segment will return 0 users.
Custom segments that have not run (query not executed) in the last 60 days are automatically archived.
All the users from the archived File Custom Segment are dropped after 30 days of archival. Hence after 30 days of archival, the archived custom segment returns 0 users.
You can mark an expiry time for the file custom segments using Custom File segment API. After the expiry time, all existing users from the custom segment are dropped, and the custom segment is archived.
Custom segments cannot have the same name, even when one of the segments is archived.

 

Navigate to Segment > All Segments, and click on the 'Archived Segments' toggle to view a list of all archived segments. Search the custom segment that you want to unarchive from the list. For the selected custom segment click on the 'Unarchive' action to unarchive the segment.

Warehouse Segments

Warehouse segments enable you to create segments on MoEngage based on data from your data warehouse without the hassles of copying or moving it to MoEngage. 

Let's say that your brand wishes to offer exclusive discounts to loyal shoppers based on an engagement score that is computed with your proprietary logic. This data is stored and accessible only from your data warehouse. With Warehouse segments, you can access this data from the warehouse directly, build an audience on MoEngage, and send a campaign from MoEngage within a few clicks.

With Warehouse segments, you get real-time access to warehouse data without any syncing delays, accelerating audience generation and enabling timely engagement. Moreover, with data securely stored within the warehouse, Warehouse segments ensure data security, simplifying compliance with privacy regulations and industry standards.

 	

Early Access

Warehouse segment for Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, and Redshift is currently in early access.

Creating a Warehouse segment
Step 1: Set up your data source
Big Query
Snowflake
Databricks
Redshift

Follow the below steps to grant read access to certain tables in BigQuery to MoEngage. Additionally, it covers providing access to BigQuery Jobs API, enabling Moengage to submit jobs and download query results.

These instructions assume you have administrative privileges in the Google Cloud Platform, specifically in the project that hosts the BigQuery dataset and jobs.

Create a Service Account for MoEngage
Open the Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to the project housing the BigQuery dataset and jobs.
Go to the IAM & Admin section and select Service Accounts.

Click Create Service Account.
Provide a name for the service account (e.g., moengage-access).

Set the appropriate role for the service account as BigQuery Job User.


Create the service account.

Navigate to the service account and select the KEYS tab.
Click the ADD KEY dropdown and then select Create new key.

Select JSON as the screen type in the pop-up

Click CREATE to generate and download the JSON key file.
Keep the JSON file securely and share it with MoEngag as below.

Share the below details to warehousesegments@moengage.com to get warehouse segments enabled on your workspace:

JSON key file of the service account created for MoEngage as per the steps above
Your MoEngage workspace name, along with your data cluster (DC) 
Your BigQuery location
Share Access to Specific Tables with Moengage
In the BigQuery console, navigate to the dataset containing the tables you want Moengage to access.
Click the SHARING dropdown and then select Permissions.



Add the service account's email address (found in the JSON key file) as a member with the ""BigQuery Data Viewer"" role. 
Click Save to grant access to the dataset.
Grant Access to BigQuery Jobs API

Skip if access is already given in the first step.

In the Google Cloud Console, go to the IAM & Admin section and then select IAM.
Click Grant Access to add a new member.
Enter the service account's email address (found in the JSON key file).
Assign the Role as BigQuery Job User to enable interaction with the BigQuery Jobs API.
Click Save to grant access to the API.

arrow_drop_down
Limit Access to Specific Tables (Optional)

By following the above steps, you have successfully granted Moengage read access to specific tables in BigQuery.

Additionally, you have authorized access to the BigQuery Jobs API, allowing them to submit jobs and download query results. It is essential to review and manage access permissions periodically to maintain data security.

Step 2: Run a warehouse query
Navigate to the Warehouse segment tab under Segment on the MoEngage dashboard.
Here, you can choose the data warehouse connection which was set up in the previous step, from the Source dropdown on the top.
Once a source is chosen, the data warehouse schema - database, tables, and columns, will be populated on the left panel. From here, you can search for any database, table, or column that you want to use in your query.
You can enter your SQL query in the SQL editor on the right. You can perform any operations, such as joining multiple tables, sub-queries, aliases, etc., as required to return your optimal results.
Click on Run Query to run the SQL query in your data warehouse. You should be able to see a new row added in the Query results section below.
The Query results section provides a list of recently run warehouse queries with query metrics such as Run time, Data scanned, and the number of rows of data returned by a specific query from your data warehouse. These metrics are useful for gauging the performance of your data warehouse queries and can be used to optimize your queries while you write them on MoEngage.
Credits used per query are available for Snowflake.
Databricks does not provide credits utilized when a query is executed; hence, regularly monitoring the usage is recommended.
Redshift does not provide data scanned when a query is executed; hence, regularly monitoring the usage is recommended.
The Query results section also provides the status of each warehouse query run from MoEngage. The status can be successful, failed, or processed. 
Once a query has run successfully, you should be able to expand the row from the Query results section and see the sample results of each query. We show up to 100 rows and 10 columns of data for each query. 
Each query result also has a set of actions that can be accessed from the 3-dot menu on each row. 
Insert in SQL editor: You can directly insert a particular SQL query from the Query results section on the editor.
Do note that this action will replace any existing query in the editor.
Create a custom segment: You can directly create a custom segment from any query result. However, we expect the query to return a single column of IDs (the unique user identification that is present as an ID in MoEngage) in order to be saved as a custom segment. Hence, this option will be active only for those queries that return a single column.
Copy query: This action will copy the query to the clipboard.
Run query: You can run the query from Query results directly using the Run query action. A new row will be added to the Query results section at the top for the new execution.

Warning

1. The SQL query must return a single column of IDs in order to be saved as a custom segment. If the query returns multiple columns, the segment will not return any users.

2. The SQL query runs on your data warehouse directly. Please note that when utilizing this feature, you will incur the costs associated with running the queries from your data warehouse.

3. The SQL query will timeout in 15 min. Reach out to your CSM to configure this limit.

4. The SQL query should be compatible with your DWH. If you are using Warehouse segments on BigQuery, the SQL query must be supported by GoogleSQL. Similarly, Snowflake supports Standard SQL for querying, Databricks supports ANSI standard SQL, and Redshift supports PostgreSQL.

Step 3: Define a warehouse custom segment

Once the SQL query is finalized, you can proceed to create a custom segment. We expect the custom segment query to return a single column of IDs (the unique user identification that is present as an ID in MoEngage). Give a name and a description for the segment.


Step 4: Use the warehouse custom segment

Custom segments created using warehouse segment are of type Warehouse - SQL. They will be listed on the All Segments page.

Actions possible on external custom segments:
View - View the details of the custom segment on the segment info page. Here you can:
View the SQL query that defines the segment
Run the custom segment to update user count - This is when MoEngage connects to your data warehouse, runs the SQL query, and updates the user count.
Edit - You can edit the SQL query that was used to define the custom segment
Create campaign - You can create a campaign directly from the All Segments page. The target audience section of campaign creation will be populated with the selected custom segment. 
External data warehouse segments can be combined with other custom segments as well as user attributes, and behaviors captured in MoEngage. 
Refresh the user count of a Warehouse segment

You can update the user count of an external data warehouse segment in two ways:

On campaign run-time - The data warehouse segment that is part of the Target audience of a campaign will auto-refresh at the campaign run-time.
Run the custom segment from the segment info page - You can also run the segment manually from the segment info page.

Considerations
One warehouse segment can be defined on one data warehouse connection. You can combine multiple custom segments pointing to different sources and create a new custom segment.
Running analysis - Behaviour, Funnel, etc., will not refresh the user count of a warehouse segment. The target audience containing a warehouse segment will either:
Return 0 if the segment has never run.
Return the last run count of users if the segment has run before."

Key concepts
Segment Nesting

Marketers usually segment users based on multiple criteria such as User Property rules (User Attributes), User activity rules (Event Attributes), User Affinity rules, and Custom Segments. Most of the time, a combination of multiple criteria using AND or OR conditions is used to create a complex user segment. 

For better understanding, let’s say A, B, C, and D represent the ‘segment blocks’, which are events & user attributes with all their filters. For example, A can be ‘users who are male’, B can be ‘users who added to cart: wallet in the last 3 days, and so on. You can always create segments like A AND B AND C AND D and A OR B OR C OR D by combining segment blocks using AND/OR operators.





But when a complex segment like ‘(users who are male AND added to the cart: wallet in the last 3 days), OR (users who are female AND added to cart: handbag in the last 3 days)’ is required, it cannot be simply done using just these operators. The reason being either AND, or OR, only one of these will be used to combine these segment blocks. A combination of AND as well as OR cannot be used together. If you change one of the operators in the definition, the rest will automatically change. This is when nesting comes into the picture.

What is Nesting?

When a complex segment like the above example is to be created, we will need to group some of the segment blocks. Logically, if the segment blocks A and B are grouped inside brackets i.e. ‘(A AND B)’, then they are multiple segment blocks ‘nested’ together. So a combination of segment blocks represents the ‘nested blocks’.

With the nested AND/OR capabilities, you can create complex segments with combinations such as:

(A AND B) OR (C AND D). Here, (A AND B) and (C AND D) are 2 nested blocks combined together with the OR operator.
(A OR B) AND (C OR D). Here, (A OR B) and (C OR D) are 2 nested blocks combined together with the AND operator.
(A OR B) AND C AND D. Here, (A OR B) is 1 nested block combined together with 2 other segment blocks C and D using the AND operator.
(A AND B) OR C OR D. Here, (A AND B) is 1 nested block combined together with 2 other segment blocks C and D using the OR operator.



Understanding Nesting Levels

The examples mentioned above have 1 level of nesting. As in, for the complex segment (A AND B) OR (C AND D). In the above example A, B, C, and D have simple definitions using user attributes or event attributes. Those are not segments, those are simple user attributes or event attributes.

But when the A, B, C, or D are in itself a nested block or a segment instead of simple definitions, they will have more than 1 level of nesting.

Actions that increase the nesting level:

By using a custom segment in a query: If a custom segment is used in a query it increases the nesting level of query in below way:
[Nesting level of that query = nth level of custom segment + 1 Level increase]


By using a nested filter in a query: If a nested filter is used in a query it increases the nesting level of the query by 1 level 

Note: 

info	
Using the normal filter button to the query will not affect the nesting level. Any custom segment created using this logic will create a custom segment with nesting level 1. 
Adding multiple nested filters to the query will not add to the nesting level by subsequent levels. At least 1 nested filter is sufficient to increase the nesting level by 1. 

Various cases of nesting levels:
Custom segment	Definition	Nesting level
Type 1	

Created a segment using attributes (no nested filter)




Or




Created a segment using attributes and nested filter

	Level 1
Type 2	Created a segment using only 1 custom segment of Level 1/Type 1	Level 2
Type 3	

Created a segment using 2 linked custom segments (only segments and no nested filters in their definition) - Eg: A -> B -> C, so C will be a Custom Segment of level 3 which has Custom Segment B (Level 2) and Custom Segment A (Level 1) nested/linked inside it.




Or




Created a segment using a custom segment of Level 1/Type 1 with at least 1 nested filter

	Level 3
Type 4	1 segment (of Level 2/Type 2) + 1 attribute outside with nested filter	More than 3 level of nesting
Type 5	2 linked segment inside + 1 attribute outside with nested filter	More than 3 level of nesting
Type 6	Created using 4 linked segment	More than 3 level of nesting 
Let’s understand this using few examples:
Case 1: Level 1 Nesting

F is an event “Has executed App Inbox Icon Clicked atleast 1 time in the last 3 days”

G is an event “Email viewed in Browser”

H is an user attribute “Install status is True” 

I is an event “WhatsApp message clicked”

Here, the nesting level is 1 (one) because:

Any custom segment created only using attributes or nested filter will create a custom segment of Level 1

For example, if a custom segment E is created using these attributes, let’s say with a definition, E = (F AND G) OR (H AND I), the level of nesting for segment E will be 1. Here, the OR is a normal filter and AND is a nested filter. 

OR

By simply creating a custom segment with an user property or user behavior

The nesting level of the custom segment will be 1 in this case.

Segment F = Nesting level 1 

Case 2: Level 2 Nesting

Let’s say, Segment F = Unsubscribe is False

Using this Segment F (of nesting Level 1) in a query to create another custom segment

The above query is of nested level 2, the nesting level in this case is defined as:

Nesting level of that query = nth level of custom segment + 1 Level increase

Thus, Nesting level of the above query = Level 1 (Segment F) + 1 Level = Level 2

Case 3: Level 3 Nesting

Definition of segment: F is a custom segment made up of event attribute “Best time to send Email is between 10 Hrs and 13 Hrs. This will create a custom segment F of nesting level 1.

If this created custom segment F (Seg F - Nesting level 1) is used in the query along with other attributes, as shown below:

Here the level of nesting for the query is 3 because:

Two level because a custom segment F (of nesting level 1) has been added in the query (Level 1 of custom segment F + 1 Level = Nesting Level 2)
Another level - Using nested filter an event attribute is used that increases the nesting level to 2

If this query is used to create a custom segment, the created custom segment will be of nesting level 3.

OR

If you create a custom segment with 2 custom segments inside it, it will create a query of level 3.

Example:

Let’s say, Segment cs_level_1 = Created a custom segment of level 1 using an attribute (Has executed Allowed web Push Subscription atleast 1 time in the last 3 days)

Segment cs_level_2 = Created a level 2 custom segment by adding custom segment cs_level_1 in the query

Level 2 = 1 level of cs_level_1 + 1 level of nesting (as per rule mentioned in the beginning)

Cs_level_3 = Created a level 3 custom segment by adding custom segment cs_level_2 in the query

Level 3 = 2 level of cs_level_2 + 1 level of nesting (as per rule mentioned in the beginning)

Case 4: > Level 3 Nesting

Definition of segment: F is a custom segment made up of user or event attributes J, K, L, M and F is used as a custom segment in Segment E’s definition

F is a nested segment defined as - (J OR K) AND (L OR M). 

J is an event “Has executed Notification Received Android predominantly with (Device Model is Nexus 5 (case insensitive) ) in the last 3 days”

K is an user attribute “Best time to send Email is between 10 and 13”

L is an user attribute “SPAM is false”

M is an user attribute “Mobile user is True”




In the above image, the query has 2 levels of nesting and if the segment F is created using these filters the nesting level will be 2 (E -> F -> J.)

If the above Custom segment F (Level 2 nesting) is used in a query, it will increase the nesting level of the query to 3. As per definitions above.

Where E = (F and G) OR (H AND I)

So the overall segment E is now defined as -  (  {(J OR K) AND (L OR M)}  AND G) OR (H AND I).

 

Here the Level of nesting for the given query is 4 because:

Three levels because a custom segment F (of nesting level 2) has been introduced (Level 2 of custom segment F + 1 Level = Level 3) - as per rule mentioned in the beginning.
Another level - Using nested filter an event attribute is used that increases the nesting level to 4

If this query is used to create a custom segment, the created custom segment will be of nesting level 4. So, the segment E will not be processed as it will become level 4 nesting. 

How to use nested filters

Use the '+ Nested Filter' button to add a nested block. To create a segment with more than one level of nesting, you will need to create a custom segment first (segment E in the above example) and then use the custom segment in the filters.

The nested condition will be preselected, opposite to the outer condition. So, if the outer condition is AND, the nested condition will be OR (ex: (A AND B) OR (C AND D)) and vice-versa (ex: (A OR B) AND (C OR D)). 

Both the nested as well as the outer conditions can be changed. When the outer condition is changed (let's say, from AND to OR), the nested condition automatically gets updated to the opposite condition (in this case, OR to AND) and vice versa. 

Nested AND/OR functionalities are available in segmentation as well as campaign creation pages in the target audience section. They are not supported in Trigger Criteria in Event-triggered campaigns.

A particular user segment can also be excluded from the selected user segment. To use this, click on Exclude user checkbox.

MoEngage supports up to 3 levels of nesting. These combinations offer flexibility in defining specific conditions for segmenting your users.

How to simplify if there are more than 3 levels of nesting?

Segment queries are logical expressions of conditions. Any logical expression can be simplified into 1 level of nesting. Logical rules can be utilized to simplify it.

Logical rules used to simplify the nesting - 

(X AND Y) AND Z  =  X AND Y AND Z
(X OR Y) OR Z  =  X OR Y OR Z
(X AND Y) OR Z  =  (X OR Z) AND (Y OR Z)
(X OR Y) AND Z  =  (X AND Z) OR (Y AND Z)

Here is an example of making a multi-nested segment into 1 level of the nested segment:

Let's say we have a segment block of A & B with a condition - A AND B

 

Segment block A has another definition - A =  C OR D
Then, the expanded definition of the segment - (C OR D) AND B

 

Segment block C has another definition - C = E AND F
Then, the expanded definition of the segment - ((E AND F) OR D) AND B

Simplifying this - (E OR D) AND (F OR D) AND B

 

Segment block E has another definition - E = G AND H

Then, the expanded definition of the segment - ((G AND H) OR D) AND (F OR D) AND B

 

Finally, simplify the above expression in this way - (G OR D) AND (H OR D) AND (F OR D) AND B. This query will have nesting level as 1.

 

With the above example, we can understand that any segment definition can be broken down 

into 1 level of nesting."

Key concepts
Filters in Segmentation

Across various pages on the MoEngage dashboard, events, event attributes, and user attributes filters can be used to get to the desired analysis or segment users. To get the right analysis and the right set of users, it's very important to know the filters.

This article explains how these filters work and if there are any different behaviors or filters on different pages. 

Data Types

On the MoEngage dashboard, there are 6 primary data types.

String
A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are typically used to represent words and text. Character in a string can be a letter of some alphabet, a digit, a punctuation mark, a blank space, etc.

Boolean
The Boolean data type can have values as true and false.
Numeric
A number is a sequence of digits . Numeric data types are typically used to represent amount, quantity , and price.
Geo Location
Geo-location represents the location on the map using latitude and longitude.
Date Time
Date time data types represent the date and time for an event or action.
Array
An array is a group of elements. In MoEngage, we have 2 array data types: String Array and Numeric array.
Terms to know
Term	Description
Key	The key is a record in the database.
Key is set	The field which holds the value of an attribute.
Key not set	The field is not present to hold the value of the attribute.
Stored Value	User Behavior or User Property value that is stored in the MoEngage Application. For example, App/Site Opened, Last Seen, Email Clicked. For more information, refer to Derived Events & Attributes.
Filter Value	The value you choose to filter is based on the selected stored value. For example, you can choose the filter at least and type or select the duration or number of times the App/Site is opened.
String Filters
Operator	Explanation

The stored value matches one of the filter values.


exists	The stored value is present. This includes all values, including Empty String and N/A. Filter users or events where the stored value exists (Key is set). 
contains	The stored value contains one of the filter values.
contains spaces	

The stored value contains spaces.

The spaces can be at the start, in between, or at the end of the value. This includes all values, including Empty String and N/A. Filter users or events where the stored value contains spaces. 


starts with	The stored value starts with one of the filter values.
ends with	The stored value ends with one of the filter values.

does not start with	The stored value does not start with any of the filter values. (Key not set)
The filter is applied to all the attribute values, including those that are not available (The Key is not set).
does not end with	The stored value does not end with any of the filter values. The filter is applied to all the attribute values, including those that are not available (The Key is not set).
is empty	The stored value is """" (The Key is set and the value is null).
is not empty	The stored value is not """" (the stored value is not null), whether the Key is set or not.
Filtering attributes that contains spaces

You can filter attributes that contains spaces in their stored values by doing the following:

Select the attribute to be containing spaces in the Attribute selector dropdown.
Select the operator as Contains Spaces.
Run the query by clicking ""Show Count"". This will give you the users for whom the selected attribute has values that contains spaces.

Note: Contains spaces filter will be highly relevant in the case of unique identifier (UID) attributes like ID, Mobile number, Email ID, MoEngage ID, etc. It is highly relevant for String and Array of string data type. Other data types does not have relevant use cases and might not yield expected results.

Boolean Filters
Operator	Explanation

Filter users or events where the stored value exists (Key is set).
does not exist	The stored value is not present.
The filter is applied to all the attribute values, including those that are not available (The Key is not set).
Event Occurrence Filters

Consider the following assumptions:

Number of times user executes or does not execute the event: n
Event in consideration: Viewed Product
Today's Date - Dec 14th 2023.
Event Retention Period for Segmentation - 30 days ( Nov 14th 2023)
Operator	Explanation
exactly	

The user has the event exactly for the specified number of times.

Example: Has Executed Viewed Product exactly 2 times

This filter would fetch users who have viewed a product exactly twice in the specified date range added in the filter criteria.


at least	

The user has executed the event at least n times (>= n) 

Example: Has Executed Viewed Product at least 1 times

This filter would fetch users who have viewed a product at least once in the specified date range added in the filter criteria.


at most	

The user has executed the event at most n times (<= n).

Example: Has Executed Viewed Product at most 4 times

This filter would fetch users who have viewed a product at most four times (<=4) in the specified date range added in the filter criteria.


for the first time	

The user has executed the event for the first time within the specified date range.

Example: Has Executed Viewed Product for the first time in the last 4 days

This filter would fetch users who have viewed a product for the first time in the last 4 days(till 10th Dec 2023) and have not viewed a product before that (has not executed viewed product before  10th Dec 2023 (period in consideration here - 14th Nov 2023 to 10th Dec 2023)

Note: This operator will run as per the events data retention applicable to your DB


for the last time	

The user has executed the event for the last time within the specified date range.

Example: Has Executed Viewed Product for the last time

This filter would fetch users who have viewed a product for the last time in the specified date range added in the filter criteria.

Note: This operator will run as per the events data retention applicable to your DB

Location-Triggered Filters
Operator	Explanation
Point with Radius	The stored geolocation value is within the circle defined by the point and the radius.
Date Time Filters

To understand filter operators in date-time data types, we need to first understand a few functions -

now = current timestamp up to milliseconds

start_of_day(timestamp) = 00:00:00 of the selected day/date

end_of_day(timestamp) = 23:59:59 of the selected day/date

n days = n * 24 hours

For the table below - n, n1, and n2 are numeric and n2 > n1.

For example
Let's assume now is 7:30:05 PM, 5 Jan 2001 then
now - 3 days = now - (3* 24) hours = 7:30:05 PM, 2 Jan 2001
now + 3 days = now + (3* 24) hours = 7:30:05 PM, 8 Jan 2001
start of the day (now) = 12:00:00 AM, 5 Jan 2001
end of the day (now) = 11:59:59 PM, 5 Jan 2001
Let's assume the date is 1 Jan 2001
start of day (date) = 12:00:00 AM, 1 Jan 2001
start of day (date + 1 day) = 12:00:00 AM, 2 Jan 2001
start of day (date - 1 day) = 12:00:00 AM, 31 Dec 2000
end of day (date) = 11:59:59 PM, 1 Jan 2001
end of day (date + 1 day) = 11:59:59 PM, 2 Jan 2001
end of day (date - 1 day) = 11:59:59 PM, 31 Dec 2000

Attribute to Attribute Comparison

You can now compare a user attribute of a specific data type with another user attribute of the same data type.

Example 1: Consider a marketer looking to identify users who haven't used their app since installing it. Comparing the First Seen and Last Seen user attributes of users can help the marketer identify the users who haven't been active on the app since installation. 

Example 2: Consider a bank entity looking to identify customers with outstanding loans. For every customer, outstanding_loan_amount and loan_amount_paid_till_date are user attributes that represent the total loan amount disbursed and the total loan amount paid by the customer to date. To identify the segment of users with an outstanding loan, the bank can compare these user attributes, as in the following example.

Attribute to Constant Value Comparison

You can now compare a user attribute to a predefined constant value.

Example 1: Consider an E-commerce business looking to identify users who have spent more than $1000 on their platform while upgrading the app. The user attribute total_amount_for_upgrade represents the total amount each user has spent to upgrade the platform to date. To segment users into 'high spenders', the E-commerce business can compare this user attribute with a constant value of 1000 as shown below:

Limitations

The following features currently do not support the new segmentation filters (first/last seen, contains spaces, is empty/not empty, and user attribute comparison):

Conversion Goal
Business Event
Smart Trigger & Dynamic Condition
Flows

Though the new filters are not available in the above features, custom segments employing the new filters can still be created from the Create segment page and used in the features described above. In the upcoming phases, we will plan to support new filters for all the features in the dashboard."

Aggregation Operations

Let’s say you successfully ran a campaign offering a 10% discount last month. Now to pamper your high-value, highly loyal customers, you wish to run a campaign offering a larger discount, but only to the customers who responded to your last campaign. For example, you wish to target only those customers whose spending in the last month increased by 20%, compared to the month before. How do you segment this set of customers?

Growth teams require deep segmentation capabilities to effectively target their users. Aggregation enables businesses to add depth to their segmentation queries by leveraging aggregation operators. Here are a few of the use cases that you can execute using aggregation operators - 

Filter users who have spent more than $1000 in the last 30 days
Filter the user who has purchased the fruit category for more than $200
Filter the user who increased/decreased their spending by 10% for the fashion category.
Filter the user who average spent per order increased by 15% with respect to last week.

Aggregation facilitates growth teams to aggregate an event attribute by using operations such as sum, average, min, max, and median. The aggregation operator on an event attribute combined with the numeric filters helps users write sophisticated queries and extract deeper customer segments.

Aggregation Operators
Aggregation Operator	Description


Sum

	

Sum of the selected attribute value across filtered events in the selected time range for a user.




Average

	

Average of the selected attribute value across filtered events in the selected time range for a user.




Minimum

	

Minimum of the selected attribute value across filtered events in the selected time range for a user.




Maximum

	

Maximum of the selected attribute value across filtered events in the selected time range for a user.




Median

	

Median of the selected attribute value across filtered events in the selected time range for a user.




Change

	

Absolute change in the aggregated attribute value across filtered events between the selected time ranges for a user. 

The primary period is the time period associated with the event selected. The base period is the time period associated with the aggregation operator.

Change = Aggregated value of Primary Period - Aggregated value of Base Period.




Percentage Change

	

Relative change in the aggregated attribute value across filtered events between the selected time ranges for a user. 

Percentage Change = (Aggregated value of Primary Period - Aggregated value of Base Period)*100/ Aggregated value of Base Period.

info	

Information

Aggregation can be applied over a period of 30 days/4 weeks/ 720 hours/1 month as applicable. These limits can be modified, please connect with your CSMs for the same. 
Both Change and Percentage Change can be negative.
Previous Period: The previous period is the same length of time immediately before the primary time range. This is the Base Period of the aggregation. Assume now is 5:15 PM 18 May 2022. If the primary period for the 'last 3 days' is: 15 May 2022 - 18 May 2022, then the base period is 12 May 2022 - 14 May 2022. 
Date Range: Date range available to aggregate the attribute value across filtered events for a user. The chosen date range is the Base Period of the aggregation.
Using Aggregation Operators

Use the + Aggregation button to add the aggregation functionality.

Aggregation with Sum

Segment users who have placed an order at least 2 times in the last 2 weeks with a total purchase amount greater than 1000 dollars. 

Change with respect to Date Range

Segment users who have purchased at least 1 once in the last 3 days and the total amount spent increased by at least 1000 dollars with respect to 24 Sep 2022 - 30 Sep 2022.

Percentage Change with respect to Previous Period

Segment users who have purchased at least 3 times in the 30 days and the average amount spent increased by at least 25% compared to the month before.

Things to Note
Aggregation is available only on numerical attributes as sum, min, max, average, and median are numerical functions. 
Aggregation is available only in the User Behavior Section of Segmentation. 
Event retention and Aggregation:
The previous period in aggregation cannot exceed the event retention period.
Dates available under ‘Date range’ will not exceed the event retention period and the aggregation window.

The median is the approximate 50th percentile of the selected attribute value.

When filtered events are available for a user in the primary period but not the base period, this user is not counted in both Change and Percentage Change. For example, when there is no purchase event for a user in the base period, but it is present in the primary period, this user is not calculated for change and percentage change aggregation.

Change and Percentage change are not available for the date filters: Before, After, In the last N hours/weeks/months, last week, this week, last month, and this month."

Key concepts
Value Suggestions

Value Suggestions is a small but very useful feature for MoEngage dashboard users. Value suggestions are the exact values present in an event attribute or user attribute, which are shown to the users while creating segments or performing any analysis, so users do not have to remember long attribute names and can directly select the value from the suggested ones.

For example, when the user selects the campaign name as an event property, the MoEngage dashboard displays the list of campaigns. If the list is too long, type the value and shorten the suggested list.

Suggestions Criteria
Suggestions are provided for all attributes, except for date values which must be selected from drop-down menus. String and numeric values are eligible for suggestions, while boolean values offer a default selection dropdown for true or false.
For event attributes, data becomes available in the value suggestions one day after they are received. Similarly, for user attributes, data becomes available in the value suggestions two days after they are received.
Value suggestions are stored for a period of 60 days from the time of the last received data.
Only values upto 100 characters are supported in value suggestions. If the values have more than 100 characters they will be dropped and won't be visible in value suggestions.
MoEngage runs value suggestions in the backend at 12:30 AM UTC / 6 am IST everyday and populates data from the previous day.
MoEngage does not show value suggestions for:
Backdated Events - Backdated events are events that happened at time T1 and are sent to the MoEngage platform at time T2 where T2-T1 > 1 day; MoEngage doesn’t consider values from backdated events when creating Value Suggestions.
Naming Conflicts - Custom events or user attributes/properties whose names conflict with MoEngage reserved names will not be considered for generating value suggestions, e.g., appVersion, sdkVersion, os, and user_id.
A maximum of 5,000 suggestions are generated for each attribute.
You can select a maximum of 1000 values to filter the attribute value.

If you select more than 1000 values, you cannot continue the query. If you click Show count, an error message is displayed in the lower right corner.

If you select the condition ""in the following"", you can select multiple values. Use the Value suggestions checkbox to select multiple values. For example, if there are 5000 values, you can select the first 1000 values.

Click Select all to select all values. For example, if there are 5000 values, you can select the first 1000 values. Click Clear all to clear all the selected values.

You can see all the results/suggestions (a maximum of 5000) as soon as you focus on the input field. Enter the first few characters of the value you wish to search and get the list of values. For example, you see many value suggestions when you enter ""Bro"":

If the list is still long, enter more characters until you find your desired value. Continuing with the previous example, when you enter ""Brooke"", you will see an exact match in value suggestions:



When you enter comma-separated values, for example, ""John, Harry"":

They are listed as a single value ""John, Harry"" under a new category Freeform.
They are listed as separate values ""John"" and ""Harry"" under the Newly created category.


info	

Information




For comma-separated values, MoEngage does not show Value Suggestions.

When you paste a large number of comma-separated values, for example, 200 values:
You will see a single value under a new category Freeform.
You will see 200 separate values under the Newly created category.
For masked PII attributes, MoEngage does not show value suggestions even if you enter values that have matching suggestions. For example, if Email ID is a PII attribute and you enter an email ID in the input field, you will not see any value suggestions.
If you close the input box after selecting a few values, you can still search for new values. When you enter a new value, MoEngage searches for it from both Selected Items and Value Suggestions and shows the matching values and newly created values. If the value is an exact match, MoEngage does not show the Newly Created value."

Object Data Type in Segmentation
Overview
 	

Information

This is an add-on feature. Please contact your MoEngage CSM (customer success manager) or the Support team to enable it for your account.

Segmentation provides a structured and organized approach to identifying and querying attributes within an object. This enables effective analysis and decision-making based on the characteristics of the object. For more information, refer to Support for Object Data Type.

On the Create segment page of the MoEngage dashboard, the user segmentation capability of an object data type is displayed under the User property and User behaviour tabs of Select audience section.
Segmentation supports two levels of nesting for the object data type. Above level two nesting, the attributes are shown in the stringified format.

In case of an array of object data type attributes, segmentation will provide the With operator and the And operator for advanced querying.
Create Segmentation Queries with Objects

The attributes of an object can be of any primitive data type. This section provides few examples of writing segmentation queries for user attribute and event attribute scenarios using the following data types:

Query String Attributes
User Attribute

If you want to segment users who have pet dogs, you can use the string data type Animal.pets and the operator is to fetch users who have a dog as their pet.

Event Attribute

If you want to segment users who have Adopted a pet at least once in the last 3 days with attributes such as Membership (String data) as Gold and users having a pet as Cat (Object data).

Description:
Here, Membership is an event attribute with a string data type and Pets.species is another event attribute with a string Object data type. The And operator ensures that the users fetched from the database have fulfilled both conditions.

Query Empty String Values Using Segmentation

If you want to segment users who have an empty string value for a specific attribute. The stored value is """" (The key is set, but the value is null).

Description:
Here, ListOfPets is an object with Name as a user attribute inside it. Thus in the query, the ListOfPets.Name attribute is used with the is empty filter.

Query Numeric Attributes
User Attribute

If you want to segment users who have pets younger than 6 years.

Description:
Here, Pets.age is the user attribute with a numeric data type and less than is the relational operator to filter users with pets aged less than 6.

Event Attribute

If you want to segment users who have purchased a t-shirt that costs $500.

Description:
Here, the User behaviour drop-down displays the Object attribute product.price and the value as $500. The segmentation query has the following event attributes:

Product.Colour as the attribute with string data type
Product.Price as the Object attribute with numeric data type
Product.Currency as the Object attribute with string data type

Example Code

Query Date Time Attributes
Event Attribute:

If you want to segment users who have purchased a red t-shirt whose price is $500 and whose purchase date is before 30 May 2024,

Description:
Here, the segmentation query has the following Object event attributes:

Colour is an event attribute with string data type Red.
Product.Price is an event attribute with string data type.
Product.Purchase-date is an event attribute Object of date data type

	  ""item-cost"" : {

	    ""amount"" : 140,

	    ""currency"" : ""USD""

	  }

	]

The Query Results section in the Create segment page displays the history of all queries executed on the dashboard. For each query, you can find the details such as Query Time, Description, Source, User Count, and Reachable Users.

Functionality of the “With” Operator

You can use both “With” and AND/OR operators to create queries using the Object data type. The AND/OR operator applies the attribute filters across the objects, whereas the With operator applies the attribute filters within an object.

Using the With Operator

Consider the following pet object data type as an example of using the With operator to achieve some uses cases below.

Pets Object
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	[

	{ Breed: “Lab”

	Age: “3”

	Treat: “Bone”

	},

	{ Breed: “Lab”

	Age: “5”

	Treat: “Fish”

	},

	{ Breed: “Bulldog”

	Age: “3”

	Treat: “Pedigree”

	}

	]   
Example 1

If you want to segment users whose dogs were vaccinated 3 times in the last 60 days, whose dogs should be of the breed Lab, with their dogs' age less than 5 years old, and with the dog's favourite treat being Bone, using the With operator:

To achieve this use case, break down the query as listed below:

Find the users whose pets are dogs of breed Lab
Amongst the Lab breed, find those dogs whose age is < 5 years
Amongst the Lab breed of < 5 years, find those dogs whose favourite treat is Bone

Here, the with operator will first search for a parent attribute (in the example above - it is pets.age) and then apply the filter to its child attributes (in this case - pets.treat).

This query will return the user mentioned above because in the array of objects, there is a Lab whose age is < 5 with their favourite treat as Bone.

Example 2

If you want to segment users whose dogs were vaccinated 3 times in the last 60 days, whose dogs are of the breed Lab, with their dog age less than 5 years old, with whose dog’s favourite treat is Fish.

This query will not return any user mentioned above because though there is a Lab with age < 5 years, their favourite treat is not Fish. Simultaneously, there is a Lab breed whose favourite treat is Fish, but its age is not less than 5. Thus, this user will not be returned during segmentation.


Using the And Operator

Consider the following pets object data type as an example of using the And operator to achieve some of the use cases below

Pets Object
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	 

	{ Breed: “Lab”

	Age: “3”

	Treat: “Bone”

	},

	{ Breed: “Lab”

	Age: “5”

	Treat: “Fish”

	},

	{ Breed: “Bulldog”

	Age: “3”

	Treat: “Pedigree”

	}

	]   
Example 1

If you want to segment users whose dogs were vaccinated three times in the last 60 days, whose pets are dogs of breed Lab AND users with pets whose age is > 3 years AND users whose pets have their favourite treat as Fish.

This query will return those users who:

Have pets that got vaccinated 3 times in the last 60 days
Have pets that are dogs of breed Lab
Have any pets whose age > 3 years
Have any pets with their favourite treat as Fish

Thus, the given user will be returned during segmentation because somewhere in the entire array of objects, there is a Lab-breed pet, and some pets are older> than 3 years. Also, some pets have Fish as their favorite treat. Thus, all three conditions are satisfied independently, as required in the case of the AND condition.

Using the OR Operator

Consider the following pets object data type as an example of using the OR operator to achieve some of the use cases below 

Pets Object
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	 

	{ Breed: “Lab”

	Age: “3”

	Treat: “Bone”

	},

	{ Breed: “Lab”

	Age: “5”

	Treat: “Fish”

	},

	{ Breed: “Bulldog”

	Age: “3”

	Treat: “Pedigree”

	}

	]   
Example 1

If you want to segment users whose dogs got vaccinated three times in the last 60 days, whose pets are dogs of breed Lab OR users with pets whose pets have age is > 3 years OR users whose pets have their favorite treat as Duck.

This query will return the user mentioned above because it fulfils the definition of the OR operator (which says that at least one of all the conditions must be fulfilled). In this case, only favorite treat condition = Duck is not fulfilled, but the other two conditions are fulfilled, which will return the user above during segmentation.

info	

Information

Using the With operator, the user will see the attributes with the same nesting level as in the previous field. Other nesting level attributes will not be displayed to maintain consistency. You can use the And operator to achieve this use case.

Key Factors for Object Data Type Ingestion
The object data type is not supported in the File segment upload.
User export through CSV does not support object user attributes.
Aggregation of the array of Objects is not supported. However, aggregation of objects and nested objects is supported.
Object-to-object attribute comparison is not supported in user attribute comparison. Object-to-primitive attribute comparison is still supported.
Redirection from the Create segment page to the campaigns or analytics page is not supported while creating segmentation queries. You must create a custom segment that can be used in all campaigns and analytics pages.
The system automatically chooses the first data type and performs the query if multiple data types are ingested for an attribute.
If both an object and an array of object data type values are passed for an attribute, the MoEngage system will consider the first data type that is passed. It is not possible to query the second data type value. As a workaround, the customer has to use two separate attributes, set them as objects in data management, and pass the object and array of object values separately in those two attributes.
Value suggestion is not supported with Object data type attributes. Values would not be suggested in the drop-down while performing segmentation.

Reachability
User Reachability

As the name suggests, Reachability represents the number of users who can be contacted or connected using the respective communication channels or platforms on MoEngage.

This article explains how the reachability of Push, Email, SMS, and WhatsApp channels are derived. For the Push channel, this also explains the reachability of respective platforms. This article also lists the method of calculation for the different pages present on the MoEngage dashboard.

Reachability

Reachability in different modules across MoEngage:

Segmentation

Queries executed on the segmentation page (Create segment) show reachability for Push, Email, SMS, and WhatsApp channels and reachability across these 4 channels.

The segmentation page also shows the queries executed on the channel's page. You can identify them via the source column.

For reachability calculation on the segmentation page:

Email ID is taken from Settings -> Channels -> Email -> General settings
Mobile Number is taken from Settings -> Channels -> SMS -> General settings
User Profile

The User Profile represents the reachability of a specific user for different channels and platforms.

The green icons on the push reachability card represent the reachability as true for a specific platform. If reachability is true for any of the above platforms, the overall push reachability is true and represented by a green tick mark on the push reachability card. If all platforms are not reachable, it's represented by the red exclamation mark.

Similarly, for Email, SMS, and WhatsApp, if the user is reachable, it is represented by a green icon and a green tick mark on the reachability card. Non-reachable users will have red icons and a red exclamation mark.


For reachability calculation on the User Profile page:

Email ID is taken from Settings -> Channels -> Email -> General settings
Mobile Number is taken from Settings -> Channels -> SMS -> General settings
Campaign

Before sending a campaign, users need to be segmented. A segment can have all users or a desired group of users. All of these segmented users may not be reachable, as the required information or the required permissions are not available for the respective users.
Here is the list of the outbound channels and the respective reachability -

Push

Queries executed on the Push campaign page show push reachability for Android, iOS, and Web reachability across these 3 platforms.


For more information, see Push Reachability.

Email

Queries executed on the Email campaign page show email reachability.
For reachability calculation, the email campaign uses the attribute specified on the campaign page under the User attribute with email address list.

For more information, see Email Reachability.

SMS

Queries executed on the SMS campaign page show SMS reachability.


For reachability calculation, the SMS campaign uses the attribute specified on the campaign page under the User attribute that stores user’s mobile numbers list.

For more information, see SMS Reachability.

WhatsApp

Queries executed on the WhatsApp campaign page show WhatsApp reachability. (Configure WhatsApp)

For reachability calculation, the WhatsApp campaign uses the attribute specified at Settings -> Channels -> WhatsApp -> General settings. The user should have the WhatsApp mobile number and the user’s WhatsApp Opt-In status should be True.

For more information, see WhatsApp Reachability.

Open Analytics

Reachability can be calculated directly using the data present in the MoEngage warehouse. Using Open Analytics, you can derive reachability and get the required data around it. To learn about reachability using open analytics, click here.

Reachability Calculation
Push

Push reachability is derived by the given parameters -

Users should have at least one active device.
In the case of iOS, the app should be installed on the device.
In the case of Android, the app should be installed on the device, and the device should not be opt-out for push notifications.
In the case of the Web, the user should have visited the website once and must Opt-in to the browser permission
Push token for this device should exist.
For reachability on the different iOS & Android, at least one active device for the respective platform should exist, and the device should have the app installed.
MoEngage also updates users' reachability based on feedback from silent Push (run periodically if the setting is ON) or Push notifications.


Based on the above parameters system generates reliability codes for all platforms. The reachability codes are stored in User Attributes 'Reachability Push Android', 'Reachability Push iOS', and 'Reachability Push Web'. The user is considered to be reachable on the respective platform if the attribute value (reachability code) in these attributes is 200.

User Opt-in preferences and Push Reachability

Users are explicitly asked for permission to be sent push notifications during the app's installation on iOS, Android (13 and above), and Web. They can opt in and opt out of receiving push notifications by navigating to the device's app settings and selecting their preference.

The table below showcases the reachability and Opt-in states that are tracked using the following user attributes, as seen in the segmentation section of the MoEngage Dashboard:

Reachability Push Android
Reachability Push iOS
Reachability Push Web
Reachability Push Code (All devices)	Legacy Reachability Description	New Reachability Description (Recommended)
202	

Reachable but Opted-out.


This is the reachability value for any user who has opted out of receiving push notifications on all of their mobile devices.

These users are considered reachable but will not receive notifications on their devices.

	

Not reachable due to Opt-out.

This is the reachability value for any user who has opted out of receiving push notifications on all of their devices.

These users are no longer considered reachable and will not be targeted for campaigns. 

To exclude opted-out users and thereby have more accurate delivery reporting, please reach out to your Customer Success Account Manager.


201	

Reachable and opted in
This is the reachability value for any user who has opted in to receive push notifications on at least one of their devices.

These users are considered reachable.


200	

Reachable and opt-in status unknown
This is the reachability value for users whose opt-in or opt-out preferences are not being tracked by MoEngage yet because these users are on the older SDK version. These users are considered reachable and are attempted for sending push notifications, but some of these users may be opted-out and will not be able to see notifications.

Note: Opt-in or opt-out tracking is supported on MoEngage Core SDK version 12.3.01 and above.


300	

No device found

User will not be reachable if the device is not found for the user. The reason for device not found is when just the user creation has happened but any device is not present for that user. Such type of user can be created in following ways:

If the user is created using user import using a file
If the user is created using S2S API call

403	

Not reachable due to App uninstalled

Any user who is not reachable due to app being uninstalled
404	

Not reachable due to Push ID not found for the app

Any user who is not reachable due to Push ID not found


409	

Not reachable due to invalid push ID

Any user who is not reachable due to invalid push ID

info	

To enable Android push notification opt-in or opt-out tracking, upgrade to MoEngage Core SDK version 12.3.01 and above.

Email

The given parameters derive email reachability - 

User email should exist
User property Hard Bounce should be false
User property Spam should be false
User property Unsubscribe should be false
User email contains '@' 
info	

Email campaign considers all of the above-mentioned parameters for email reachability.
Segmentation and User profile consider the first four parameters to calculate email reachability.

For all users by default  Hard Bounce, Spam, and Unsubscribe are false. If a user unsubscribes from an email or marks any email as spam, then unsubscribe and Unsubscribe and Spam are updated as true, respectively. If the user's email is bounced, then Hard Bounce is updated as true.

SMS

The given parameters derive SMS reachability - 

Mobile Number should exist for the user to be reachable. There is no mobile number format validation used for reachability calculation.

Push Reachability

Push reachability provides the number of reachable users via the Push channel in a segment. Push reachability number is required to decide whether to choose the Push channel for sending a campaign if your goal is to reach users via the best-performing channels.

This article explains how the reachability of the Push channel is derived. For the Push channel, it also explains the reachability of respective platforms (Web, Android, iOS). This article also lists the parameters considered to calculate reachability for users reachable via Push. There is a list of reasons why the users could not be reachable via the Push channel and potential solutions to convert the non-reachable users to reachable users.

User and Platform reachability - Push Campaign

By using the Push channel in a campaign users can be reached on 3 types of devices i.e. Web, Android, and iOS. The push campaign will allow to reach users via push notifications and the reachable user count will be the number of users that are eligible to receive Push notifications.

How is user reachability calculated for Push campaigns?

Push reachability is derived by the given parameters -

Users should have at least one active device.
In the case of iOS, the app should be installed on the device, and the device should be opt-in for push notifications.
In the case of Android, the app should be installed on the device, and the device should not be opt-out for push notifications.
In the case of the Web, the user should have visited the website once and must Opt-in to the browser permission
Push token for this device should exist.
For reachability on the different iOS & Android, at least one active device for the respective platform should exist, and the device should have the app installed.

Based on the above parameters system generates reliability codes for all platforms. The reachability codes are stored in User Attributes 'Reachability Push Android', 'Reachability Push iOS', and 'Reachability Push Web'. The user is considered to be reachable on the respective platform if the attribute value (reachability code) in these attributes is 200 and 201.

MoEngage also updates users' reachability based on feedback from silent Push (run periodically if the setting is ON) or Push notifications.

Reachable users across different channels:

Push reachable users across different platforms:

How to analyze and find reasons for users' non-reachability?

Step 1: Go to Analyse and select ""Users"" to do the user analysis

Step 2: Select the user attribute in the User Properties section (either from Push reachability Android, Push reachability iOS or Push reachability web)

Step 3: Below in the User Analysis Options select Analysis type as ""Distribution"" and click Apply button

Step 4: Analyse the generated graph and look at the reasons for non-reachability for Push channel along with the distribution count

Similarly, you can do this for all the 3 platforms (Android, iOS, Web) together or for other platforms individually.

Potential solutions to solve users' non-reachability problems
Reachability Push Code (All devices)	Reachability Description	What could be a potential solution to solve this?
202	

Not reachable due to Opt-out.

This is the reachability value for any user who has opted out of receiving push notifications on all of their Android devices.

These users are no longer considered reachable and will not be targeted for campaigns. 

To exclude opted-out users and thereby have more accurate delivery reporting, please reach out to your Customer Success Account Manager.

	Targeting inbound campaigns (In-Apps, Card, On-site) to lure the user to opt-in by redirecting to the permissions setting page. As user needs to modify the permission to be reachable.
300	

No device found

User will not be reachable if the device is not found for the user. The reason for the device not being found is when just the user creation has happened but any device is not present for that user. Such type of user can be created in the following ways:

If the user is created using user import using a file
If the user is created using S2S API call (Server call)
	Using outbound email, SMS or WhatsApp campaign target these users to install the app and sign up through any device using the same credentials.
403	

Not reachable due to App uninstalled

Any user who is not reachable due to app being uninstalled

	An outbound email, SMS or WhatsApp campaign can be targeted to these users using suitable content (Offer, FOMO, etc) to make them install the app again.
404	

Not reachable due to Push ID not found for the app

Any user who is not reachable due to Push ID not found

	Check this with your app development team if they have not opted for the MoEngage solution to generate a Push token. The problem could be with the calls made to FCM/APNS for token generation or authentication.
 
409	

Not reachable due to invalid push ID

Any user who is not reachable due to an invalid push ID

Note: Above solutions are some of the potential solutions, which may or may not result in the expected result/success.

Example:

If you want to make all the push unsubscribed users to subscribe for your push notifications, you can do it in this way:

Step 1: Select the section in the pie chart that denotes Push unsubscribed users

Step 2: Create a segment or take action by choosing a Specific channel and Delivery type to target the Push unsubscribed users

Step 3: Configure the content on the campaigns page

Email reachability provides the number of reachable users via Email channel in a segment. Email reachability number is required to decide whether to choose Email channel for sending a campaign if your goal is to reach users via the best-performing channel.

This article explains how the reachability of Email channel is derived. This article also lists the parameters considered to calculate reachability for users reachable via Email. There is a list of reasons why the users could not be reachable via Email channel and potential solutions to convert the non-reachable users to reachable users.

User reachability - Email Campaign

Email campaign will allow to reach users via emails and the reachable users count will be the number of users that are eligible to receive emails on their registered email ID.

How is user reachability calculated for Email campaigns?

The given parameters derive email reachability - 

User email should exist
User property Hard Bounce should be false
User property Spam should be false
User property Unsubscribe should be false
User email contains '@' 
info	

Email campaign considers all of the above-mentioned parameters for email reachability.
Segmentation and User profile consider the first four parameters to calculate email reachability.

For all users by default Hard Bounce, Spam, and Unsubscribe are false. If a user unsubscribes from an email or marks any email as spam, then Unsubscribe and Spam are updated as true, respectively. If the user's email is bounced, then Hard Bounce is updated as true. You can see this in the user info page of the user profile (as shown below).

How to analyze and find reasons for users' non-reachability?

Step 1: Go to Analyse and select ""Users"" to do the user analysis

Step 2: Select the 3 user attributes in the User Properties section (Unsubscribe, SPAM, and Hard Bounce)

Potential solutions to solve users' non-reachability problems
Non-reachability reasons	What could be a potential solution to solve this?


Unsubscribe

Denotes if the user has unsubscribed to the email

These users are considered non-reachable via email channel

	

1. Target these users who are not reachable, via other channels like In-app, SMS, WhatsApp, Push, etc. Use campaign content wisely so that the outcome of the campaign is these users subscribing again. Provide a CTA to the landing page for subscribing again.

2. Diversify your content strategy so that the customers don't feel your only intention is to make them subscribe or unmark as SPAM. Experiment with educational content, FOMO content, nostalgic content, etc.




SPAM/Complaint

Denotes if the user has reported email as SPAM

These users are considered non-reachable via email channel




Hard Bounce

Denotes if the email to the user has hard bounced because of email being wrong or a technical issue with email sender

These users are considered non-reachable via email channel

	You can create a segment of these users and run a campaign using similar channels as above. Here, using the CTA you can redirect them to their user profile on your app or a landing page and ask them to input their email ID correctly.

Note: Above solutions are some of the potential solutions, which may or may not result in the expected result/success.

Example:

If you want to make all the email unsubscribed users subscribe back to receive emails, you can do it in this way:

Step 1: Select the reason on the pie chart, for example: unsubscribe in the below example

Step 2: Create a segment or take action by choosing a Specific channel and Delivery type to target the email unsubscribed users

Step 3: Configure the content in the campaigns page

SMS Reachability

SMS reachability provides the number of reachable users via the SMS channel in a segment. SMS reachability number is required to decide whether to choose SMS channel for sending a campaign if your goal is to reach users via the best-performing channels.

This article explains how the reachability of the SMS channel is derived. This article also lists the parameters considered to calculate reachability for users reachable via SMS. There is a list of reasons why the users could not be reachable via SMS channel and potential solutions to convert the non-reachable users to reachable users.

User reachability - SMS Campaign

SMS campaign will allow to reach users via SMS and the reachable users count will be the number of users that are eligible to receive SMS on their registered phone number. 

How is user reachability calculated for SMS campaigns?

SMS reachability calculation is derived based on two conditions, as explained below:

1. Presence of Mobile number string value in the attribute - Mobile number (Standard)

Mobile Number (String) should exist for the user to be reachable. There is no mobile number format validation used for reachability calculation in Segmentation/Recent queries.

info	

 Mobile Number attribute should be stored as a string data type for proper functioning

But before sending the actual SMS campaign, the system validates the mobile number, the country code, and the format.

Here is how you can look at the Mobile number presence in the user profile:

2. Subscription management (SMS subscription status attribute)

If subscription management is enabled in your account, there will be an additional check for an attribute (SMS subscription status) that will determine the reachability of users on the SMS channel. If the SMS subscription status is True then the user will be marked reachable otherwise the user will be marked non-reachable.

In case subscription management is not enabled for your account, only mobile number presence will be checked for deriving reachability. In case subscription management is enabled for your account, if any of the above two conditions are not satisfied, then the user cannot receive the SMS campaign (not reachable).

info	

There could be a difference in the reachable user count on the ""Create segment"" page and ""SMS campaign"" page because segmentation only checks if user data and user permission to receive the campaign is present, it does not do mobile number validation and considers control group while calculating reachable users. 

How to analyze and find reasons for users' non-reachability?

Step 1: Go to Analyse and select ""Users"" to do the user analysis

Step 2: Select the user attribute present in the User Properties section (Mobile number (Standard) or SMS Subscription Status)

Step 3: Below in the User Analysis Options select Analysis type as ""Distribution"" and click Apply button

Step 4: Analyse the generated graph and look at the reasons for non-reachability for SMS channel along with the user count

Potential solutions to solve users' non-reachability problems
Non-reachability reasons	What could be a potential solution to solve this?


Incorrect user data/mobile number not present

Denotes if the user's mobile number in MoEngage is incorrect/mobile number not present

(Incorrect mobile number validation does not happen while calculating reachable users in segmentation, the check happens just before sending the SMS campaign)

	

You can create a segment of these users and run a campaign using outbound or inbound channels like InApps, Push, Email, etc. Here, using the CTA you can redirect them to their user profile on your app or a landing page and ask them to correctly input their mobile number. You can also use OTP to verify if the provided number is correct.




Subscription status (Only if subscription management is enabled for SMS channel)

Denotes if the user has opted out or un-subscribed for SMS

These users are considered non-reachable via SMS channel

	

(This will be applicable only if ""Subscription Management"" is enabled for your account)

Target these users who are not reachable on SMS, via other channels like In-app, Email, WhatsApp, Push, etc. Use campaign content wisely so that the outcome of the campaign is these users subscribing again. Provide a CTA redirecting the user to the SMS message inbox for users to type the keyword leading to user opting in (Eg: Start, Begin, etc).

Note: Above solutions are some of the potential solutions, which may or may not result in the expected result/success.

Example:

If you want to target the non-reachable users via SMS channel due to mobile number not present, you can do it in this way:

Step 1: Select the reason on the chart, for example: Mobile number - Empty

Step 2: Create a segment or take action by choosing a Specific channel and Delivery type to target the email unsubscribed users

Step 3: Configure the content on the campaigns page

Similarly, you can target users with more conditions e.g. users who have the mobile number present in the user profile but opted out of SMS subscription."

User reachability - WhatsApp Campaign

WhatsApp campaign allows marketers to reach users via WhatsApp and the reachable users count shows the number of users that are eligible to receive WhatsApp on their registered phone number. 

How is user reachability calculated for WhatsApp campaigns?

WhatsApp reachability calculation is derived based on below conditions:

Mobile Number (String) should exist for the user to be reachable. There is no mobile number format validation used for reachability calculation in Segmentation/Recent queries. In addition to Mobile number presence, the WhatsApp subscription status should be True. Both of these conditions will be used to derive user reachability for WhatsApp channel.

info	

 Mobile Number attribute should be stored as a string data type for proper functioning

But before sending the WhatsApp campaign, the system validates the mobile number, the country code, and the format.

Here is how you can look at the Mobile number presence in the user profile:

If WhatsApp subscription status is True, then the user will be considered reachable otherwise the user will be considered non-reachable. You can find the WhatsApp subscription status in the user profile as show below:

(This will be applicable if user has opted out from receiving WhatsApp messages by typing keywords like stop, opt-out, etc)

 

	

Users not reachable because of opt-out WhatsApp subscription cannot opt-in back by typing ""Start, Resume"" similar to SMS channel. Targeting the users via any outbound or inbound channel will not lead to users opt-in to WhatsApp communication. Client needs to use the appropriate WhatsApp subscription API/use file upload to change the WhatsApp subscription status manually for the specific users.

How to Troubleshoot Campaigns with Segmentation Scenarios Containing Date of Birth?
Problem

Users segmented based on their date of birth are not receiving campaigns.

Instructions

Perform the following steps:

1. Validate the segmentation condition used. Ensure the birthday condition is set to ""Birthday yearly where the date is today.""

2. Ensure the timing is set based on the user’s time zone.

Example

If a user's birth date is May 24, 1998, at 3:00, and they did not receive the campaign:

The birth date is stored in the MoEngage data warehouse as ""1998-05-24 00:00:00.000.""

If the database time zone is Egypt (UTC '+03:00), the birth date is adjusted accordingly.

If the segment execution time was recorded at ""2024-05-24T21:45:02.804+00:00"" (UTC) in the Egypt time zone, it converts to ""2024-05-25T00:45:02."" Thus, the date becomes May 25, causing the issue.

Why Is There a Mismatch in the Events and Users Count Between Data Warehouses and the MoEngage Dashboard?
Problem

The count of users who performed an event, like App/Site Opened on a particular day, differs between data warehouses and the MoEngage dashboard.

 Explanation

There may be slight discrepancies due to the following reasons:

The data warehouse export uses event_time (when the event occurred), while MoEngage Analytics and Segmentation use server time (when the event was received at MoEngage servers).
When an event is exported, its associated user profile (user ID and attributes) is also exported. If a profile merge, deletion, or update occurs shortly after the event is picked for export, these changes will not be reflected in the exported event. However, new events will contain the updated profile attributes.
The report on the MoEngage Dashboard is in the App's Timezone, while MoEngage Automated Data Exports happen in the UTC Timezone. This difference should be accounted for when you generate reports on your end.
info	

Information

MoEngage Analytics works on unique users, whereas Exports contain raw data for all exported events. For more information, read Analyze the Volume of Data Exports.

If the difference is more than 10%, you must investigate it for data loss or other errors.

Analysis
Step 1: Define User Property

User properties store information about individuals, including personal details such as name, birthdate, address, and location. They also include unique identifiers like mobile numbers, ID numbers, email addresses, device IDs, and user preferences. You can select multiple user properties to start your analysis. To learn more about the properties, refer to Derived User Attributes.

You can filter each selected user property by assigning attributes. After choosing the user property, click + Filters to add attributes. Adding filters will exclude unwanted data for your analysis. You can apply multiple filters using AND/OR, as demonstrated below:

You can add multiple user properties for your analysis using + Add user property.


Duplicate the added property by clicking the Duplicate step icon in the right corner.

Step 2: Filter Users

By default, you can perform user analysis on all users. However, you can also query for a group of users filtered using User Properties, User Activity, User Affinity or Custom Segments. Filtering users is similar to creating a segment. For more information, refer to Create Segment.

Step 3: Choose an Analysis Option

After defining your users, you can choose how to calculate the data. The following options are available:

Total count: This option provides the total count of available values for the selected user property.
For example, with total count analysis, you can determine how many users have purchased or added a product to their carts within a specific city or group of cities.
Unique count: This option provides the unique count of available values for the selected user property.
For example, you can identify the number of unique products purchased by users over a specific period in a given geography or demographic.
Distribution: This option provides distribution for the selected user property. In a simple way, this is a self-split of data.

You can also configure Custom Distribution bucketing. With custom distribution, you will enter the boundaries in the From and to fields (the lower and upper limits) and an interval size to divide each distribution. This option is available only for numerical properties.

For example, you can use distribution to identify users who would qualify for a specific credit card product or an add-on service based on different spending habits.
Aggregation: This option aggregates the count of the selected user property. The supported aggregation functions are sum, minimum, maximum, average, median, percentile, and distinct count. The aggregation option is available only for numerical attributes.

For example, aggregation can be used to calculate the average screen-on duration of users on your platform.
Email domain analysis: This option provides domain-specific visualization based on the standard email attribute. The email domain is the part after @, for example, gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc.


 For example, consider a bank that wants to analyze its user base using the domains of its users. By performing Email Domain analysis, they can see the number of spam complaints and bounces bucketed on a domain basis.
Step 4: Choose a Split

The Split by option allows you to group and compare the data in a report based on a specific attribute.

For example, you can see the data of users on Android OS in different cities. Here, Android OS is the User property, and the Split by condition is their Last known city.

Step 5: Choose Charts

After your query is generated, choose your preferred visualization type. You can change between Line, Bar, Column, and Pie charts. Every chart holds its own significance.

Line charts are widely used for analyzing data trends, changes, or patterns. They are frequently used to display and compare data over time.

Bar and column charts present aggregated data, such as sales figures for various products, population comparisons of different cities, or analysis of survey responses across different categories.

Column Chart
Bar Chart

Pie charts are commonly used to visualize categorical data that can be divided into distinct parts. They are helpful for displaying the relative proportions or contributions of various categories within a whole. 

Choropleth charts offer a quick and easy way to visually represent the distribution of attributes or variables geographically and help identify patterns or disparities among different regions.



This chart is available only if the Split by condition is Last known country.

You can switch between Numerical and Percentage views for Line, Bar, and Column charts.

Step 6: Tables

In addition to charts, the data is also available for analysis in a tabular format. You can sort the table or change its view using the transpose feature. Additionally, you can download the data in CSV format. For more information, refer here.

How many Monthly Active Users (MAU) or Daily Active Users (DAU) does my app have?
Which cities saw the highest number of hotel bookings on my travel app last month?
How much revenue did I get last month from the latest product I added to my e-commerce app?
What is the distribution of my users based on the revenue made from their orders?
How many distinct songs are played across different segments of users?
What is the average number of orders a user places using my app?
What is the median number of orders placed by each user by my customers last month?
How many minutes did the least active listener play over a day, week, or month on my music or video streaming app?
Getting Started

Getting a Behavior chart follows a workflow similar to other analyses. For a basic overview of performing an analysis, refer here.

Analytics 
Behavior
Analysis
Step 1: Define Events

An event refers to any action a user performs on your app that is tracked. You can add up to 10 events simultaneously.

Each event can be further filtered using + Attributes. Add event filters for specific actions performed by users such as Platform, App Version, and so on.

Use + Attributes again and combine multiple attributes using AND/OR for each event. For example, use the OR filter to combine data across two platforms. If you want to get data for a specific platform and look at the visits to a specific website, use the AND filter.

With Split by, you can compare the data using a specific attribute. To compare, click + Split By and select the attribute from the list with which you wish to compare. You can add a maximum of 10 attributes. For example, to obtain a chart for the number of songs played across different platforms. Select product_viewed as the event and select Platform in the Split By list.

You can add a maximum of 10 events to your behavior chart using + Add Event.

Step 2: Filter Users

By default, you can perform behavior analysis on all users. However, you can also query for a group of users filtered using User Properties, User Activity, User Affinity, or Custom Segments. Filtering users is similar to creating a segment. For more information, refer to Create Segment.

Step 3: Choose an Analysis Option

After defining your events, you can choose how to calculate the data. The following options are available:

Total events: This option provides the total count of selected actions or events performed by the user.
Unique users: This option provides the number of distinct users who have completed the selected event.
Total events per user: This option provides an aggregated count of the total events per individual user. For example, you can get the average number of songs played per user. The aggregation types available are shown below:

Unique sessions: This option provides the total number of unique sessions in which the selected event was performed.
Aggregation: This option aggregates the count of the selected event or action. The supported aggregation functions are sum, minimum, maximum, average, median, percentile, and distinct count. The aggregation option is available only for numerical attributes.

You can aggregate attributes of an event. These attributes are available in the list after selecting your aggregate function type. The available attributes depend on the defined events at the beginning of the analysis.

For more information on advanced Behavior options, refer to Advanced.

Step 4: Select the Comparison and the Duration

In addition to the ability to split an event by attributes, you can also compare all selected events based on common user attributes using the Compare by option on the Behavior Options tab. For example, you can compare the number of successful orders placed by users of different subscription tiers.

You can select a maximum of 10 attributes, including the Split by attributes.
After choosing the Compare by attributes, specify the duration of the analysis.

Step 5: Choose Charts

After your query is generated, choose your preferred visualization type. You can change between Line, Area, Bar, Column, and Pie charts. Every chart has its own significance.

Line charts are widely used for analyzing data trends, changes, or patterns. They are frequently used to display and compare data over time.

Line charts can be viewed in the following ways:

Linear: The chart displays data with a continuous line.

Logarithmic: The chart scales the values on the Y-axis to logarithmic values.

Cumulative: The chart will accumulate all values up to the most recent period shown in the chart.


Area charts combine a line chart and a bar chart to show how data changes over time. These charts show how one or more groups' numeric values change over time. They are often used to show trends in data, such as the growth of revenue.


A bar or column chart is a graph used to compare different measures across various data categories or series.

Column Chart
Bar Chart

Pie charts are commonly used to visualize categorical data that can be divided into distinct parts. They display the relative proportions or contributions of various categories within a whole.


Line, area, column, and bar charts are scaled relative to percentages using an absolute number or a percentage. You can switch between numerical and percentage views for line, area, bar, and column charts.

Granularity

You can also break down the report into Hourly, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly granularities for easy visualization. Based on the granularity you select, unique users will be displayed.

Compare to Past

This will allow you to compare the current chart with past trends during behavior analysis. You can compare any data point over a period of time with the corresponding data point from the previous period. 

You can compare the chart for the following periods:

Previous Day
Previous Week
Previous Month
Previous Quarter
Previous Year
Custom Range
Step 6: Tables

In addition to charts, the data is also available for analysis in a tabular format. You can sort the table or change its view using the transpose feature. Additionally, you can download the data in CSV format. For more information, refer here.

Advanced Behavior Options

For analysis requirements involving complex user behavior data, MoEngage provides advanced analysis options. These features enable elaborate computations and structuring compared to standard count-based reports, yielding detailed results.

Aggregation distribution: This option lets you distribute users into buckets of aggregated event attributes. For example, you can get the distribution of users based on the minutes of songs played.

You can also configure Custom Distribution bucketing. With custom distribution, you will enter the boundaries in the From and to fields (the lower and upper limits) and an interval size to divide each distribution. This option is available only for numerical properties.

Total events per user: This option provides an aggregated count of the total events per individual user. For example, you can get the average number of songs played per user. The aggregation types available are shown below:

Attribute aggregation per user: This is a two-fold aggregation where:


The attribute is aggregated per user.

The attribute is aggregated again with data operations.
The result obtained will provide the arithmetic value of the attribute aggregated per user.
For example, you can know how long the least active listener played. (Minimum of the Sum of minutes)
When to Use Advanced Behavior Options

While standard behavioral reports are excellent for understanding counts and frequencies (For example, ""How many users performed 'Song Played'?""), the Advanced Behavior Options unlock deeper, more nuanced insights when simple counts aren't enough.

Use these advanced features when your analysis requires:

Understanding Distributions: You need to segment or understand users based on the magnitude or range of their actions, not just whether they performed an action.
Calculating Per-User Aggregates: You need to know the average, sum, minimum, or maximum value related to an event or attribute for each individual user.
Complex, Multi-Level Aggregations: Your question involves calculating a metric for each user first, and then performing another calculation (like finding the minimum or average) on those per-user results.

Here’s how each specific option helps solve different analytical challenges:

Aggregation Distribution
What it does: Groups users into defined buckets based on an aggregated numerical event attribute (For example, total minutes played, total purchase value). You can use predefined or custom ranges.
When to use it:
When you need to segment users based on their level of engagement or value (For example, low, medium, and high spenders).
When you want to visualize how users are spread across different levels of activity for a specific metric.
When understanding the distribution is more important than just the overall average or sum.
Example Use Cases

Some of the Use Cases that you can solve using this option:

E-commerce: Identify user segments based on total spending over the last 30 days (For example, buckets of $0-$50, $51-$200, $201+).
Media/Streaming: Understand content consumption patterns by distributing users based on 'Total Watch Time' or 'Total Songs Played' within a period (For example, 0-10 mins, 11-30 mins, 31+ mins).
Gaming: Group players based on 'Total Levels Completed' or 'Total In-App Purchases Value.'
Content Platforms: Segment users by 'Number of Articles Read' or 'Total Time Spent Reading.'
Total Events Per User
What it does: Calculates an aggregate (Sum, Average, Min, Max, etc.) of the number of times an event occurred for each individual user.
When to use it:
When you need to understand the frequency or volume of actions on a per-user basis.
When you want to find the average, minimum, or maximum number of times users perform a key action.
Example Use Cases

Some of the Use Cases that you can solve using this option:

Engagement: Calculate the 'Average Number of App Opens per User' per week.
Feature Usage: Find the 'Maximum Number of Searches performed by any single User' last month.
Activity Level: Determine the 'Average Number of Orders Placed per User.'
Content Interaction: Get the 'Average Number of Videos Watched per User' daily.
Attribute Aggregation Per User
What it does: Performs a two-step aggregation. First, it aggregates a numerical attribute for each user individually (For example, Sum of 'Purchase Amount' per user). Second, it applies another aggregation across those per-user results (For example, Minimum of the per-user sums).
When to use it:
When you need insights derived from comparing individual user aggregates.
When you want to find the extremes (For example, the user who spent the least in total, the user with the highest average session length).
When you need to understand overall patterns based on metrics calculated at the individual user level.
Example Use Cases

Some of the Use Cases that you can solve using this option:

Identify Least Active Users: Find the 'Minimum of the Sum of 'Session Duration'' across all users to see the lowest total engagement time. (Example: ""How long did the least active listener play?"")
Understand Power User Behavior: Calculate the Maximum of the Sum of 'Levels Completed' to find the highest total level progression achieved by any single user.
Analyze Spending Patterns: Determine the Average of the Maximum 'Single Transaction Value' per user to understand the typical highest purchase amount across your user base.
Content Consumption Insights: Find the Average of the Sum of 'Watch Time'' per user to understand the typical total viewing duration for users.

By leveraging these advanced options, you can move beyond simple event counts to uncover sophisticated patterns in user behavior, enabling more precise segmentation, targeted campaigns, and informed product decisions.

Funnels
Overview

MoEngage Funnels provides detailed insights into user conversion across web and mobile applications. Funnels help you understand user interactions at various stages of the customer journey, offering valuable data for optimizing engagement strategies.

A funnel represents a series of events that guide towards a defined event. It is used to calculate conversion rates based on certain user actions. The charts obtained help evaluate conversion rates at each stage of the funnel and assess the overall performance of your product.

Use Cases

Funnels help answer questions like:

How many users searched for a hotel on my travel application and booked one?
How many times did users view a notification, click it, and then get converted?
What percentage of users who visited a particular product on my e-commerce app bought it?
How many times do users play a game before moving to the next level?
How much time do users take to purchase a product?
At what stage of the buying process are most users dropping off?

Funnels
Analysis
Step 1: Define Funnel Steps

A funnel is a sequence of events. Consider an example of a product purchase flow with four steps on your app or website. Using this example, we can define an event for each step of the funnel in the order of App Opened, Product Viewed, Added to Cart, and Order Successful.

Each event can be further filtered using + Attributes. Add event filters for specific user actions, such as Platform, App Version, and so on.

You can combine multiple events for a given step in a funnel. For example, in addition to the above flow of product purchase, consider a flow where the second step of the funnel is Product Searched. You can use OR to add this event. Users who perform either of the events on the second step will be qualified for funnel calculation.

To remove an event sequence from the analysis, turn the Exclude events from funnel toggle on. Excluding events enables users to move to the next step in the funnel only if they do not perform the specified events between the specified steps. If the users perform the excluded event in between the selected steps, the funnel for the user will end there. For example, if you want to exclude the event Coupon Applied, you will add this as an excluded event between the applicable steps. The flow will look something like App/Site Opened > Product Viewed > Add to Cart > Exclude Coupon Used > Order Successful.

Step 2: Filter Users

By default, you can perform this analysis on all users. However, you can also query for a group of users filtered using User Properties, User Activity, User Affinity, Custom Segments, or any such combination. Filtering users is similar to creating a segment. For more information, refer to Create Segment.

Step 3: Choose Funnel Option

You have the following options to measure the funnel:

Funnel - Unique Users: This option counts the number of unique users who have completed the specified steps. In this funnel type, each user is counted only once. If the user completes the entire funnel multiple times, the completion count is one.
Funnel - All Occurrences: This option counts the total number of funnel step completions. If a user has completed the entire funnel multiple times, all instances of completion are included in the analysis.

For information on advanced Funnel options, refer to Advanced.

Step 4: Configure Funnel

After choosing your funnel type, you have the following options to configure your funnel:

Duration: Here, you can select a duration for your funnel analysis. By default, it is performed for the last 7 days.
Funnel split: The funnel split enables comparison of funnels based on the event attribute values. The analysis can be compared to any of the defined step's event attributes. The funnel analysis is divided into values of the event attribute, and the analysis will be presented in a table and chart. You can compare up to three attributes for split analysis. There are three options to perform a funnel split:
 
All Steps: Here, an event attribute must exist across all specified events of the funnel across all steps (including OR and exclude events). All funnel events are first filtered by a specific attribute value, after which funnel analysis is performed on them.
First N Steps: Here, an event attribute must exist in the first N steps of the funnel (including OR and excluding events). Funnel analysis is performed for each value of the attribute up to the selected Nth steps. MoEngage uses a forward-filling method to complete the funnel analysis for events occurring after the Nth step. With forward filling, a single event can be attributed to multiple funnels.
Nth Step: Here, the event attributes of the selected Nth step are available for analysis. Ensure that the event attribute is present in all OR events of the defined step. MoEngage performs backward filling, forward filling, or both as required (depending on the step selection).
Holding Attribute: When an attribute, such as product ID, is carried through multiple steps of the funnel, holding the attribute becomes crucial. The holding attribute constant considers the user and holding attributes as a pair that completes the funnel. You can select a maximum of three attributes.
Funnel window: The funnel window can be used to analyze whether all the defined steps were completed in a specific amount of time. For instance, if you would like to see how many users opened the app (first step) and then made a purchase (last step) within 5 minutes, you can set this limit as the funnel window.
Order: Turning the Strict toggle on considers user events or activities based on the sequence defined in the funnel steps. A Strict Order funnel displays the number of users who have completed all steps in the specified order without performing any steps out of sequence.
Step 5: Choose Charts

After your chart is generated, depending on the type of data, you can switch the chart view for better visualization. You can choose between a line chart or a bar chart to view progress, compare volumes over a time period, or compare absolute numbers.

Charts show a maximum of 20 different entities. The remaining entities are available in tabular format. By default, Funnels is shown in a bar chart for the selected time period. 

You can also break down the report into Hourly, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly granularities and switch between percentage and absolute values for easy visualization. Funnel users will be displayed based on the selected granularity.

Step 6: Tables

In addition to charts, the data is also available for analysis in a tabular format. You can sort the table or change its view using the transpose feature. Additionally, you can download the data in CSV format. For more information, refer here.

Advanced Funnel Options

Advanced funnel options let you answer deeper questions about your funnels. Instead of just seeing who converted, you can explore how quickly users tend to move between key steps and how often they perform certain actions before moving forward in the funnel.

Time to convert - Unique Users: This option distributes the time users take to complete the specified steps. For a single user, MoEngage considers the best time to convert (least time) between the specified steps. This analysis can be performed between two defined steps:

Auto: This displays the time taken for each percentile of users who completed the selected steps. For instance, it shows how much time is required for 50% of the users to convert. The X-axis represents user percentiles (from 1 to 100), while the Y-axis indicates the corresponding time to convert.
Custom: Using custom distribution, you can customize time buckets. This will provide the number of users converted for the selected step within the time bucket. You can analyze a maximum of 25 buckets. Distribution buckets include the lower boundary point and exclude the upper boundary point.


Time to convert - All Occurrences: This option provides the distribution of time taken by all occurrences of conversion for the defined steps. For a single user, MoEngage considers the best conversion time out of all the conversions between the defined steps if the user has completed the steps multiple times. You can perform this analysis between two defined steps. This funnel type has Distribution bucketing options similar to those of Time to convert - Unique Users.
Frequency - Unique Users: This option provides the distribution of the number of times (frequency) a step has been performed before the succeeding (next) step. For a single user, MoEngage considers the lowest frequency count for the analysis. This analysis can be performed between two consecutive defined steps:

Auto: This provides the frequency of performing a step before the next step for each percentile of users. For example, how many times users have viewed the product before purchasing it for 50% of the users. Here, the X-axis provides the user percentile (1 to 100), and the Y-axis provides the respective frequency count.
Custom: Using custom distribution, you can customize the frequency buckets. This will provide the number of users for the selected frequency bucket. You can analyze a maximum of 25 frequency buckets in a single analysis. Distribution buckets include the lower boundary point and exclude the upper boundary point.
Frequency - All Occurrences: This option provides the distribution of the number of times (frequency) a step has been performed before the succeeding (next) step. For a single user, MoEngage considers all frequencies for the analysis. You can perform this analysis between two consecutive steps. This funnel type has Distribution bucketing options similar to those of Frequency - Unique Users.
When to Use Advanced Funnel Options

Standard funnel analysis illustrates who converted between steps and at what rate. Advanced Funnel Options go further, allowing you to explore the dynamics of how users progress through your funnels, specifically, how quickly they move and how often they perform steps before advancing.

Use these advanced options when your analysis requires understanding:

Conversion Velocity: You need to know how much time typically passes between key funnel steps.
Action Repetition: You want to understand how many times users perform a specific action before moving to the next step in the funnel.
Behavior Across Attempts: You need to differentiate between analyzing a user's first/fastest path versus analyzing all their attempts through the funnel steps.

Here’s how each specific option helps solve different analytical challenges:

Time to Convert - Unique Users
What it does: Measures and distributes the time taken for users to complete a sequence between two defined steps for the first time or their fastest time if they've done it multiple times. It offers Auto (percentile distribution) and Custom (user-defined time buckets) views.
When to use it:
When you need to understand the typical speed of initial conversion between two key milestones.
To measure the effectiveness of time-sensitive campaigns or promotions.
To identify bottlenecks where users take an unusually long time on their first successful attempt.
When focusing on the optimal or initial user journey between two points.
Example Use Cases

Some of the use cases that you can solve using this option:

Campaign Urgency: Analyze the time between Campaign Email Clicked and Purchase Completed to see if limited-time offers drive faster conversions (for example, using Custom buckets like 0-1 hr, 1-6 hrs, 6+ hrs). The Auto view can show the median time (50th percentile).
Onboarding Efficiency: Measure the time taken from Account Created to First Key Action Completed.
Feature Adoption Speed: Track how quickly users move from Feature Discovery Event to First Feature Use Event.
Time to Convert - All Occurrences
What it does: Measures and distributes the time taken for all occurrences of conversion between two defined steps, considering users might complete the sequence multiple times. It also offers Auto and Custom distribution.
When to use it:
When users can repeat the funnel sequence, and you want to analyze the time dynamics across all their successful attempts.
To understand conversion speed for recurring behaviors or processes.
Example Use Cases

Some of the use cases that you can solve using this option:

Repeat Purchase Velocity: Analyze the typical time between Added to Cart and Purchase Completed across all purchase journeys for repeat buyers.
Recurring Task Duration: Measure the time taken from Task Started to Task Completed for processes users might perform repeatedly (for example, submitting expense reports, completing lessons).
Frequency - Unique Users
What it does: Measures and distributes the number of times users perform a specific step before successfully moving to the next consecutive step for the first time (or the instance with the lowest frequency count). It offers Auto (percentile distribution) and Custom (user-defined frequency buckets) views.
When to use it:
To understand how much hesitation, exploration, or repetition occurs before a user commits to the next step in their initial journey.
To identify friction points where users repeat an action many times before proceeding.
When focusing on the efficiency of the initial or most direct path between two consecutive steps.
Example Use Cases

Some of the use cases that you can solve using this option:

Product Consideration: Analyze how many times users perform Product Page Viewed before Add to Cart (lowest frequency) to understand initial browsing behavior.
Search Effectiveness: Measure the number of Search Performed events before a SearchResult Clicked event.
Form Completion: Track how many times Help Tooltip Viewed occurs before Form Field Completed for a complex field.
Frequency - All Occurrences
What it does: Measures and distributes how many times users perform a specific step before successfully moving to the next consecutive step, considering all instances where the user completes this transition. It also offers Auto and Custom distribution.
When to use it:
When users can repeat a sequence of steps, you want to understand the repetition behavior across all their journeys through those steps.
To analyze prerequisite actions or exploration behavior in recurring processes.
Example Use Cases

Some of the use cases that you can solve using this option:

Cross-sell/Upsell Exploration: Across all purchase journeys, how many times do users trigger View Recommended Product before Add to Cart?
Learning Patterns: For users completing multiple modules, how many times do they typically perform View Lesson Video before Complete Quiz across all modules?
Support Interaction: Analyze the frequency of View FAQ Article before Submit Support Ticket across all instances of users submitting tickets.

By leveraging these advanced funnel options, you gain deeper insights into user momentum and behavior within your funnels. This enables better optimization of conversion speed, identification of friction points, and a more nuanced understanding of user journeys.

Retention
Overview

Retention in MoEngage Analytics provides insights into user retention, a critical aspect for assessing users' loyalty and measuring your product's recurring user base.

Retention charts provide graphical representations for various cohorts, enabling intuitive understanding. Additionally, tabular reports are available for download to allow for detailed analysis. These comprehensive reports will help you assess retention trends across different cohorts over time.

A cohort is a group of users who share similar behaviors. In the context of web and app analytics, a cohort refers to users who have completed the same events within a specific time frame. For example, a cohort might consist of new users on a music streaming app who actively listen to music for 15 consecutive days.

Use Cases

Retention helps you answer questions such as:

How many users are using my platform after signing up?
What percentage of users visited a particular product on the e-commerce app, returned to the app, and bought the product?
How many users who abandoned a cart were targeted with a reminder campaign and then returned to complete a purchase within the next three days?

What is the quality of users of paid channels compared to others?
In a gaming app, what is the retention rate (returning to play the next day) for users who reached Level 5 compared to those who only reached Level 1?

Retention
Analysis
Step 1: Define Events

An event is any action a user performs on your app that is tracked. Retention is when a user performs an event and then returns to do another event. Select the First Event and Return Event from the list for your analysis.

Each event can be further filtered using + Attributes. Add event filters for specific user actions, such as Platform and App Version.

Use + Attributes again and combine multiple attributes using AND/OR for each event. For example, use the OR filter to combine data across two platforms. If you want to get data for a specific platform and look at the visits to a specific website, use the AND filter.

You can add multiple first events and return events using the OR function if you want to perform the retention analysis for multiple events.

Step 2: Filter Users

By default, you can perform behavior analysis on all users. However, you can also query for a group of users filtered using User property, User activity, User affinity, or Custom segments. Filtering users is similar to creating a segment. For more information, refer to Create Segment.

Step 3: Retention Options
Retention Type

After defining your events, you can choose how to calculate the data. The following options are available:

Unbounded: Unbounded retention provides the percentage of users who were retained until the selected day or later. This metric includes users who performed the return event on or after that day. Here, the user is marked retained on all days until the user performs the return event for the last time. For a higher level of granularity, choose hour, week, or month instead of day.
For example, the user installed the app (first event) in Week 0. The user opened the app (return event) on Day 0, Day 1, and Day 3 but did not open the app on Day 2. The user is counted as retained for Day 0, Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3. The user will be counted as retained for Day 2 as the user was active on the platform for the later period on Day 3.
N-Day: N-Day retention provides the percentage of users retained on the selected day. It also includes the users who performed the return event on the selected day. For a higher level of granularity, choose hour, week, or month instead of day.
For example, the user installed the app (first event) on Day 0. The user opened the app (return event) at least once on Day 0, Day 2, and Day 4 but did not open the app anytime on Day 1 and Day 3. The user will be counted as retained only for Day 0, Day 2, and Day 4. The user will not be counted as retained for Day 1 and Day 3 because the user was not active on these days.


info	

Information

In the case of N-Day retention, a strict order for the first event and the return event is not required. A user will be counted as retained if they perform the return event either before or after the first event. Additionally, if a return event occurs before the first event within the selected granularity (day, week, or month), the user will still be counted as retained for the Nth day.

However, for Unbounded retention, a user is counted as retained only if the first event occurs before the return event. Therefore, if a user performs the return event before the first event, they will not be counted as retained under Unbounded retention metrics.

For information on the advanced retention type, refer to Advanced.

Split By

With Split by, you can compare the data using a specific attribute. Add the desired attributes from the list with which you wish to compare. You can add a maximum of ten attributes.

Duration

By default, retention analysis is performed for seven days. You can select your desired duration in the list.

Step 4: Chart

The visualization type for retention analysis is a line chart. The chart is created as a weighted average of the percentage of retained users for the selected day or selected granularity. This calculation applies to all retention types.

Granularity

You can break down the chart into Daily, Weekly, or Monthly granularities for easy visualization. The retention users are displayed based on the selected granularity.

A few limitations of the retention granularity are:

Hourly retention is available for a day (24 hours).
Daily retention is available for 90-day durations.
Weekly retention is available for 180-day durations.
Compare to Past

The Compare Mode enables you to compare your analyses with data from a specific time period. Rather than performing separate analyses for each insight, this mode allows you to utilize a single analysis to gain insights from multiple perspectives. Click Compare to Past at the top of your chart and select the duration you wish to compare to. You can also select a custom date range starting with or ending with to do a custom comparison equal to the baseline duration. For more information, refer here.

Step 5: Tables

Along with the chart, the data is available in a tabular format.

The Users column shows the number of users who performed the first event on a specific day. The Day 0, Day 1,...Day n columns provide the percentage of users according to Unbounded Retention, N-Day Retention, and First Occurrence.

The day granularity can be replaced with any granularity, such as hours, weeks, or months. The percentage numbers are color-graded for a better holistic view.

Transpose Table

You can transpose the table. This allows you to view and download the table in your preferred format by shifting its vertical and horizontal orientation.

Download

After viewing the information, you can download the chart or table. The charts are downloaded in PNG format, and the table is exported in CSV format.

Retention
Advanced

MoEngage provides advanced analysis to help you gain a deeper understanding of user retention beyond standard cohort charts. This will allow you to explore the nuances of user return behavior and engagement patterns over time.

First Occurrence

First Occurrence shows the percentage of users who perform the return event for the first time (after the first event) on a specific day. It is the percentage of users who haven't performed the return event until the selected day. The First Occurrence is how long the users take to perform the return event. For a higher level of granularity, choose hour, week, or month instead of day.
For example, the user installed the app (first event) on Day 0. The user did not perform the purchase (return event) on Day 1 and Day 2, so the user is counted as inactive on those days. On Day 3, when the user purchases for the very first time, the user is counted as a returned user. We do not consider what happens after Day 3 because this analysis only provides how long the user was away from the app before they came back and performed the returned event.



When to Use First Occurrence

Standard retention analysis typically shows the percentage of users who return and perform an action on specific days, weeks, or months after an initial event. First Occurrence allows for a more specific analysis focused on the timing of initial re-engagement.

Use this advanced feature when your analysis requires understanding:

Time to Initial Re-engagement: You need to know how long it takes for users to perform a specific return action for the very first time after their initial interaction.
Activation Timelines: You want to measure the latency between an initial event (like an install or sign-up) and the first instance of a key follow-up action (like a purchase or core feature usage).

Here’s how the First Occurrence option helps solve specific analytical challenges:

What it does: Measures and shows the percentage of users who perform a specific return event for the very first time on a particular day, week, month, or even hour after performing the first event. It specifically tracks how long users take to perform that return event once, ignoring any subsequent performances of the return event.
When to use it:
When the critical insight is understanding the time lag until the initial activation or key action, not just general repeat behavior.
To measure how quickly users reach a specific milestone for the first time after starting their journey.
To analyze the effectiveness of onboarding or initial engagement campaigns in driving a specific first action.
Example Use Cases

Some of the use cases that you can solve using this option:

Time-to-First Purchase: After an App Install (first event), track daily/weekly/monthly cohorts to see when users make their Purchase (return event) for the first time. This helps you understand how long it takes to convert new users into buyers.
Core feature adoption lag: Following Account Signup (first event), determine how many days/weeks it takes for users to perform Used Core Feature X (return event) initially. This indicates how quickly users discover and engage with key functionality.
Onboarding completion time: After Started Onboarding Flow (first event), analyze how long it takes users to trigger Completed Onboarding Step 5 (return event) for the first time.

By leveraging the First Occurrence option, you can gain precise insights into the critical time it takes for users to perform key actions for the first time after an initial event, helping you optimize onboarding flows, activation strategies, and initial engagement campaigns.

Session and Source
Overview
Session

Session Analysis helps you understand how users interact with your web and mobile apps, enabling you to improve your product and design. By analyzing sessions, you can see the quality of user experiences on your app and website.

What Is a Session?

A session represents a user's series of interactions on your website or app within a specific timeframe. These sessions are primarily tracked by recording the events and activities users perform on their devices.

Sessions are specific to individual devices. User activity or events that occur on the server side are not included within a session.

How Is It Calculated?

A session begins with the first event or activity a user performs on a device. The timestamp of this initial action marks the session's start time.

A session ends under the following circumstances:

Logout: The user logs out of the application.
Source change: The user enters the session from a different traffic source while the current session is active. All sessions are associated with source information. This source data, derived from UTM parameters, includes properties such as the traffic source, medium, and campaign. The source can be organic or paid. A source is considered different only if one or more of its properties are not identical to the existing session's source properties.
Inactivity: The user remains inactive for longer than the specified inactivity period (default: 30 minutes).

Each session has a defined start and end time. All events and activities performed between these times are considered part of that session. Session duration is calculated as the difference between the session's start and end times.

Interaction vs. Non-Interaction Events

User events within a session are considered interactive when they:

Start a new session, even if the app or website is in the background.
Extend the current session, even if the app or website is in the background.
Contain source and session information.

Events required for internal use or technical purposes, or not directly generated by user actions, are considered non-interaction events. These events do not affect session calculations and:

Do not start a new session, even when the app/site is in the foreground.
Do not extend the session.
Do not contain source and session information.

For example, the Notification Received event is a non-interaction event. It does not increase session time and is not counted as a session event.

For more information on specifying non-interactive events, refer to the MoEngage developer documentation: Android SDK, iOS SDK, and Web SDK.

UTM parameter is mandatory for session analysis. For more information, refer to Source Analysis.

Source

User source is a key element in measuring the ROI of marketing efforts. By analyzing sources, you can evaluate traffic quality and engagement to identify the most effective sources, mediums, and campaigns.

Source Properties
UTM Parameters

UTM parameters are used to analyze the performance of different traffic sources. By default, the MoEngage SDK automatically captures UTM parameters from the URL for web traffic and from deep links for mobile apps.

MoEngage supports the following UTM parameters:

utm_source: Identifies the source of the traffic, such as a specific website, app, or link. (Examples: YouTube, Instagram, Google)
utm_medium: Identifies the type of channel used. (Examples: push notification, banner ad, email)
utm_campaign: Identifies the name of a specific marketing campaign. (Examples: Newyear, Bigbillionday)
utm_term: Identifies the search terms used for paid advertising traffic. (Example: Mobile+sale)
utm_content: Identifies the specific content used within an ad or campaign. (Examples: banner, video, product image)

In the following URL, utm_source and utm_medium are the parameter names, and MoEngage and email are their respective values:

https://www.testdomain.com/?utm_source=MoEngage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Newyear &utm_term=mobile+sale&utm_content=image

User-Defined Parameters
library_add_check	

Prerequisites

To utilize Source Analysis effectively, UTM parameters or custom user-defined parameters are required. Without these, information about the source, campaign, medium, content, term, and any custom user-defined parameters will be unavailable. Ensure that all marketing links, referral links, and key-value pairs include UTM or custom parameter information. To enable user-defined parameters, contact the MoEngage support team.

Many marketers use custom source parameters that are specific to their business needs. MoEngage also supports these custom parameters. In addition to the standard UTM parameters, you can define up to five custom parameters for your apps and websites. The MoEngage SDKs will recognize these new parameters in the URL as source properties and automatically include them with all events.

In push notifications, if a deep link is absent or does not contain source information, the SDKs will search for source properties within the key-value pairs.

Attribution

MoEngage employs a last-click attribution model. This means all user activity and events are attributed to the source of the user's most recent click. The session duration defines the attribution window.

For example, if a user arrives via Google Ads, remains active for a session lasting five minutes, and triggers 15 events, the source property value for all 15 events will be Google Ads. If, during the next session, the user arrives organically, the events in that session will not have any source information attributed to them.

Use Cases

As a marketer or a product owner, you can answer the following questions with Session and Source Analysis:

How do total session counts and the number of sessions per user trend over time?
What is the typical depth of a user session in terms of total events and unique event types triggered? 
How many sessions include a specific conversion event (for example, purchase and signup)
What is the average time elapsed between consecutive sessions for a given user? 
How do user activity and key event occurrences differ based on the source, campaign, or medium through which the user arrived? 
What is the performance of traffic sources?
Which MoEngage campaign types are driving the best outcomes, engagement, and retention? 
How much conversion and revenue is driven from traffic sources?
How well is a particular channel performing?

Analyze 
Analytics 
Session and Source
Analysis
Step 1: Select Report Type

The first step involves selecting the type of report you want to generate. You have the following options.

Session count: Session count represents the total number of sessions within a specified timeframe. Each session tracks a user's interaction, starting when they arrive and ending after a period of inactivity. This is measured across the selected source properties, such as Source or Medium. You will learn about the source properties later in this article. For example, you can use this analysis to measure the adoption of a feature.
Average session duration: Average session duration is the total time users spend across the source properties, divided by the number of sessions. It measures user engagement, indicating how long visitors interact with your website or features. Higher average durations often suggest more engaging experiences.
Conversion count: Conversion count gives the total number of desired actions completed by users on a website or app across the selected source properties. For conversion report calculation, MoEngage takes the conversion activity/event present in the MoEngage Dashboard in Settings > Account > General settings. It directly measures the success of your conversion strategy.
Bounce rate: All sessions with a duration of less than 10 seconds are defined as Bounced Sessions. Bounce rate is the percentage of bounced sessions relative to the total number of sessions. This report is available across the selected source properties. A high bounce rate indicates that visitors aren't finding what they expect or aren't engaging with the content.

For more information on advanced Session and Source types, refer to Advanced.

After selecting the report type, you can apply filters by clicking Add Filters. You can filter reports based on one source property. For example, filter reports on a medium like an email.

Step 2: Filter Users

By default, you can perform this analysis on all users. However, you can also query for a group of users filtered using User property, User activity, User affinity, or Custom segments. Filtering users is similar to creating a segment. For more information, refer to Create Segment.

Step 3: Choose the Source Property and Duration

All reports are analyzed based on the source properties. Select a maximum of two properties for the analysis. By default, reports are not split by any property. For more information on source properties, refer here.

After selecting the properties, specify the duration for your analysis and click APPLY.

Step 4: Charts

After your query is generated, choose your preferred visualization type. By default, the report is shown in a Line chart, sorted by the highest count. You can change between Line, Area, Bar, Column, and Pie charts. Every chart has its own significance.

Line charts are widely used for analyzing data trends, changes, or patterns. They are frequently used to display and compare data over time.

Area charts combine a line chart and a bar chart to show how data changes over time. They show how one or more groups' numeric values change over time. They are often used to show trends in data.

A bar or column chart is a graph used to compare different measures across various data categories or series.
Bar Chart
Column Chart
Pie charts are commonly used to visualize categorical data that can be divided into distinct parts. They display the relative proportions or contributions of various categories within a whole.


Line, area, column, and bar charts are scaled relative to percentages using an absolute number or a percentage. You can switch between numerical and percentage views for line, area, bar, and column charts.

Granularity

You can also break down the report into Hourly, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly granularities for easy visualization. Based on the granularity you select, unique users will be displayed.

Compare to Past

This will allow you to compare the current chart with past trends during behavior analysis. You can compare any data point over a period of time with the corresponding data point from the previous period. 

You can compare the chart for the following periods:

Previous Day
Previous Week
Previous Month
Previous Quarter
Previous Year
Custom Range

For more information, refer to Compare Mode in Analytics.

Sorting

When viewing a bar and column chart, you have the following options to sort the charts:

Descending (High to low)
Ascending (Low to high)
Alphabetical (A to Z)
Reverse Alphabetical (Z to A)
Sort by date (Chronological sort)

Step 5: Tables

In addition to charts, the data is also available for analysis in a tabular format. You can sort the table or change its view using the transpose feature. Additionally, you can download the data in CSV format. For more information, refer here.

Advanced Session and Source Options

Beyond just tracking traffic volume from various sources, it's crucial to assess the quality of that traffic. The advanced Session and Source options provide metrics to help you evaluate how users from different sources engage with your platform, how effectively their sessions lead to conversions, and their contribution to revenue.

Average sessions/user: Average sessions per user gives you the mean number of times a single user visits a website or app within a given period across the selected source properties. It is determined by dividing the total session count by the number of unique users. This report type helps you analyze user loyalty and engagement frequency.
Average conversions/session: Average conversions per session provides information on the efficiency of your website or app in achieving desired actions. It is calculated by dividing the total number of conversions by the total number of sessions across the selected source properties. This metric reveals how effectively each user visit contributes to your conversion goals.
Revenue: Revenue report shows the total revenue for the selected source properties. For the Revenue report calculation, MoEngage takes Conversion activity/event and Revenue attribute present in the MoEngage dashboard in Settings > Account > General settings.
When to Use Advanced Session and Source Options

While standard source analysis often focuses on the volume of traffic from different channels (for example, ""How many users came from Facebook?""), the Advanced Session and Source Options allow you to delve deeper into the quality and effectiveness of that traffic.

Use these advanced features when your analysis requires understanding:

Engagement Levels by Source: You need to know how frequently users acquired from different sources return and engage with your platform.
Conversion Efficiency by Source: You want to measure how effectively sessions originating from specific sources lead to desired conversion events.
Revenue Contribution by Source: You need to attribute monetary value directly to your acquisition channels or campaigns to understand their financial impact.

Here’s how each specific option helps evaluate the quality of your traffic sources:

Average Sessions/User
What it does: Calculates the mean number of sessions per unique user within a specific period, segmented by source properties (like source, medium, campaign). It essentially measures repeat visit frequency based on origin.
When to use it:
When you need to compare user loyalty and engagement frequency across different acquisition channels or campaigns.
To identify sources that drive more habitual usage or repeat visits versus those driving primarily one-off visits.
To assess the ""stickiness"" of users acquired from various sources.
Example Use Cases

Some of the use cases that you can solve using this option:

Channel Loyalty: Compare the average sessions per user for traffic acquired via Organic Search versus Paid Social Media over a month to see which channel brings back users more often.
Campaign Engagement: Analyze if users acquired through Email Campaign A have a higher average session count than those from Email Campaign B.
Referral Quality: Evaluate different referral partners by comparing the average sessions per user for traffic originating from each partner.
Average Conversions/Session
What it does: Measures the efficiency of sessions by calculating the total number of specified conversion events divided by the total number of sessions, segmented by source properties. It shows how likely a session from a particular source is to result in a conversion.
When to use it:
When you need to evaluate how effectively different traffic sources convert visitors within their sessions.
To identify high-intent sources that drive efficient conversions versus sources that generate volume but low conversion rates per session.
To optimize marketing spend towards channels delivering sessions that are more likely to convert.
Example Use Cases

Some of the use cases that you can solve using this option:

Campaign Efficiency: Compare the Average Purchases per Session for users coming from Google Ads Campaign X vs. Google Ads Campaign Y.
Content Marketing ROI: Assess if sessions originating from specific blog posts (tracked via UTM parameters) have a higher Average Newsletter Signups per Session.
Channel Performance: Determine which source (for example, Direct, Organic Search, Referral) yields the highest Average Demo Requests per Session.
Revenue
What it does: Reports the total revenue generated, attributed to specific source properties.
When to use it:
When you need to directly measure the monetary value driven by different acquisition channels, campaigns, or sources.
To calculate Return on Investment (ROI) for marketing activities.
To make budget allocation decisions based on the revenue contribution of various sources.
Example Use Cases

Some of the use cases that you can solve using this option:

Marketing ROI: Track the total revenue generated from users whose first touchpoint was Paid Search Campaign Z to evaluate its profitability.
Channel Value: Compare the total revenue attributed to users acquired via Affiliate Marketing versus Email Marketing over a quarter.
Content Contribution: If tracking revenue events, determine the revenue generated by users who initially landed on a specific product marketing page (using source tracking).

By utilizing these options, you can move beyond simple traffic counts to assess the true quality, engagement, efficiency, and financial contribution of your various acquisition channels and campaigns.

User Paths
Overview

User Paths visualize user interaction and navigation within websites and apps by analyzing event trails. This analysis focuses on events performed before or after a specific target event, revealing user behavior patterns. You can identify popular navigation routes and pinpoint potential bottlenecks or friction points in the user experience. These paths consist of event sequences originating from or converging on a desired event within a defined time frame. 

Use Cases

As a marketer or product owner, you can answer the following questions with User Paths:

What are my users doing right after installing or opening the app?
What do users do right before making a purchase or uninstalling the app?
What paths do users follow between clicking a notification and completing a purchase?
How can we analyze and optimize the user onboarding journeys?

User Paths
Analysis
Step 1: Choose Event

An event refers to any action that a user completes on your website or app that is tracked. It’s important to understand how users navigate after completing their first event and to know the path they take to reach a specific event. You have two options to analyze:

Forward user paths: This option displays all user paths that begin with the selected event. To use this feature, select the Path type as Starting with and select the desired Event. For example, you can analyze the user paths that start with the event App/Site Opened.
Reverse user paths: This option shows all user paths that lead up to the selected event. To use this feature, select the Path type as Ending with and select the desired Event. For example, you can analyze the user paths that end with the event Checkout Completed.

The event can be further filtered. To do so, click + Attributes and select event attributes for specific user actions, such as Platform, App Version, and so on.


Click + Attributes again and combine multiple attributes using AND/OR for each event. For example, use the OR filter to combine data across two platforms. If you want to get data for a specific platform and look at the visits to a specific website, use the AND filter.


Step 2: Filter Users

By default, you can obtain the user paths for all users. However, you can also query for a group of users filtered using User property, User activity, User affinity, or Custom segments. Filtering users is similar to creating a segment. For more information, refer to Create Segment.

Step 3: User Paths Options

User Path Window

Select the desired time window to analyze user paths within a specific duration. This option considers the events that occur within the specified time after the starting event or before the ending event.

The window is set to four hours by default. You can choose units of Days, Hours, or Minutes.

For example, to analyze user paths that occur after the App/Site Opened event within a span of 10 hours, you can set the user path window accordingly.

User Path Steps

By default, the user paths chart shows the first five steps taken by the users after the selected event. For some user events, you might want to analyze the path for a specific number of steps. You can have up to 15 steps in user paths.

For example, analyze the first three actions of the user after they receive a push notification by setting the User path steps to three.

Date Range

After defining the user path window and user path steps, select the time frame for which you want to perform the user path analysis. You can choose from:

Today
Yesterday
This Month
Last Month
Custom range

By default, the date range selected is Yesterday. User paths cannot be analyzed for more than 30 days at a time. After selecting the date range, click APPLY. Your chart is now generated.

Step 4: Chart

User paths are illustrated using a Sankey Chart analysis, which displays paths and steps flowing from left to right. Each Node represents a specific event, while a vertical arrangement of nodes signifies a step. The area or cord connecting two nodes indicates the path taken.

You can analyze user paths by examining consecutive nodes and paths. The forward user path begins at an event and then branches out into multiple paths taken by different users following that initial event. In contrast, reverse user paths involve the merging of different paths into one event.

Chart for the Forward User Paths

When you hover over a node, the total number of users for that event is shown, as well as a percentage. You can also see the percentage of users who went to the next step and the percentage of users who did nothing after the current step and dropped off. In this scenario, the end nodes do not display any information about the drop-off or the next step because no information is available.

The Drop off node represents the total number of times users have dropped off from the previous step and the percentage for the first node.

Paths represent the number of times users went from one node to another, along with the origin and destination node names, and the percentage for the origin node.

Chart for Reverse User Paths

When you hover over a node, the total number of users for that event is shown, as well as a percentage. For the reverse user paths, the popup shows the percentage with respect to the last node. You can also see the percentage of users who came from the previous steps and the percentage of users who went directly to the current step/node. In this scenario, the start nodes do not represent any entry, and the information on the previous step is not available.

The Entry node represents the total number of times users have entered the next step and the percentage with respect to the last node.

Paths represent the number of times users went from one node to another, along with the names of the origin node and destination node, and the percentage change relative to the origin node.

Chart Settings

Repeated Events

Repeated events are a series of the same events performed multiple times by users in succession. Click Hide to merge the sequence into one event, and click Show to view the entire sequence.

Exclude Events
To hide certain events from appearing in your User Paths chart, select the desired events from the Excluded events list and click Apply Filters.
Alternatively, you can add the events to be excluded directly to the chart. To do so, perform the following steps:
On the user paths chart, click a desired node. The Perform action dialog box appears.
Under Actions, select Exclude this event.
Click Apply.
Resolution
Resolution provides user path details based on a defined percentage count. You can adjust the resolution to increase or decrease the number of paths and nodes.
With this filter, you can set a lower boundary for node visibility in the user path chart. If the percentage of action/event performed for a particular step is lower than the defined resolution, instead of showing the event as a separate node, MoEngage Analytics will integrate any percentage of events that fall below the resolution filter into a single node and label it as Others.
Split By

You can use the split by option to group and compare data based on a specific attribute. This feature distributes events according to the event property or user property you select. When you choose only one split by attribute, the distribution displays the analysis of available values for that property. When you split an event, the path will be split by the selected attribute at each node where the event is present.

Information

You can select a maximum of five split by attributes for any step.

Alternatively, you can add the split by attributes directly on the nodes. To do so, perform the following steps:

On the user paths chart, click a desired node. The Perform action dialog box appears.
Under Actions, select Split by.
From the Select attributes list, select the desired split by attributes. You can split an event by up to five attributes.
Click Apply.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

For more information about integrating your acquisition metrics with MoEngage, go through the Install Attribution section. 

 

To access the Acquisition page: 

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard.
From the left navigation, select Analyze > Acquisition.


The Acquisition page is displayed.

Filters

The Acquisition page provides the following filters:

Report Type

You can perform the Acquisition analysis for the:

Campaign Name
Publisher Name

This data is coming into Install Attribution Partners of MoEngage such as Branch, Applsflyer, and so on.

Platforms

Acquisition analysis can be filtered for Android, iOS, Windows, or All platforms.

Time Period

You can perform the Acquisition analysis for a specific time period. This time range filters out the users who are First Seen (visited your app for the first time) in the selected time period.

Here the time range filters work in the UTC time zone and not in the App Time Zone. Hence there can be some difference in number between Segmentation and Acquisition.

Metrics

The Acquisition page provides the following metrics: 

Source

Name of the campaign or publisher. If there is no campaign or publisher found, it is called Organic source.

Users

Count of the user acquired from the respective campaign or publisher. 

Uninstalls

Number of users uninstalled from the respective campaign or publisher.

Uninstalls/User

Ratio of unistalls to the acquired users. It shows how many users who came from the specific campaign or publisher have uninstalled the app.

Conversions/User

Ratio of conversion count to the acquired users. It shows how many times an average user who came from a specific campaign or publisher has converted.
The conversion is counted according to the Conversion goal defined at Settings > Account > General settings.

Sessions/User

Ratio of session count to the acquired users. It shows how many sessions an average user performs who comes from a specific campaign or publisher.
This is aggregated according to the user by the definition of a Session—a group of interactions that take place on the app. A session ends after 30 minutes of inactivity and a new session is created if there is an activity after 30 minutes.

Revenue/User

Ratio of revenue to the acquired users. It shows how much revenue an average user generates who comes from a specific campaign or publisher.
This is aggregated according to the Revenue attribute defined at Settings > Account > General settings.

Analyze 
Analytics
Uninstall

Uninstalls analytics visualizes the uninstalls event or users who uninstall the app or website. 

To view the uninstalls analytics, navigate to MoEngage Dashboard > Analyze > Uninstalls



 

Two types of uninstall analytics are enabled:

Uninstall Events
Focuses on the device uninstall events.
User Uninstalls
Focuses on unique users who uninstalled the app.

Ensure that you have configured the Uninstall Settings for your app for the uninstall analytics to be available. For more information, refer to Uninstall Settings.

User Uninstalls and Uninstall Events Difference

The User Uninstalls provide the number of unique users who uninstalled the app. If a user has the app on multiple devices, then the user is counted in User Uninstalls only when the user uninstalls the app from all the devices. As the analytics is at the user level, the filter on user attributes like city, country, number of sessions, and so on is possible.

Uninstall Events provides the number of times the app is uninstalled. If a user uninstalls, re-installs, and uninstalls the app again, both the uninstall actions are displayed in the Uninstall Events tab. As the analytics is based on user actions on a device, the filter on device attributes like OS version, device model, and so on is possible.

User Uninstalls

User Uninstalls analytics provides deeper insights into which users are uninstalling your app with day-level accuracy. 

Two types of user uninstall visualization are available:

User Uninstalls By Time
User Uninstalls By Attribute

You can filter these statistics by:

Platform Type
Date Range
You can select a maximum of 60-day period at a time.
Export the chart data
Export the chart data in various format including CSV, PDF, and image files.
User Uninstalls By Time

User uninstalls by time provide day-level accuracy such as:

You can view daily, weekly, or monthly uninstalls for a time range and platform.
The chart also shows total uninstalls for a set time.

User Uninstalls By Attribute


User uninstalls by attributes provide analytics for various ranges or categories by a user attribute grouped together.

Group uninstalls by any string, numeric, or boolean type user attribute.
The Sum of all uninstalls displayed in the chart is also shown at the top.
For string attributes, by default, the graph displays at most top 10 attribute values by uninstall count.
For example, the  top 10 Last Known Cities are displayed by uninstall count

Compare Mode in Analytics

Compare Mode in MoEngage Analytics enables you to compare your analyses with different elements, such as Time Series and multiple Segments. Rather than performing separate analyses for each insight, this mode allows users to utilize a single analysis to gain insights from multiple perspectives.

By leveraging the Compare Mode, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of your data and draw actionable insights to improve your operations. This approach promotes efficiency, reduces redundancies, and ultimately drives better decision-making.

 

Time Series Comparison

Time Series Comparison allows the juxtaposition of critical metrics from past time duration. In contrast to examining performance indicators from a single period, this approach enables the comparison of data across multiple time intervals, providing a more comprehensive, contextual view of trends and performance. By gaining a deeper understanding of how metrics change over time, you can make informed decisions based on historical data, which, in turn, can lead to improved business outcomes. 

 

When analyzing user engagement metrics for a product feature, comparing data from June to May can reveal patterns, growth trajectories, or emerging concerns. Hence, time-series comparison can offer:

Contextual Analysis: Understanding metrics in the context of time adds depth to data. A spike in user activity might look impressive, but compared to previous months, it might reveal a declining trend.
Swift Pattern Recognition: Comparing time series data can prove useful in identifying recurring patterns, particularly in relation to seasonal fluctuations in sales or user engagement. You can rapidly detect these patterns and gain valuable insights into the performance and behavior of your systems. It can help you to make informed decisions and optimize your operations.
Data-Driven Forecasting: Data-driven forecasting enables proactive strategy adjustments by predicting future performance based on past trends.

 

 

Time Comparison on Behavior, Funnels, Retention, and Session & Source

After performing an analysis, click on the Compare to Past button at the top of your chart and select the duration you wish to compare to. You can also select a custom date range starting with or ending with to do a custom comparison equal to the baseline duration.

 

 

Let's look at an example...

After performing a Behavior Analysis, you want to compare the Total Events of App/Site Opened of the current week to last week.

Select on chart: Compare to Past -> Previous week

Line Chart:



Bar Chart:



 

In the case of Funnels, you will be able to visualize the conversion of the events for both the Current duration and Previous duration

 

 

The Retention Tables come with a default Comparative Overall Retention view. To access the Retention table for both the Current and Previous duration, just click on the Expand table option.

 

 

Note: Time comparison visualization is not present on Area and Pie charts.

 

Actionable analytics in time compare mode

Actionable Analytics can be performed only on the current duration. 

When analyzing behavior and funnel analysis, simply click on the data point of the current duration line or bar to use actionable analytics. For retention analysis, use the retention table of the current duration and apply actionable analytics.

 

Segment Comparison

 

Segment Comparison enables you to perform a comprehensive analysis of multiple user segments concurrently on MoEngage Analytics. This feature lets you juxtapose and scrutinize data for different segments, leading to more comprehensive insights. Rather than analyzing data for one segment in isolation, you can compare and contrast metrics across various segments, leading to a more exhaustive understanding of the data. Segment comparison is also an efficient way to analyze data and helps you to gain a more nuanced interpretation.

 

For instance, consider you're evaluating the behavior of two distinct user groups: those who made a purchase in the last month versus those who didn't. The Segment Comparison feature will allow you to analyze the differences and similarities between these two segments side by side. Furthermore, it offers:

 

Holistic Understanding: You can gain a comprehensive understanding of patterns and anomalies by comparing different segments, a practice that can reveal insights that are often missed when analyzing a single segment. This 360-degree view is invaluable in making informed decisions.
Optimization of Marketing Efforts: As a growth marketer, you can leverage this approach to optimize your marketing efforts by swiftly identifying underperforming segments, and directing resources and campaigns more effectively.
Enhanced User Experience: As a product manager, you can utilize segment comparison to tailor product features for specific user groups, leading to an elevated user experience and enhanced user satisfaction. 

 

 

Segment Comparison on Behavior, Funnels, Retention, and Session & Source

After selecting the events, click on the Add segment to compare in the Filter users section and select the segment based on User Property, User Behavior, User Affinity, or a Custom Segment.

You can select up to 5 different segments for comparison at the moment. 

 

 

Let's look at an example...

After performing a Behavior Analysis with multiple segments, here's an example of output chart and table:

 

In the case of Funnels, you will be able to visualize the conversion of the events for all the segments selected for the analysis

The Retention Tables come with a default Comparative Overall Retention view. To access the Retention table for both the Current and Previous duration, just click on the Expand table option.

 

Note: Segment comparison visualization is not present on Area and Pie charts.

 
Actionable analytics in segment compare mode

Actionable Analytics can be performed on all segments selected during the analysis. 

When analyzing behavior and funnel analysis, simply click on the data point of the current duration line or bar to use actionable analytics. For retention analysis, use the retention table of the current duration and apply actionable analytics.

Important Note: Currently, both Time comparison and segment comparison cannot be performed together.

 

Compare mode on custom dashboards

The Compare Mode functionality integrated within the Custom Dashboards of MoEngage Analytics offers the ability to juxtapose two distinct datasets, enabling you to compare Time Series or Segment data with ease. This feature eliminates the need to create separate reports for each dataset, thus streamlining the process and saving valuable time. By using a single report to gain insights from multiple angles, you can enhance your decision-making capabilities and expedite the process of generating actionable insights.

 

 

The custom dashboard contains charts and tables of Behavior, Funnels, Session and Source, and Retention.

To perform a time series comparison on the custom dashboard, please perform the following steps:
Dashboard Filters -> Select Duration -> Select Previous Duration -> Apply



To perform a segment comparison on the custom dashboard, please perform the following steps:
Dashboard Filters -> Click Filter users -> Select Segments -> Apply

 

Use-cases of Comparative custom dashboards:
Campaign Optimization: When evaluating the impact of two different campaigns, the Time Series comparison offers a side-by-side view of their performance metrics. This direct comparison helps in identifying which campaign strategies are yielding better results.
Audience Understanding: Segment Comparison is a boon when trying to understand audience behaviors. For instance, by comparing metrics of users acquired through organic search against those from paid campaigns, you can make informed decisions on budget allocation and strategy tweaks.
Feature Adoption Analysis: With new feature rollouts, as a product manager, you can use Time Series comparison to analyze user engagement before and after the rollout, thus gauging the feature's success.
User Behavior Insights: By comparing how different user segments interact with the platform, as a product manager, you can tailor experiences based on distinct user needs. For instance, if one user segment uses a specific feature more than another, those insights can be employed to optimize the product experience for that segment.
Iterative Product Development: Segment Comparison in the Custom dashboard offers a dynamic view of how different user groups are reacting to changes. This continual feedback loop ensures that product enhancements align with real user needs.

What is the average count of uninstalls for your product for a given period of time?
Which segment of users requires actions based on how recently they have used the service?
How often do your users engage with your app or website?
Who are the users that require immediate attention to prevent them from churning?

You can track the following metrics:

Uninstall users: This chart shows the count of users who uninstalled your app for the selected time range and platform.
Uninstall events: This chart shows the count of users who uninstalled your app for the selected time range and platform.
Needs attention: This chart shows a count of the users who belong to the Need Attention segment based on their Recency, Frequency, Monetory (RFM) score. These users have spent a good amount of time on your app or website, but it was a while ago.
About to sleep: This chart shows a count of the users who belong to the About to Sleep segment based on their RFM score. These users have not been active recently, and their frequency of visits and monetary spending are below average. 
Hibernating: This chart shows a count of the users who belong to the Hibernating segment based on their RFM score. These users have not visited in a long time and their visits occur infrequently with low spending amounts.
Lost: This chart shows the users who belong to the Lost segment based on their RFM score. Based on their frequency of visits, monetary spending, and last visit, these users belong in the bottom percentile.

Key Metrics are the snapshot of data at a specific time. After that time, data may change or update (for example - User got merged, User location updated, OS updated, LTV Increased, and so on), hence the same query on the same data may result in different numbers after some time.
In a very rare event, data sent by SDK may get some processing delays. In these rare cases, the calculated data may not be correct. MoEngage continuously tracks these anomalies and updates that data into Key Metrics accordingly."

Reachability

Reachability refers to the ability to contact a user through a chosen channel. The Reachability Dashboard in MoEngage Analytics provides insights into the reachability trends of users who have opted in to receive your push notifications and those who have opted out.

You can view users' reachability trends for any 30 days at a time by choosing the desired date range at the top of the dashboard. The starting date for this custom range can go back up to one year.

With this dashboard, you can address questions such as:

How many users are reachable via push notifications?
How many users have opted in for push notifications over time?
How many users are active on your platform but cannot be reached due to opting out of push notifications?

You can view the reachability trends for the following platform users:

Android
iOS
Web

The reachability trends have the following major metrics present:

Push eligible users: These users have at least one active device with a valid push token. Eligible users are calculated based on users having any of these values of reachability user attribute.
201: Reachable and opted in
200: Reachable and opt-in status unknown
202: Not reachable due to opt-out
Push reachable users: These users have at least one active device with a valid push token and have not explicitly opted out. Eligible users are calculated based on users having any of these values of reachability user attribute:
201: Reachable and opted in
200: Reachable and opt-in status unknown
Opted-in users: These users have at least one active device with a valid push token and opted in. These users are considered reachable. Eligible users are calculated based on users having reachability user attributes as:
201: Reachable and opted in
Opted-out users: These users have at least one active device with a valid push token and have opted out on all of them. These users are not considered reachable. Eligible users are calculated based on users having reachability user attributes as:
202: Not reachable due to opt-out"

Custom Dashboards
Overview

These dashboards allow you to add custom analysis charts and reports tailored to meet any product and marketing need. You can add multiple charts and reports to this dashboard and monitor them at the same time.

You can create custom dashboards in two ways:

Private dashboard
Workspace dashboard
Private Dashboard

Private dashboards have built-in access controls, which allow the dashboard owner and members with specific permissions to access the dashboard.

You should create a private dashboard whenever the information you intend to display requires restricted access or confidentiality. You should use Private Dashboards in the following scenarios:

Confidential data: If the dashboard contains sensitive information, such as financial data, strategic plans, personal performance metrics, or client-specific details, a private dashboard ensures only authorized users can access it.
Work in progress: When a dashboard is still under development or refinement, making it private prevents premature viewing or usage by a wider audience until it's finalized and approved.
Targeted collaboration: If a dashboard is meant for a specific team, project group, or set of stakeholders, a private dashboard allows the owner to grant access only to relevant individuals, ensuring the information reaches the intended audience. You can assign different roles, such as Editor for collaborators who need to modify the dashboard or Viewer for those who only need read-only access.
Personal use: For dashboards created for personal tracking, goal monitoring, or individual analysis, keeping them private ensures your personal data remains secure.
Workspace Dashboard

Workspace dashboards are viewable by default to all users who have access to the workspace. The dashboard owner can also give everyone access to edit. In this case, everyone with access to the workspace can edit the dashboard.

The dashboard owner can also limit edit access for specific users. This would allow only those users to edit and add new charts to the dashboards.

You should create a workspace dashboard when the information presented is relevant and intended for sharing with all members of a specific workspace or collaborative group. Some of the scenarios where you can use workspace dashboards are:

Broad team/Group visibility: Use this type of dashboard when the dashboard content (like performance, project updates, or shared resources) should be easily accessible to everyone within that workspace without needing individual invitations for viewing.
Default transparency: This type of dashboard is the go-to option when you want the default permission to be viewing access for all workspace members.
Collaborative environment: This is ideal for dashboards that support group efforts, or metrics where all members benefit from seeing the same information.
Flexible editing control: While workspace members can view by default, the owner retains control over editing permissions. 

User permission definitions for Workspace Dashboards are:

Default access:
Only the owner can make changes to a private dashboard by default.
For a workspace dashboard, everyone added to the workspace will have view access by default.
Owner: The person who has created the dashboard will have full control, including creation, modification, deletion, and user management. The dashboard owner can set the overall access permissions of the dashboard. This includes View for all, Edit for all, and Edit for specific users.
Editors: After the dashboard owner invites another user(s) to collaborate or edit, the user will receive this access. Editors will have the ability to:
Edit the dashboard.
Invite new editors and viewers to the dashboards.
Manage user permissions to change another editor’s permissions as a viewer or a viewer's permission to an editor.
Viewers: Viewers will have read-only access to dashboards to which they are granted access. They can request edit access, and the request will be sent to the dashboard owner via email. They cannot invite new users to view or edit the dashboard.

Custom Analysis
Open Analytics

Growth teams need to perform a lot of data analysis for their daily operations. For this analysis, they need the correct data access at the right time. MoEngage Open Analytics enables growth teams to access the latest data on the MoEngage platform in real time directly from the data storage. MoEngage allows customers to directly query the data warehouse and get desired data.


Capabilities of Open Analytics

MoEngage open analytics can help with  -

Read and Query data using SQL queries through a console or Programmatically via API
Visualize the data on the Open Analytics console through in-build visualization methods available
info	

MoEngage open analytics is not suitable for data exports. For data export, please use MoEngage Streams or S3 exports.

Enable Open Analytics

MoEngage requires 2 sets of information to enable open analytics - 

Email ids of users
The static IP address. (This can be your VPN IP as well. Make sure you provide the static IP, IPs provided by your network provider will not work)
Data Categories

All data received at the MoEngage system can be categorized into 3 kinds –

Device data
User Data
Event data

The data is collected using the SDK and S2S events and processed and stored with events.

Data Schema

MoEngage processes and stores all the device attributes and event attributes in separate event tables for each event.

Table Name - account_name.event_name

attribute 1	attribute 2	attribute 3	-- 	attribute n-1	attribute n
...	...	...	...	...	...
...	...	...	...	...	...

The time window for analysis can be selected using the attribute - day. This partition time works for all tables. Must always use this in your queries to limit the costs. 
For Example

SQL
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	 

	SELECT server_time, COUNT(server_time) as metric

	FROM

	""account_name"".""moe_app_opened_828""

	WHERE 

	day >= '2022-01-01'

	GROUP BY 1

	ORDER BY 1

Event Tables can be joined using common keys/attributes such as - user_id

SQL
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	 

	SELECT user1 

	FROM 

	(SELECT user_id AS user1 FROM ""account_name"".""uptete_spa"") table1 

	INNER JOIN 

	(SELECT user_id AS user2 FROM ""account_name"".""moe_user_merge"") table2 

	ON table1.user1 = table2.user2
Event & Attribute Naming Convention

Event names have structure as ‘EventName_XXX’, for example - moe_app_opened_828
Event Attribute names have a structure as ‘Datatype_AttributeName_XXX’, for example - string_activity_name_880

User Attributes

User attributes are stored in the user table, and the table refreshes one time every day.
Table Name - users_base_table 
Column for MoEngage generated User Id - user_id


attribute 1	attribute 2	attribute ...	attribute n
...	...	...	...
...	...	...	...
Important Attribute Information

(These attributes should be present in all of the events)

day - Time-window for analysis can be selected using this attribute. This partition time works for all tables. This should be considered as the date attribute for Tables.
server_time - UTC at which events reach MoEngage servers.
user_id - This is a MoEngage-generated User Id.
string_uid_125 - This is the User Id generated by your App/Site.
original_event_name - Event Name
user_time - Event time in the local time zone
Open analytics Usage Best Practices
Use day in your queries to optimize query performance. Otherwise, MoEngage will scan the entire table, and scanning costs will be higher.
MoEngage works on a columnar database, so you can use only the columns ( attributes ) you need for analysis. If unnecessary columns are used, cost increases, and query performance decreases.
To optimize queries, refer to best practices.

Analytics - How to
Understanding Count Differences in Behavior and Funnel Analyses

Behavior Analysis and Funnel Analysis are two distinct types of analyses; thus, it is not ideal to compare them. This article explains the differences between these analyses with examples to illustrate why there is a difference in the count when we compare the Total Events in Behavior Analysis to that of All Occurrences in Funnel Analysis.

Behavior Analysis

Behavior Analysis offers insights into specific user actions or events within your application or platform. Total Events analysis in Behavior shows the count of the number of times users perform a selected event. This could be ideal for understanding the usage of certain features within your platform.

Funnel Analysis

Funnel Analysis offers a view of the user's journey through a series of steps or stages, often towards a conversion goal such as a purchase or sign-up. Funnel - All Occurrences analysis counts all funnels performed by all users. This means each occurrence of a funnel step is counted as a separate funnel. 

For example, if Step 1 initiates a funnel, every time a user completes the funnel, the analysis will record each completion, even if the user completes it multiple times. This could be ideal for visualizing and optimizing user pathways toward specific goals, such as purchasing a product or signing up for a newsletter.

In essence, the two methods serve different purposes. To address your requirements adequately, it is essential to comprehend the distinct objectives of these analyses and choose the right one."

Analyze 
Analytics - How to
Different count in Analytics, Segmentation, Campaigns stats & Flows

 

The difference in Campaign Counts

On the MoEngage dashboard, user behavior analysis can be analyzed on different pages - Analyze, Segmentation, and Campaign stats section.

 

Segmentation Counts

The Create Segments page always provides ""unique users"" count.



Analyze Counts

Analyze section pages - Behavior, Funnel, Retention, etc. pages provide two different kinds of counts 

Total event count - This is the count of the action/event done by the user. The total event count is available for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly granularity.
Unique user count - Unique user count is the count of distinctive/individual users performing the events, a user can perform a specific event multiple times. Unique user count is available for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly granularity.

The following Analysis types: Total Event and Unique users counts can be seen in Behavior & Funnels. While Retention always provides a unique user count.

 

 

 

Campaign counts

Here we have taken an example of the Push campaign - 


Impressions represent the number of user devices that have received the notification sent by the marketer. It can also be seen as the total event count of impressions.

Clicks represent the total number of notifications clicked by the users once the notification is delivered. It can also be seen as the total event count of Clicks.

Conversion Events represent the total number of primary conversion goal events that happened within the attribution period from the time the user received the notification.

Conversions

For campaigns having only one recurrence, conversion represents unique users who have accomplished the primary conversion goal event at least once within the attribution period.
For campaigns having multiple recurrences, conversion represents unique users who have accomplished the primary conversion goal event at least once within the attribution period for each recurrence. For example, If a user receives one Campaign Instance on Day X and another on Day Y and converts once on both days, the conversions will be counted as 2.

 

Difference in count
Event count for Impression, Clicks, and Conversion Event should be the same in both Campaign stats and Total Event analysis of the Behavior page.
As these metrics are event counts, they can not be compared with Unique Users.

Conversions in campaign stats provide the unique user count per campaign recurrence,  and Behavior analytics Unique Users provide the unique user count across the hour, day, week, or month.
For example, a user who receives two campaigns and converts two times Monday & Wednesday (within the attribution window) - this user will have campaign conversion as 2 (one for each campaign). In contrast, in Behavior analytics, Unique Users for daily granularity provide 2 users and weekly granularity provides 1 user.
Campaign stats are calculated in UTC and all the analyses provided in the analyze section run on the app time zone. 

Note:  In Funnel analysis, Funnel - Unique User analysis with Holding attribute constant on campaign id attribute across all steps, provide unique converted user for each campaign for the selected granularity. Read more about it here.

 

Funnels and Flow Stats Counts

The disparities in the results of Funnel Unique Users Analysis and Flow Metrics stem from their different methodologies. While the Funnel displays unique user-level conversion counts, the Flow Metrics are calculated at the Unique Trips level.

As an example, if a user enters the Flow on two separate occasions, such as on the 1st and 5th of a month, and completes a conversion once in each trip, the Entry count and Converted Trips will register as 2 in both cases. Conversely, the Funnel analysis of Unique Users will reflect a count of 1 for this user. This discrepancy arises from the Funnel's emphasis on unique user activity, rather than the number of trips undertaken.

Upon comparing the results of Funnel - All Occurrences with the Flows Trip metrics, the count of User Entered Flows remains consistent.

 

Note: To simplify the querying process, we recommend using ""User Entered Flow"" and ""Flow Trip Conversion"" events. This ensures that only users who have entered and engaged with the flow are considered when generating the funnel view. You can use attributes such as ""Flow ID"" and ""Version Name/ID"" to filter for specific flow versions. To differentiate between user types, you can utilize the ""With Control Group"" attribute in these events."

Split Analysis on Attributes

Behavior, Funnel, and Retention analysis can be compared or split on the values of the event attribute and the user attributes. Using the split functionality, the analysis can be compared to the values present in the selected attributes.

For Example -  From which city users are opening the app, comparing different campaigns for the Funnel analysis, or Comparing retention driven by the different user programs.

Analysis can be performed on event attributes or user attributes. In MoEngage analytics, user actions are events and events have event attributes. User properties are user attributes.

Perform Split Analysis
Split Analysis on Behavior

To perform the split analysis, add Split by attribute to the event in the Behavior Page and click Apply button.

 

To perform the split analysis on the user attributes, add Compare by attributes in the setting options of the Behavior Page and click Apply button.

 

You can add up to a total of 10 split-by and compare by options in behavior analysis.

 

Split Analysis on Funnel

Add the Split Funnel attribute to the Funnel Page and click Apply button to get a split analysis. This dropdown has both user and event attributes. You can select up to 5 attributes for the analysis.

Analytics - How to
Different count in Analytics & Segmentation

In MoEngage, user count can be analyzed on two different pages - The analytics page and the Segmentation page.

The Segmentation page provides user count and sample users for a segment and Analytics Pages (Behavior, Funnel, etc) provide, event count, event frequency, revenue, retention & funnel information along with the unique user count.

Behavior & Segmentation Users

To analyze users on Behavior Page, select Plot For as Total Users. This option shows unique users for the selected granularity in the line/area chart or overall unique users in the bar chart.

 

Whereas the Segmentation page shows the overall unique user count.

 

User Merging

A few times these two user counts from the segmentation page and behavior page do not match. This may happen due to user merging. In MoEngage engagement Module, the user who is coming from different devices is merged when the user logs in. User Merging is explained in detail here.

The user merging is available in MoEngage Analytics Module as well. However, it is not enabled by default. Hence there are some leftover anonymous users present in the system.

A normal person may have 2 kinds of events in analytics when the user was anonymous and when the user was logged in and hence identified as two different users.

To overcome this scenario, you can enable user merging. This will help you to merge the anonymous user IDs with registered user IDs and show those uses as One.

 

To enable user merging follow the path:

Settings -> General Settings -> Analytics Settings -> Enable User Merging 

 

 

Funnel and Segmentation Users

There can be a difference in funnel user count and segmentation user count. This is primarily due to how funnel and segmentation work.

The funnel considers the order of the event. For a user funnel of events E1 and E2, the final number is users who have done event E1 and after that E2. Users who have performed E2 before E1 are not considered.

Segmentation does not consider the order of the event. For a user segment of events E1 and E2, the final number is users who have done both events, E1 and E2. It doesn't matter which is the first and which is the second event."

Analyze 
Analytics - How to
Explore the Number of Notifications Received by Users

Growth teams are always on top of the communication that they send to their customers. They need to know if they are sending too few or too many push notifications or emails.

You know the importance of push notifications in marketing. And you know how important it is that users get the notifications you send. So it’s super critical to keep an eye on the number of notifications received by them. The right number of notifications can boost engagement for your app, but too many of them can drive users to uninstall the app. You should analyze notification frequency regularly to prevent this from happening.

Using MoEngage Analytics, you can easily find out how many of your users are receiving notifications and how many notifications. Here’s how: 

Overall Distribution
Go to Analytics > Behaviour.
Select Notification Received Android as an event.
Select Total events per user as the Analysis type and Distribution as Aggregation type in Behavior Options and click on Apply button.






This analysis plots percentile users against the number of times they have received the notification. E.g. bottom 10 percentile users receive 1 notification, 50th percentile users receive 7 notifications and 90th percentile users receive 15 notifications in the last 7 days. 

Custom Distribution

You can modify the distribution bucket based on your desired analysis and see how many users are receiving too many notifications or a specific number of notifications.

You can see the user count for the selected bucket at the hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly level or you can see the user count for the selected bucket for the entire time duration.

 

The ideal number of notifications to be sent to users varies with the industry and also for the app content/services. Growth marketers would want to analyze:

Users receive more notifications and whether they are uninstalling.
Users receive fewer notifications and whether they are engaging enough.
Users receive an average number of notifications and whether they are converting.



With this analysis, you can take the necessary steps to control the number of notifications and optimize for these metrics and the overall user experience.

Similarly, you can analyze the frequency to answer other questions like:

How many times do users open the app?
How many users are repeat buyers?
How many users open the app or buy too infrequently? 
What was the highest number of purchases per user for last month?"

Analytics - How to
Understanding Data Differences between Google Analytics and MoEngage

When comparing data between two analytics platforms, it's essential to understand how the number of users and the metrics are calculated. Most of the analytics platforms have their way of creating, identifying, and merging the user. This article explains why there could be data differences between MoEngage and Google Analytics and lists the common reasons for the differences and possible ways to identify the issues.

For most of our clients, Google Analytics (GA) and MoEngage numbers match, and the difference noticed is marginal(less than 2%). User creation and user identification are the same between MoEngage and GA. Both platforms create a user identifier in their system when a new user visits the App/Website. Both identify users based on the ID provided by the client.

User creation and merging in GA and MoEngage
Action	MoEngage	Google Analytics
Session Unification / User Merging	MoEngage provides universal user merging; all the sessions done by the user are merged into the identified user. For more information, refer to User Merging.	GA provides session unification/merging. All events/hits done in the session are assigned to the identified user. Previous sessions are not assigned to identified users. For more information, refer to Session Unification.
User Creation after Logout	After logout, if a user visits the App/Site again, MoEngage creates a new user for the device/browser as MoEngage does not know if it is the same user visiting again.
(If the user logs in again, they are merged with the identified user.)	After logout, if the user visits the App/Site again, Google Analytics doesn’t create a new user. GA continues with the same user created when the user visited the App/Site for the first time.
Common reasons for discrepancies in analytics numbers

The following are the common reasons for differences in the analytics numbers between Google Analytics and MoEngage.

Bot Traffic - Bot traffic comes to your website from search engine crawlers, price-tracing websites, and others trackers. If this traffic is not blocked from MoEngage tracking, it creates unnecessary extra users.
Tracking in a subdomain - For login or checkout flow, sometimes users are directed to a different domain/subdomain. This may lead to new user creation on that page if the integrations are not handled properly.
Forced logout - If users are forced to log out due to any reason, such as an app update, this would result in having many extra users in MoEngage. The logout creates a new user (if the user visits the app/site). If logout is forced in bulk from the client system, many unnecessary users are created in the system, and any user who does not log in again will have two identities in MoEngage.
User merging - If user identification is not implemented properly at MoEngage or GA’s end, the user count may be inflated.

There could be other reasons than those mentioned above, and they are:

All platforms (Android, iOS, Web) are not integrated with MoEngage/GA.
Duplicate traffic flowing into MoEngage/GA from SDKs Apps vs. CDPs or from Native Apps vs. Web Apps.
The Timezone setting on both of the platforms is set for different times.
Identifying the issue

If there are differences in the data, a basic user analysis and metric comparison between MoEngage and GA can provide insight into why there is a difference. We recommend that you do the following in case of data discrepancies:

Compare the session count, session duration, and average session per user between MoEngage and GA. If the difference is very high, there could be an integration issue.
Compare the count of unique users across the platforms (Android, iOS, Web) to identify if the issue is with one of the platforms.
Compare the count of unique users across the App Versions, OS Versions, and SDK versions to identify if the issue is with a specific App version, OS, or SDK version.
Verify if there is a higher number of logout performed in MoEngage data. This could create unnecessary users.
Verify the count of identified vs. non-identified users in MoEngage to check if the user identification has been implemented properly. Also, verify if user merging is happening at MoEngage. If user merging isn't happening, extra users will remain in the system.
Compare traffic coming from different IP addresses and sources. Check further if you see if many users are created from specific IPs or the specific source
Take a custom event and compare the counts between GA and MoEngage. If the event count is close (less than 2% difference) and the user count difference is huge, there is a user identification and merging issue."

Why does the 0-1 bucket in 'total events per user' behavior analysis show no users?
Problem

The 'Total Events per User' behavior analysis does not show any users in the 0-1 bucket of the custom distribution, leaving the data empty.

Solution

Perform the following steps:

Understand the analysis:
The ""Total Events per User"" analysis focuses on event frequency per user, not individual users.
Exclusion of upper bounds in custom distribution: 

In custom distributions, the upper bounds are typically excluded.
As a result, the 0-1 bucket will always show 0 because it excludes users who have not performed the specified events.
Alternative Solution:
Use segmentation to identify users based on specific event criteria. 
For instance, apply the condition ""Has not executed App/Site Opened"" within a given timeframe to find users who have not performed this event.

This identified cohort of users can be used to create a custom segment or campaign for further analysis and engagement."

Why is there a discrepancy in the behavior table for ingested data?
Problem

The customer observes a discrepancy in event counts between mParticle and MoEngage while passing event data. 

Explanation
Data logging in MoEngage:

The first log is recorded when data from any platform reaches MoEngage.

If no logs are visible for certain days, it usually indicates that: 
Requests did not reach MoEngage.
Requests failed due to validation errors.
Backdated events:
If backdated events are passed (for example, 1,000 events sent on January 10 for January 1), the following occurs:  
These events appear under January 10 in the logs.
However, in the behavior section of the dashboard, they are displayed under January 1. 
If the source platform uses a different logic for displaying event dates, discrepancies will occur.

Information

MoEngage processes data for any specific day using the current_time when the event is received, not the time when the event originally occurred through API (in the case of historical data)."

FAQs - Analyze
What causes unexpected event sequences in user paths?
Problem

An unexpected sequence of events within the User Path charts is observed, where certain events are grouped together or appear out of chronological order. These discrepancies make the user experience confusing, leading to difficulty in accurately analyzing and understanding user steps.

Solution

To address this issue, consider the following factors:

Dropoff in User paths 
The ""Dropoff"" represents an aggregated bucket or step in the User paths graph, typically appearing at the end of the path.
Events within the same step are arranged vertically, but this ordering has no particular significance. 
Server-to-Server (S2S) Events 
S2S events might not include a user_time attribute, leading to the server time being used as a fallback.
Impact of Server Time 
When events are pushed or synced from the app, they may share the same server time if they occur in quick succession.
This can cause multiple events to appear in the same step of the User paths graph, regardless of their actual sequence.
info	

Information

The User paths and the display of events in the graph are influenced by the nature and timing of events, including S2S events.
The vertical ordering of events within the same step has no specific significance.
Events appearing in the same step do not necessarily indicate a break in their sequence or chronology."

FAQs - Analyze
Why do the campaign stats and campaign analytics show different counts?
Problem

Differences in engagement metrics, such as open and click rates, are observed between the Campaign Stats dashboard and the Campaign Analytics page in MoEngage.

Cause

The differences in engagement metrics, such as open and click rates, between Campaign Stats and Campaign Analytics occur due to differences in their analytical logic. While both features are part of the same platform, they present similar data in distinct ways to meet specific analysis requirements.  

Solution

To understand and resolve this difference, review the following points:

Query duration
The campaign dashboard displays data for a specific time range, such as the past seven days.
Events and metrics outside this time range are not included.
Clicked campaign redirect
When you click a campaign, the system redirects you to the Campaign Analytics page.
This page shows the campaign's lifetime metrics, regardless of the time range.
Data calculation 
Consolidated Campaign stats on the dashboard calculate metrics based only on events within the selected time range.
Events that occurred outside of the specified time range are excluded.
Events outside the selected time range 
A campaign could be initiated and include events outside the selected time range.
This can result in discrepancies, such as a lower sent count but a higher opened or clicked count, which can increase the click-through rate (CTR) or conversion rate (CVR).

Why do uninstall event counts in MoEngage differ from Google's data or show zero?
Problem

The uninstall event count or uninstall analytics in MoEngage does not match Google's data, and the uninstall count shows zero.

Solution

To resolve the issue of uninstall analytics showing zero, perform the following steps:

Check if silent push or real-time uninstall tracking is enabled. Uninstalls can only be tracked if either silent push or real-time uninstall tracking is configured. For more information, refer to the relevant documentation:
Silent Push 
Real-time Uninstall Tracking
Understand how uninstall tracking works.
If uninstall data is missing in MoEngage for some days, it may be due to reliance on Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
The Device Uninstall event on the user profile reflects when MoEngage detected the app uninstallation, not the exact time the user uninstalled the app.
Uninstall tracking depends on the callbacks received from the FCM server, and you cannot determine the exact uninstallation time.

By performing these steps, you can ensure accurate uninstall analytics and resolve discrepancies between MoEngage and Google's data."

Why Does Real-Time Uninstall Tracking Differ from the Uninstall Status on the Dashboard?
Problem

After the real-time uninstall tracking is implemented, the uninstalled status on the MoEngage dashboard is expected to match that.

Explanation

The real-time uninstall tracking does not match the uninstalled status on the MoEngage dashboard due to the following reasons:

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) tracks the app-remove event when an app is uninstalled. MoEngage uses this app-remove event through FCM Functions.
The uninstalls tracked by MoEngage's backend may not match the FCM events. The real-time uninstall tracking relies on FCM configuration and the app_remove event.
Currently, MoEngage tracks uninstall by sending silent push notifications to all user devices daily. It can take up to 24 hours to track an uninstall.
The FCM SDK tracks an uninstall immediately, allowing for a quick response.
You cannot change the installed flag. MoEngage manages it through silent push notifications.
info	

Information

If you see more uninstalls in the Play Store console than in MoEngage, it can be an issue with calls made to FCM. In this case, you must contact the FCM support. It is essential to understand that uninstall tracking occurs in the backend, and real-time uninstall tracking numbers cannot be compared.

To implement a real-time uninstall, read Real-time Uninstall Tracking."

Why does the behavior analysis show the In-App shown event after delivery, but the campaign performance chart doesn't?
Problem
The behavior analysis for an In-app Messaging campaign set to deliver on a particular day displays the In-app shown event for days after delivery.
However, the Campaign Performance chart in the campaign shows only impressions on the delivery date.
Explanation

This discrepancy is due to the difference in time considered for Campaign Impressions and the Analyze Module.

Campaign Impressions are based on Event Time.
Data in Analytics and Segmentation is based on Event Received Time (server time).

Uninstall Tracking
How does MoEngage track Uninstalls?

Uninstall Analytics provides the capability to track Uninstalls on a platform level. You can enable uninstall tracking for Android at Settings -> Analytics and Data Settings -> Uninstall tracking.


Android 

To track Uninstalls, we send silent push notifications daily to all devices associated with the users and capture the responses. We mark devices as uninstalled based on the explicit uninstall errors (Not Registered) FCM services.

For other error codes (that don’t explicitly indicate that the device is unregistered) we don’t mark the device as uninstalled, and we continue to send silent pushes to these devices. If these settings are not enabled on the dashboard, we will not proactively check for uninstalls by sending silent pushes. The failed delivery attempts of push campaign messages will still show up as uninstalls.

If you are handling pushes yourself, please ensure you are handling silent pushes as well before enabling this. If you observe blank notifications with no text or logo in your application, it is possible that some custom handling of push notifications and silent push is not handled by the application, in that case it is recommended to turn off uninstall tracking till your app has correctly handled it.

 

info	

Note

Uninstall tracking for iOS was deprecated from August 10th, 2023, following a significant adoption of iOS 15 and 16 versions, which do not support tracking of failed delivery attempts using silent push. However, failed delivery attempts of regular push campaign messages will still show up as uninstalls for iOS devices.

Can we determine when the user has uninstalled the device?

The date and time associated with the 'Device UnInstall' event on the user profile is the time we detected that the application has been uninstalled from the user's device and is not the time that the user had uninstalled the application. Unfortunately, there is no way for us to determine the actual time the App was uninstalled."

Campaign Drafts

A campaign draft is a saved version of the campaign you created. MoEngage facilitates saving campaign drafts automatically and manually, as described in the following sections.

Auto Save Campaign Drafts

This feature helps you save campaign drafts automatically without having to click Save Draft during campaign creation for all outbound and inbound channels. Your progress will get saved automatically every thirty seconds and when you move out of the campaign editor ( if there is any difference between the last saved and existing draft content).

info	

Information

If a user is working on a draft and another user updates the same draft, then the current user will see a message on top indicating that a newer version of the draft is available, also asking the user to reload to get the updated changes.                     
Autosave will only work when the tab is active.
Save Campaign Drafts Manually

You can manually save a campaign draft by clicking the Save Draft button at the top right corner of your campaign creation screen, as seen in the following image.

Where can you see your drafts?

Campaign drafts are available on the All Campaigns page in the Drafts section.

To see your drafts, go to Engage -> Campaigns and click on the DRAFTS tab.

Who can see your drafts?

Users with Manager, Admin, and Marketer roles can view, create, and manage drafts. For more information, refer to Access Roles."

Introduction
Campaign Tags

Campaign tags allow you to add more context to your campaigns. Context can be descriptive names or campaign themes such as onboarding, retention, country, all users, etc. Once added, tags allow you to filter campaigns or identify behaviors of users who received these campaigns.

For example, if you are creating a campaign for discounts on mobiles during a sale event, you can add tags - Discount, Diwali Sale, Mobile, India.

For more information on managing tags, refer to Manage Tags.

Tag Categories 

Additionally, you can also group tags into categories. Categories allow you to organize your labels. For example - During your annual sale, you want to send out multiple campaigns with the context of Electronics Sale, Home Decor Sale, etc. You can create a category Annual Sale and add tags for individual category verticals.

MoEngage provides two categories by default:

Default - All the default tags provided by MoEngage will be under this category. 
Uncategorized -All your tags that are not added to any category will be present here. 
Add tags to a campaign 

Follow these steps to add tags to your campaign -

1. On step 1 of campaign creation, you will see an option ""Campaign Tags""

2. The dropdown will show you a list of all your tags grouped by categories. 

info	

Note

Our workspace contains 500 tags in total. You can use up to 12 tags in a single campaign.

3. Select a tag from the dropdown or create your own tags on the fly. To create a new tag, enter the tag name and press enter. A new tag will be created. 

Note- All the newly created tags will be moved under the category Uncategorized. 

Identify campaigns using tags 

You can filter your campaigns using tags on the All Campaign Page.

When you click on tags, you will see two options:

1. Any of these - It means that you want to see campaigns that have any of the selected tags. For example- If you have selected Tag A and Tag B, ""Any of these "" will show the campaigns that have either of the two tags.

2. All of these - It means that you want to see campaigns that have all the selected tags. For example- If you have selected Tag A and Tag B, ""All of these"" will show the campaigns that have both tags- A and B of two tags.

Analyze/Segment users based on tags

You can filter your users based on the tags. Use filter query for users who received a campaign with specific tags. These are available as a list of tags under the filter campaign tags. 

How to segment users?

Consider the following scenario-

- There are two categories Country and Sale. Category Country has the tags India and US. Category Sale with tags Mobile and Apparels  

- There are three push campaigns C1, C2, and C3. C1 has tags US, Mobiles. C2 has tags India, Apparels.  C3 has tags India, Mobiles.   

Now, you want to segment users who have clicked on any of the Mobile related campaigns. Then, 

1. Navigate to the Segments >> Create segment. 

2. Select an event Notification clicked.

3. Use filter by Campaign Tags in the following Mobiles.  

This will segment all users who have clicked on the notifications from campaigns C1 and C2, irrespective of the country tag. 

Read more about segments here. 

Tags in Campaign Reports 

All the campaign tags will be available in the campaign reports. The tags will be included with each ""tag category"" as a separate column in the report.  

In the same scenario as above, the output report will have two additional columns - Tag category Country and Tag category Sale. Each column will have a list of selected tags for the particular campaign.

Note- You'll need to select Tags while creating your custom automated reports. Read more about Campaign reports here."

Campaigns and Channels 
Getting Started 
Introduction
Control Groups
Overview

A control group is a subset of the users you target with a specific campaign, who do not receive the campaign communication. Its primary purpose is to act as a baseline for comparison. By measuring the performance of this group alongside your ""target"" groups (which do receive the change), you can accurately determine the true impact and effectiveness of your marketing efforts.

info	

Information

A target group is a subset of customers you target in an experiment, who receive the campaign communication being tested. These groups are also called ""test"" or ""variant"" groups.

What Constitutes the Control Group?
The control group consists of users who do not receive a notification, serving as a baseline for comparison.
The Active Target count in the control group includes users who are eligible for notifications but are intentionally excluded from receiving them.
Impressions for the control group are always zero, as no notifications are sent.
Conversions represent the count of users in the control group who completed a conversion event.
The conversion rate for the control group is calculated as Conversions (CVR) divided by Active Targets.
Why Do You Need the Control Group?

As a marketer, you often face the dilemma of what should be communicated to customers and what is futile. You would specifically want to know, ""Is the communication I am sending to my customers adding value to them or my business? Will I be able to fulfill my objectives without sending that communication?"" Here is where marketing research experts suggest using the control group and the target group.

The primary purpose of a control group is to provide a baseline for comparison. By comparing the behavior and conversion rates of the target group (which received the campaign communication) with the control group (which did not), you can more accurately measure the incremental impact or uplift of their campaigns. Uplift measures the difference in performance between the target and control groups and is calculated to determine the communication's impact (positive or negative). This helps determine if the marketing activity itself caused a change in behavior or if the change would have happened organically.

You can check the campaign's impact on uplift, whether customer engagement and conversions would be better or worse if the specific campaign had not been sent to some customers. While no communication is being sent to the control group, MoEngage tracks the conversions for the users in this group.

Types of Control Groups

You can create two types of control groups:

Global Control Group

The global control group is a strategically selected subset of the entire user base that is intentionally excluded from receiving any marketing campaigns across all available channels. An administrator can configure it at the workspace level. For more information, refer to Global Control Group.

Campaign Control Group

A campaign control group is defined at the individual campaign level. It comprises a subset of users who specifically qualify for a particular campaign but are intentionally withheld from receiving its communications.

Campaign control groups are independent of the global control group. You can enable or disable campaign control groups regardless of whether your admin has enabled or disabled the global control group for your workspace.

Use Control Groups in a Campaign

You can create a campaign using the global control group, the campaign control group, or both. During campaign creation, the Global control group and/or the Campaign control group toggles are available in the control group section of step 1, Content.

Add the Global Control Group to a Campaign

If your admin has enabled the global control group for your workspace, the Global control group toggle is turned on by default in the control group section. That means the users in the control group will not receive the communication from this campaign.

If your admin has disabled the global control group for your workspace, the Global control group toggle is turned off by default. As a marketer, you cannot enable it at the campaign level. Contact your admin to enable it for the workspace (account) first.

If your admin has selected the Allow marketers to send campaigns to these users check box while enabling the global control group, you can turn the Global control group toggle off. When you turn this toggle off, MoEngage will send campaigns to the users in the global control group.

Add a Campaign Control Group

At the campaign level, you can add a dedicated control group to strategically restrict communication to a defined subset of users.

To add a campaign control group, perform the following steps:

Turn the Campaign control group toggle on to exclude the users in the control group from the campaign.
In the box below, specify the percentage of users from the target audience to be excluded from the campaign.

info	

Information

MoEngage distributes users between the control and target groups based on this percentage. Prior to the distribution, MoEngage filters out users who are ineligible for notifications due to frequency capping, communication preferences, or reachability issues.
When a user is added to a control group, MoEngage raises an event named User added to control group with the attribute Control Group type, which has the value Campaign.
Channels That Support Campaign Control Group

Uplift

Uplift in campaign analytics refers to the increase in the desired metric (such as conversion rate, revenue, or customer engagement) that can be attributed to a specific campaign or action.

It is a way to measure a campaign's effectiveness or impact by comparing the conversion goal performance for users who received your campaigns (Target Group) to that of users who were not sent the message (Control Group).

Uplift can help you in the following ways:

Analyze campaign performance (from impressions to conversions) with multiple attribution models like View-through attribution (x hours from impressions), Click attribution (x hours from clicks), and In-session attribution.
Create and validate experiments using multivariate testing.
Measure true uplift on the business metric against a control group.
Control Group Uplift

Control group uplift refers to the increase or decrease in the desired metric observed within the control group when comparing it with the target group. In campaign analytics, a control group is a group of individuals who do not receive the campaign or action being analyzed, while the target group refers to those who are exposed to the campaign. By comparing the results of both groups, you can determine the incremental impact of the campaign on the desired metric. The control group uplift helps evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign by considering the difference between the target and control groups.

Global Control Group Uplift

Global control group uplift refers to the uplift observed when analyzing the results of the entire customer base or a large sample of customers who were not exposed to the campaign. In this case, the entire customer base or a significant portion of it acts as the control group, while the target group consists of customers who were targeted with the campaign. The global control group uplift provides a broader measure of the campaign's impact across a larger audience, helping to assess the overall effectiveness of the campaign.

Positive and Negative Uplift

An uplift (control group uplift or global control group uplift) can be positive or negative. A positive uplift indicates that the campaign or action had a positive impact and led to better results compared to not running the campaign or taking that action. On the other hand, a negative uplift indicates that the campaign or action had a negative impact and led to worse results compared to not running the campaign or taking that action.

Both positive and negative uplift provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of campaigns and help you optimize your strategies.

Calculate Uplift Percentage

info	

Information

For Push campaigns,
The conversion rate (CVR) is calculated using the following formula: 

(Unique Conversions)/ (Total Impression)
(Unique Conversions)/ (Total Clicks)
For SMS campaigns,
The conversion rate (CVR) is calculated using the following formula:
(Unique Conversion/Total Sent)*100
If delivery is enabled, (Unique Conversion/Total Delivered)*100
For Email campaigns,
The conversion rate (CVR) is calculated using the following formula: 

(Converted Users/Total Unique Open)*100
(Converted Users/Total Click)*100
View the Uplift in Campaign Analytics

On the campaign analytics page, you can view uplift under the following analytics for each campaign:

Campaign performance stats: The uplift percentage in performance stats indicates the primary conversion goal and the uplift of that primary conversion goal against the control group.

Locale/Variation performance: The uplift percentage in Locale/Variation performance indicates the uplift of each conversion goal for each variation or locale against the control group.

Conversion goal performance: The uplift percentage in performance stats indicates the uplift of each conversion goal against the control group.

FAQs 
How are users distributed between the target and control groups in MoEngage?
In MoEngage, users are distributed between target and control groups based on the percentage specified during the campaign setup. Before the distribution takes place, MoEngage also excludes users who are ineligible to receive notifications due to factors such as frequency limits, communication preferences, or reachability constraints. This ensures that the right users are included in each group for effective testing and measurement of campaign performance.
Why does MoEngage use different baselines for calculating conversion rates (impressions for the target group and active targets for the control group)?
MoEngage utilizes different baselines for calculating conversion rates to provide precise reporting on the impact of notifications on desired actions, such as purchases or successful transactions. By using impressions for the target group, MoEngage assesses the impact of notifications that were successfully delivered to users. Conversely, by using active targets for the control group, MoEngage evaluates the typical behavior of users who did not receive notifications. 

This distinct approach in baselines is crucial for accurately determining the uplift generated by the push notification campaign. It allows for a clear comparison between the behavior of users who received notifications and those who did not, enabling more accurate insights into the campaign's performance and effectiveness."

Create an Event-Triggered Campaign
Overview

Do you want to remind your users about their booked flight 2 hours before the flight time? Do you want to remind users about the item they added to the cart but have not purchased in the last 1 hour? Do you want them to recharge their mobile data pack 2 days before it expires?

You can achieve such scenarios using event-triggered campaigns. They allow you to send personalized messages/notifications triggered by different user action events tracked on the app or server. Using event-triggered campaigns, you can target users at the right moment and in the right context, increasing the chances of their engagement.

Use Cases

The following are some use cases you can achieve with event-triggered campaigns:

Send an order confirmation message after the users complete a purchase
Re-engage Funnel drop-offs (cart drop-offs, subscription drop-offs, payment drop-offs, and so on)
Send reminders (with discounts) to your subscribers before the subscription expiry
Send a message (SMS or RCS) when the user opens the app and does not make a purchase within two hours of opening the app
Remind users about the expiry of their subscription that they bought last month 1 day before the expiry date
Send communication minutes before a flash sale to shoppers who have registered for it
Send a message to users who booked a flight ticket to a particular city to cross-sell hotels, experiences, local transport, restaurant bookings
Remind users who buy medicines to reorder them before they end

Select the Use intelligent delay optimization check box to optimize the delay in real-time for the campaign to be sent after the user event conditions are satisfied. This option is available only in the Push campaign. For more information, refer to Trigger Delay Optimization.

 

Campaign with Only the Primary Condition

MoEngage allows you to execute time-sensitive messages. You can immediately send campaigns with only ""if"" conditions. These campaigns can send the message based on a single trigger event within a few minutes of the defined trigger action.

For example, send a confirmation email immediately after a purchase is done.

Campaign with Multiple Primary Conditions

MoEngage allows you to configure event-triggered campaigns based on multiple primary conditions. A user becomes eligible to receive the campaign after completing any one of the event triggers. Under Primary trigger event(s), you can add multiple events with ""OR"" by clicking + Add alternate trigger event. For example, to send a message if the user has executed the Added to Cart event or the Added to Wishlist event, you can configure the conditions as shown below: 

info	

Information

Configuring event-triggered campaigns based on multiple primary conditions is available for Push, Email, WhatsApp, and Connectors.

Campaign with Primary and Secondary Conditions

MoEngage allows you to configure event triggers based on multiple conditions. You can define a primary ""if"" condition and a secondary ""AND"" condition. For example, you can send a message if the user adds a product to the cart but does not purchase it within a specific period of time. An example condition to trigger the event looks as follows:

If the user has executed the Added to Cart event AND has not executed the Product Purchased event in the past 30 days from the Added to Cart event, then trigger the message.

Configure Triggers with a Trigger Event Property

With event triggers, you can trigger the message for specified values of the event attribute in your IF event. For instance, you want to remind users who have booked a flight 2 hours before the flight time. You must create a trigger on the Flight Booked event using the event property flight_time and set the notification to be sent 2 hours before the flight time.

To create a trigger:

In the IF user section, in the Has Executed list, click the flight booked event as shown below:

In the THEN trigger the message section, set the result for a message to be sent 2 hours before the flight time as shown below:

info	

Information

Event-triggered campaigns are sent only when:

The event property or attribute, which is used to create these types of triggers (such as flight_time in the previous example), is in a valid date-time format. Here are the supported formats. If the selected attributes do not contain data in any of these formats, the campaigns are not sent to the users.
The date or time value from the attribute is greater than the time at which the trigger condition is fulfilled.
The date or time value from the attribute is less than 30 Days + the time at which the trigger condition is fulfilled. For example, if your trigger condition is fulfilled at date D, the notification is sent only when the attribute value is less than D+30.
The intelligent delay optimization (only for Push campaigns under With Delay) does not work for campaigns sent on relative timing.
The event attribute-based sending is applicable only when there is a single primary trigger event.  
Define your Target audience

Define your target audience by selecting the User property, User behavior, or any of the following options as shown below.

When creating campaigns, if the attributes in the target audience contain multiple data types, it is highly recommended to pin the data type in the data management page. Otherwise, the number of users who receive the communication could be inconsistent.



info	

Mark the allowed data types of your event and user attributes. This will ensure the appropriate operators are available for them during segmentation and analytics.

Once you have defined the allowed data type of your attributes, MoEngage will try to typecast the incoming data to the set data type. You can define the data type in data management.

Overview - Business Events
Introduction

MoEngage's Business Events allow marketers to create events that are based on business actions rather than user actions and run campaigns when these events occur. 

Event-Triggered vs. Business Event-Triggered Campaigns

Both event-triggered and business event-triggered campaigns are triggered based on the occurrence of an event. However, the event in the case of an event-triggered campaign is initiated by a user action, while for a business event, the event is executed at the business end.

For instance, a campaign that is triggered based on an event, such as Web Page Viewed, is based on a user action, where the user views a specific web page. A Back in Stock campaign is based on when the brand has refilled its stock of a commodity and wishes to communicate the same to its customers. Thus, the event or action here happens at the brand's end, and Business Events help businesses create such events in MoEngage.

info	

Note

Business Events are supported on the following channels: Push, SMS, and Email.

How are events occurring at the business end handled currently?

Let's consider the example of an E-commerce platform where thousands of products run out of stock and are restocked on a day-to-day basis. If ten products are back in stock and brands wish to reach out to customers who've asked to be notified about the same, here is what marketers do:

Create a segment for each of the back-in-stock items by mapping the item code or product id of the item that is back in stock with the product id of the item that is in stock
Personalize the content for each back-in-stock product
Publish the campaign

Creating a new campaign every time a product is back in stock leads to a lot of manual effort, which in turn leaves a lot of room for errors and misses. The need of the hour is a means to reduce manual effort and overheads, and this is where Business Events come into play - you can do all of the above with just a single campaign!

How do Business Events work?

If you were to run a back-in-stock campaign with business events, you would have to do the following:

Create a business event called BackInStock with event attributes such as productid and product name. The productid is unique to every product in the merchandise.
Segment users - In a back-in-stock campaign, we will notify users who have viewed the product or clicked on notify me. Let's take the case where the user has viewed the product. In this system, this would translate to the user having executed a ViewedProduct event, and the productid of the product would be available in the event attribute for this event. To create a dynamic segment that sends a notification to users who've viewed any out-of-stock product, we'd have to create a segment that dynamically maps the productid event attribute with the business event's productid attribute.
Create a business event-triggered campaign and associate it with the BackInStock event.
Trigger the BackInStock event whenever an item is restocked.

Such a campaign would be run whenever the item is restocked, and a marketer needn't create multiple campaigns for the same. Instead of running a hundred different campaigns, they could simply configure one and run it automatically once the item is back in stock!

Business Event Triggered Campaigns
Overview

Business event-triggered campaigns are triggered based on business events created in the system. To create a business event-triggered campaign and communicate with the customer, do the following:

Create a Business Event - a one-time affair where your brand can create all the necessary events in MoEngage using the API.
Create Business Event Triggered Campaign - use the event created during campaign creation to tie the campaign to the business event
Trigger the Business Event

Consider the following scenarios:

A new series is being released on an OTT platform, and the same needs to be communicated to users who watch similar content. This can be facilitated using Business Event Triggers.
Whenever a product is back in stock, the information needs to be communicated to users who've viewed the product previously.
When a flight or train is delayed, the information needs to be communicated to users who have purchased a ticket.
Create the Business Event

You can create a business event named NewSeriesAlert using the Create Business Event API. A sample payload for the same is shown below.

		  }

	    ],

	    ""created_by"": ""john.doe@example.com""

	}'

Now that the Business Event is available, we can proceed with campaign creation.

Create a Business Event-Triggered Campaign
Push
SMS & RCS
Email Campaigns
Flows

Let's take the case of products that are back in stock and communicate the information to users using Push Notifications.

To create a Business-Event triggered Push campaign:

Navigate to the Push Campaign Creation page from Engage -> Campaigns -> +Create Campaign -> Outbound -> Push
Choose the delivery type as Business Event-Triggered
Add the team (if teams are configured for the account), campaign name, and tags to the campaign creation page.
Click on the event (BackInStock) created in the Select Business Event dropdown.
In the Segmentation section, match the user or event attribute(s) with that of the business event's attribute(s) dynamically, as shown below. This is where you can leverage the power of dynamic segmentation and use a single campaign for numerous business events. For example, consider a back-in-stock business event. If a user has viewed a product that was out of stock, you can map one or more of its attributes( product id, product name, item code, product URL, product image, brand, category) with that of the business event's attribute. Thus, all you would need is a single campaign where you can map the business event's attribute with that of the user or event attribute. Whenever a business event is triggered for any product that is back in stock, this campaign would be run.

User Property - User properties or user attributes are matched with event attributes using this option. If there is a user property or attribute that stores the product id, you can match that with that of the business event attribute that contains the product id of the back-in-stock product for which the event is being triggered.

 

 

Note: For Array attributes, the following operators are supported in segmentation for Business Events: exists, does not exist, (any of) in the following, (all of) in the following, not in the following.

User Behavior - You can choose target audiences who've viewed products that were out of stock in the past twenty-five days and match the attributes of products viewed by them with those of the products that are now back in stock. In the example shown below, we've matched the product names, brands, and item codes of the products viewed by users to those of the products that are now back in stock using Business Event Attributes.

 

User Affinity segments can be used to recommend products to users who have displayed an affinity for a certain product in the past. In the example shown below, the back-in-stock products are shown to those users who have viewed the product in the past three days.

 

Add the platforms and control group for the campaign (optional) and move to the next step of campaign creation.
Create the content for the Push campaign and add the delivery schedule in the next step. You can personalize the message, title, and summary with the business event's attributes. For more information, refer to Personalization.
In step 3 of campaign creation:
Select the Start date and End date of the campaign along with the timezone in which it has to be sent.
Add conversion goals as desired.
Add delivery controls to ignore frequency capping and override the default throttling limits for the campaign.
Publish the campaign. This campaign will be sent to customers once the business event is triggered.
info	

Note

Since the segmentation is dynamic, you cannot view the number of reachable users during the campaign or flow creation. It is calculated at run time based on the business event being triggered. For example, if we target users who prefer comedy and wish to inform them about an upcoming comedy series, only those users who've watched comedy or who prefer comedy would be sent the email based on their qualifying in the dynamic segment defined for the campaign.
For segmentation to work, the datatypes of the event attributes, or user properties used in segmentation should match those of the business event's attribute. If the attributes do not match, segmentation will not be run, and the campaigns will not be sent to users.
You can also send business event-triggered campaigns or flows for all the users in the system using the All Users segmentation option.
You can look up information for up to sixty days in the segmentation filters for Business Events.
Trigger the Business Event

To trigger the Business Event, use the Trigger Business Event API.

	  ""cast"": [""John Doe"", ""Jane Doe""],

	  ""genre"": ""Comedy""

	  },

	  ""triggered_by"": ""john.doe@example.com""

	  }

You don't have to send all the attributes when triggering the Business Event. Once the trigger is active, the campaign will be received by the user, and you can see the analytics for the same in the Campaign Analytics and Info page of the respective campaign. Business Event campaigns are sent in a manner similar to that of any event-triggered campaign in MoEngage."

Campaign Content
Content APIs
Overview

For any successful marketing campaign, one of the key ingredients is the relevance of the campaign goal to the recipient. Content APIs allow you to create campaigns that are personalized dynamically using the data fetched at send time from your recommendations or coupon or other Personalization APIs.

Such targeted, relevant, and timely communication has been proven to have much better engagement and conversion rates when compared to generic campaigns.

As shown in the example below, if a user books a flight, Dynamic Content APIs can be used to send emails to them with offers on hotel accommodation for the destination, keeping in mind the accommodation preferences of the user within a few hours of booking the flight.

Such personalized, relevant emails can be used to drive conversion and unlock up-sell and cross-sell opportunities in many scenarios.

Let’s look at another example where a user has left a hotel booking incomplete in their shopping cart while looking for resorts in Bali. In this case, the website where the user has added items to their cart(in this case, the hotel room) triggers an email reminding them to complete the transaction, as well as making recommendations about similar hotels for them to choose from. Targeted, contextual, and personalized emails like this are an extremely useful tool for a marketer looking to grow their business.

Using Content APIs in MoEngage

Let’s take a look at how MoEngage allows you to have rich, personalized, timely conversations with your customers by creating automated campaigns to address the above-mentioned use case (users viewing the details of a hotel but not making the booking). To do this, you need to follow a three-step process:

Add an API to MoEngage
Create a personalized campaign using the API
Run the campaign
info	

Information

If your endpoints are in a VPC/are not accessible publicly, you must whitelist these MoEngage IPs depending on the region of your Workspace. 

Step 1 – Adding the API URL

To set up an API to be used during MoEngage campaigns, refer to Add a Content API.

Step 2 - Using Content APIs to Create Personalized Campaigns

Once the API URL is saved, users can start creating campaigns using any existing content templates with API calls embedded in the content. These campaigns can contain placeholders for different SKUs (in this case, hotels), along with the required formatting, segmentation, and triggering schedules.

Content APIs can be added to the campaigns sent using the following channels:

Push (Mobile and Web Push)
Email
SMS
On-Site Messaging
In-App
Whatsapp
Connectors

For more information on personalizing content using content APIs, refer here.

Example of Content API

Let's take the example of a case where a marketer wants to use weather-related information to target users in a particular geography for an email campaign. In the example below, a marketer from an e-commerce company wishes to drive sales for the Autumn line of products (scarves, boots, coats, and what have you) the company is promoting in the London region by sending an email campaign. The marketer uses a content API that fetches the weather information for London and uses it in the content section during campaign creation.

Step 1: Configure Content API

Here are the steps to configure the Weather Content API.

Navigate to the Content API settings and configure the API.
We have used the below-mentioned API to fetch the weather details using a weather API. The API takes in two parameters the APPID (this is the Application ID of the Weather API we have used, which has been hosted on a 3rd party site) and the city name.
API Name: Weather
API URL: http://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
Once the API Name and URL are entered, the parameters to be passed can be entered.
In this example, the parameters added are the city name and the APPID. The city name can either be static, where we enter the name of the city to be passed to the API, or this can be personalized and fetched from the user attributes by entering '@' in the Value textbox.
The user's city will be fetched using personalization while sending the campaign(when the user attribute city is chosen using personalization, this is represented as {{UserAttribute['LastKnownCity']}} in the value text field).
Click Update.
The Edit Content API page opens.
To mask PII fields select Yes and then choose the preferred field names for which you want to mask the information, and then select Done. you can now mask PII value from Content API output. For more information, see here.

Once saved, this Content API is added to the Content API search listing. It can now be used to create content for any campaign.
Step 2: Test the Content API
Click the Content API created in the search listing of the Content API screen.
Click the  at the end of the row to view the Test option. 

Click Test.
Click Test at the bottom right corner of the screen. This would pass the parameters to the configured ContentAPI and show the generated response, as shown below.  


Note: In this example, we are using the Content API with the static parameter for the city name.
The JSON response generated for this API is shown below.

	          ],

	          ""coord"": {

	          ""lat"": 51.51,

	          ""lon"": -0.13

	          },

	          ""base"": ""stations"",

	          ""dt"": 1485789600,

	          ""main"": {

	          ""pressure"": 1012,

	          ""temp_min"": 279.15,

	          ""temp_max"": 281.15,

	          ""temp"": 280.32,

	          ""humidity"": 81

	          },

	          ""id"": 2643743,

	          ""wind"": {

	          ""speed"": 4.1,

	          ""deg"": 80}

	          ,

	          ""cod"": 200

	          }

The response contains details such as the description, wind speed, humidity, temperature, visibility, and a description of the weather (light intensity drizzle) in this case. This response can be parsed using JINJA and can be used during content creation, as shown in the step below.

Step 3: Use the Content API during campaign creation.

Create a one-time email campaign with the desired target segment, and in the content creation step (step 2 of campaign creation), do the following.

Choose the desired template. In the example shown below, an e-commerce template that has product recommendations for the autumn line has been chosen. 

In the text area, type the desired content.
For illustration, we have chosen the following sample text for this email campaign.

""The weather is inclement and the forecast for the next few days is <add conteAPIapi call and parse the response to get the description detail from the API>.

 

Why venture out for shopping when you can take a look at our top picks for you from the cozy confines of your home?""

Use the following JINJA to invoke the Content API named 'Weather' and parse through its response to get the weather description.
{%set weatherAPI = ContentApi.Weather({ ({""params"":{""q"":""London,uk"",""appid"":""""}, ""static_params"":{},""dynamic_params"":{},""request_body"":{}}) }) %}
The weatherAPI variable would now contain the JSON response shown above while testing the content API. To get to the description field in this response, use the following code:
{% for weather in weatherAPI.weather %} {{weather.description}} {% endfor %}
Add the product recommendations and other necessary content. Click on 'Preview' in the top right-hand corner of the editor. The preview screen opens up as shown below. 

Click on the Personalized Tab in the top pane to see the personalized content as shown below.
Note: We have not added any personalization in this example. However, the content API will be run, and the weather information will be fetched and used in the content, as can be seen below. In case there are any user attributes that have been personalized, they will be fetched for a random user chosen from the segment chosen for the campaign. Click here for more details about personalization. 

Select the delivery schedules and the goals in the next step of the campaign and publish the campaign.

Localize Campaign Messages
Overview

Localizing your campaign message allows you to send different types of communication targeting different languages, cultures, and region-specific audiences from a single campaign, personalized based on their interests, region, and language. Localizing campaign messages to meet the linguistic and cultural expectations of a specific target audience can help your brand better engage them.

Example

To communicate with users from around the world for a product release or seasonal sale, you can create a campaign with multiple locales to target audiences in different regions with different languages to drive engagement.

Locales allow you to adapt your message within a single campaign to resonate with different audience segments based on their language, geographic location, age, or gender. This allows you to:

Deliver the same message to users in multiple languages.
Send different messages tailored to various geographic regions.
Adapt your communication for specific age groups or genders.

Embracing Accessibility With MoEngage
Overview

Accessibility means ensuring everyone can access and interact with your online content regardless of their abilities. It involves creating content and design that is clear and easy to understand, use, and enjoy.

Importance of Accessibility

Positive brand image: A website that is easily accessible to everyone is essential for any business. It sends a positive message to customers and prospects and demonstrates your commitment to providing a seamless online experience. Treating everyone with empathy and inclusivity may lay the groundwork for long-term relationships.

Boost conversion: Providing a positive user experience for your visitors can help expand the reach of your products and services, increasing the likelihood of achieving maximum conversions. Websites that are accessible have the potential to rank higher in search engine results, which can potentially lead to increased traffic to your site.

Market Share of People with Diverse Abilities

Market research suggests that 80% of customers would pay more for the same product on a website that is more accessible.
The online spending power of consumers who require accessible content is €30 billion.
An estimated 1.3 billion people experience significant disability, representing 16% of the world's population (one in six of us), according to WHO.
Areas of Disability to Consider

Your website and app should be accessible to everyone, including those with:

impaired vision
motor difficulties
cognitive impairments
learning disabilities
deafness or impaired hearing
speech disabilities
physical disabilities
Barriers and Solutions 

There are a few things you can do as a business, team, designer, product owner, or marketer to guarantee that your website or app is accessible to consumers with a wide range of abilities. Not only is this the ethical thing to do (and WCAG-compliant), but it will also help you build a memorable and positive user experience and increase customer loyalty. 

Hearing

Hearing disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or both ears to extensive and irreversible hearing loss in both ears. 

In order for your website or app to be accessible to people with auditory difficulties, it must provide the following features:

Transcripts and captions of audio content, including audio-only content and audio tracks in multimedia;
Media players that display captions and provide options to adjust the text size and colors of captions;
Options to stop, pause, and adjust the volume of audio content (independently of the system volume);
High-quality foreground audio that is clearly distinguishable from any background noise.
Visual

Visual disabilities range from mild or moderate vision loss in one or both eyes to severe and uncorrectable vision loss in both. 

People with visual difficulties frequently rely on changing the presentation of web content to make it more usable for their specific requirements. Make sure your website or app is set up so that they can:

Enlarge or reduce text size and images;
Customize settings for fonts, colors, and spacing;
Listen to text-to-speech synthesis of the content;
Listen to audio descriptions of video in multimedia;
Read text using refreshable Braille.
Speech

Speech difficulties include the inability to produce speech that can be recognized by people or voice recognition software.

People with speech impairments require alternative means of interaction. To ensure that you deliver the same level of experience for them, you can provide:

Text-based chat with representatives;
Keyboard commands to operate web applications;
E-mail and feedback forms.
Physical

Physical disabilities include muscular weakness and limitations, sensory limitations, joint problems (such as arthritis), pain that limits movement, and missing limbs. To make it easier for people with physical limitations to use your website or app, make the following provisions:

Full keyboard support;
Enough time to respond or complete tasks like online forms;
Visual and non-visual orienting cues, page structure, and other navigational aids;
Predictable, user-friendly page navigation and functions.

For more information, refer to Web Accessibility Initiative's Diverse Abilities and Barriers.

Accessibility Regulations
Country / Region	Regulation
UK	The Equality Act of 2010 states that all UK service providers must consider 'reasonable adjustments' for disabled people.
USA	Web accessibility regulations are covered under various federal laws, including the American Disabilities Act (ADA), which requires that companies make accommodations for disabled users with specific regard to web accessibility.
EU	The European Accessibility Act requires that all businesses operating in the E-commerce sector meet minimum accessibility requirements.
Worldwide	The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) have been developed to provide a set of core principles and minimum standards to meet the needs of consumers internationally. These guidelines define how content should be adopted by organizations globally.
Best Practices 

There are several steps you can take to ensure that your website and app are accessible to people with a wide range of abilities. Feel free to use this checklist as a starting point. 

Add captions to the content: Adding captions and subtitles to your brand videos or customer testimonials on your website or social media increases engagement. It is also beneficial for SEO because it lets search engines crawl and understand your website's content. 
Provide alt text for images: Alt text is a brief image description. People who use screen readers can better understand your website, and search engines use it while indexing it.  If your image doesn't load, alt text appears.  
Use high-contrast colors: Some people may have difficulties viewing text if the color contrast is low. Thus, high-contrast colors like black and white or black and yellow are recommended. Your text should stand out rather than blend in with the background.
Organize content using heading hierarchies: Organize your content into sections with clear headings to make it easier to read. This also aids in-page navigation and allows users to browse your page's content using assistive technologies.
Make your website user-friendly: Additional steps to make user interface and visual design more accessible to people with disabilities include:
Ensure that navigation across pages on a website has consistent naming, styling, and positioning.
Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as links and buttons, to make them easy to identify.
Provide feedback for interactions, such as confirming form submission, alerting the user when something goes wrong, or notifying the user of changes to the page.

Message Personalization
Overview
Introduction

Personalization is a method of tailoring marketing messages to individual users to improve engagement and conversion rates. By addressing users by name, referencing their past interactions, or showing products they viewed, businesses create more relevant and meaningful connections with their users.

This approach helps differentiate campaigns in a crowded market, fostering more robust user relationships and boosting open rates, retention, and overall campaign effectiveness.

As a marketer, you can personalize the content of your campaign in MoEngage. You can personalize one or multiple attributes in the same message or image.

Use Cases
Connect better with users: Send personalized messages that address them by their first name and reference their last activity.
Boost revenue: Create and send unique coupon codes for individual users to incentivize purchases.
Retarget customers effectively: Show personalized images of products users viewed but did not purchase based on their browsing history, prompting them to reconsider.
Improve buyer targeting: Use personalized product images for users who viewed but did not buy, encouraging them to complete their purchase.
Improve substantial brand reputation: Tailor your messages to highlight products relevant to each customer, enhancing their perception of your brand.
Ways to Personalize Content

You can personalize content in two ways in MoEngage:

Using the editor
Using the JINJA templating language
Personalize Content Using the Editor

The following procedure describes how to personalize content using the editor:

In step 2 of campaign creation, in the content section, type @ to insert personalization in any field value.
The Personalization page appears, where you can configure your content based on which parameters you want to personalize. 
On the Data Personalization tab, in the Select Attribute list, click the relevant user attribute value.
For the selected user attribute, define a fallback value to be used in case the personalization fails for some reason. The following options are supported:
No fallback: Defines that there’s no alternative value when the personalization does not work.
Do not send: Defines that the content won't be sent if the personalization does not work.
Replace text: After selecting this option, in the Fallback text field, type or paste the text to be used when the personalization does not work.
Select Done.
Personalize Content Using the Jinja Templating Language

MoEngage templating language is based on Jinja, the popular and simple templating language that provides you with the highest degree of control over your customization and personalization requirements. For more information, refer to MoEngage Templating language (JINJA).

info	

Note

MoEngage currently supports Jinja version 2.8.

For example, the following Jinja code defines how to get the first product from a product set: 

Jinja
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% if ProductSet.Observabilitytests%}{{ProductSet.Observabilitytests[0].description}}{% else %}MOE_NOT_SEND{% endif %}
Defining Fallback

In the MoEngage email templates, a message containing a null value will not be sent. Hence, you must assign default fallback values to avoid such situations. In the following example, if you don’t have the user’s location, MoEngage will not send the message:

	Welcome to {{ UserAttribute['Location'] }}

To ensure that messages are sent in such a situation, you must provide a default fallback value that is returned by the variable in case the value is null. The MoEngage email template displays an overlay pop-up with different options to handle situations where an attribute returns a null.

The option you select will be automatically used while sending messages based on the value returned. If a default value is provided, the personalized message looks like this:

Welcome, {{ UserAttribute['First name']|default('Guest') }}

Alternatively, you can also use the following code:

Jinja
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% set firstName = UserAttribute['First name'] %}

	      {% if firstName %}

	      Welcome, {{ firstName }}

	      {% else %}

	      Welcome!

	      {% endif %}
Types of Personalization

You can personalize your content using the following elements:

User Attributes

You can tailor messages based on user characteristics like location and preferences, ensuring each user receives relevant content.

For example, personalized emails have higher open rates and conversions because they leverage the email context and are relevant. You can personalize your email campaigns based on user attributes, such as name, location, or other attributes (for both general and event-triggered emails).

Examples
Name Personalization

To remind users of their last activity (viewed product, purchased product), address users by their first name:


Image Personalization

To sell the product the user viewed but not purchased, send them a personalized image:


Coupon Code Personalization

To send a unique coupon code to every user, you must save the user-level coupon as a custom attribute and use it in personalization. In the example, a unique user-specific coupon code is saved in an attribute named Promo Code.


Key-Value Pair Personalization

When you want to pass a unique user attribute to the app and make a decision based on that, the defined key-value pair can be used to pre-fill feedback forms, user surveys, and so on.


warning	

Warning

The examples use sample attribute names. These names are not standard and depend on how you save them in MoEngage.

URL Personalization

You can also personalize the URLs or deep links where you redirect the user when they click a link. 

In the Template Editor section, click Link personalization.



In the text box that appears, type @. 
In the Personalization dialog box, on the Data personalization tab, click the attribute and then click Done.

You can then copy this link and paste it, wherever required, into the HTML code.

info	

Note

If the personalized URL fails to find/resolve the user attribute, the email will not be sent to the user. There is no fallback mechanism for personalized URLs. If you have any issues creating personalized email campaigns, you can raise a support ticket.

Event Attributes

You can personalize content by leveraging user interactions, such as app usage or past purchases, to deliver timely and relevant messages.

Event attribute-based personalization is available only for event-triggered campaigns. For example, if a user performs the Add to Cart event but does not complete the purchase, you can apply specific rules based on the event. When these rules match, MoEngage will display a message using the event’s attributes. The Account registered event is an example in the following image:

Business Event Attributes

You can use details from specific business events, like transactions or bookings, to create personalized notifications and reminders for users.

info	

Information

For all channels that support personalization, business event attribute-based personalization is supported only for business event-triggered campaigns.

Examples
For Business Event Triggered Push Campaigns

In business event-triggered Push campaigns, you can use the attribute of the business event that is mapped to the campaign to personalize the campaign. To do so:

Type @ in the content creation step to invoke the personalization editor.
The attributes of the Business Event mapped to the campaign are shown under the Business Event Attribute heading, as shown below:



Choose the attribute to be used for personalization and customize the message.

Personalization with business events can be a big difference in effort and automation, as you can use one template and send multiple campaigns with it. For example, you can communicate information about three new web series that are being launched with the same campaign. You can use the event attributes to personalize the message for each series by using the series name, image, cast, and air date to send the communication to your dynamic segment (that matches the user interest (say, preferred genre) to that of the genre of the series).

Campaign Attributes

You can create personalized content by adjusting messages based on campaign-specific details for reporting or analysis purposes. For example, you can add personalization to the Email campaign content by configuring the following attributes as dynamic attributes:

Campaign ID
Campaign name
Campaign tags

Recommendations

You can deliver personalized product set recommendations by selecting items from your catalog that align with user preferences, demographics, and shopping history. This approach tailors suggestions to meet individual customer needs, enhancing engagement and potential sales. For more information, see here.

Example

Content APIs

You can create personalized campaigns using Content APIs, which fetch data dynamically when sending messages based on recommendations, coupons, or other personalization APIs. This targeted and timely communication significantly improves engagement and conversion rates compared to generic campaigns. For more information, refer to Personalize Content Using Content APIs.

Example

Content Blocks

You can use predefined content blocks to maintain consistency while tailoring messages with personalized text or visuals for each user. For more information, refer to Personalize Content Using Content Blocks.

Example

Auxiliary Data Attributes

Using auxiliary data points can provide deeper personalization, offering users a more tailored and context-rich experience. For more information, refer to Personalize Content Using Auxiliary Data.

Example

Message Personalization
Jinja Templating Language

MoEngage Templating Language is based on Jinja, the popular and simple templating language that enables you to have the highest degree of control over your customization and personalization requirements.

info	

Note

MoEngage currently supports Jinja version 2.8. 

 

Variables

Variables can also be expressions, which evaluate a new variable. Anything inside double brackets is evaluated and inserted into the final content. 

Often a variable is a collection of attributes. In the MoEngage email template, these attributes can be accessed using a dot operator:

Jinja
.

Or with a subscript notation:

Jinja
[]

To insert variables, enclose them in double braces. For example, to insert the user attribute labeled FirstName:

Jinja
{{UserAttribute['First Name']}}

For example, UserAttributes is a collection of all attributes belonging to the current user. If you want to insert the value of the attribute FirstName, use the following code:

Jinja
Welcome, {{UserAttribute['First Name']}}

 

info	

Note

It is recommended to use the subscript notation when using Jinja.
If the defined attribute that you are using contains spaces, you must use the subscript notation. For example:
Welcome, {{UserAttribute['First Name']}}

 

Expressions

MoEngage supports basic expressions everywhere. Expressions can be used to create variables from other variables or expressions, such as by performing mathematical, logical, or other operations.

To use Expressions or Statements, enclose them as follows:

Jinja
{% %}
Literals

Literals are the simplest form of expression. Literals represent variables such as strings and numbers. The following literals exist:

Literal	Description
“Hello World”	Everything between two double or single quotes is a string. They are useful whenever you need a string in the template (e.g. as arguments to function calls and filters, or just to extend or include a template).
42 / 42.23	Integers and floating-point numbers are created by just writing the number down. If a dot is present, the number is a float, otherwise an integer. Keep in mind that 42 and 42.0 are different (int and float, respectively).
['list', 'of', 'objects']	

Everything between two brackets is a list. Lists are useful for storing sequential data to be iterated over. For example, you can easily create a list of links using lists and tuples for (and with) a for loop:

<ul> {% for href, caption in [ ('index.html', 'Index'), ('about.html', 'About'), ('downloads.html', 'Downloads') ] %} <li><a href=""{{ href }}""> {{ caption }} </a></li> {% endfor %} </ul>


{'dictionary': 'of', 'key':
'and', 'value': 'pairs'}	

A dictionary combines keys and values. Keys must be unique and always have exactly one value. Dictionaries are rarely created, but they’re used when reading data from other sources.


true/false	

true is always true, and false is always false.

 

Math

MoEngage allows you to calculate with values. The following operators are supported:

Operator	

Description


+	

Adds two objects together. Usually, the objects are numbers, but if both are strings or lists, you can concatenate them this way.


-	

Subtract the second number from the first one. {{ 3 - 2 }} is 1.


/	

Divide two numbers. The return value will be a floating-point number. {{ 1 / 2 }}is {{ 0.5 }}.


%	

Calculate the remainder of an integer division. {{ 11 % 7 }} is 4.


*	

Multiply the left operand by the right one. {{ 2 * 2 }} would return 4.

 

Comparisons
Operator	

Description


==	

Compares two objects for equality.


!=	

Compares two objects for inequality.


>	

True if the left-hand side is greater than the right-hand side.


>=	

True if the left-hand side is greater than or equal to the right-hand side.


<	

True if the left-hand side is lower than the right-hand side.


<=	

True if the left-hand side is lower or equal to the right-hand side.

 

Logic

For if statements, filtering, and if expressions, it can be useful to combine multiple expressions:

Operator	Description
and	Return true if the left and the right operands are true.
or	

Return true if the left or the right operand is true. Or can also be used to deal with default values. For example, the following will return the user’s name if it exists; otherwise, it will return the user’s email:

{{ UserAttribute.name or UserAttribute.email }}
not	Negate a statement
(expr)	Group an expression.

 

Expression Tests

Tests can be used to test a variable against a common expression. To test a variable or expression, add is and the name of the test after the variable.

For example, to find out if a variable is defined, you can do ""name is defined"", which will then return true or false depending on whether the name is defined in the current context of the template.

Tests can also accept arguments. If the test only takes one argument, you can leave out the parentheses. For example, the following two expressions do the same thing:

Jinja
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% if loop.index is divisibleby 3 %}

	{% if loop.index is divisibleby(3) %}

For more information, refer to Jinja Pallets.

Comments

To comment out part of a line in a template, use the comment syntax, which is by default set to {# ... #}. This is useful to comment out parts of the template for debugging or to add information for other template designers or yourself:

Jinja
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% # note: commented-out template because we no longer use this

	   {% for user in users %}

	       ...

	   {% endfor %}

	# %}
 
Assignments

Inside code blocks, you can also assign values to variables. Assignments at the top level (outside of blocks, macros, or loops) are exported from the template like top-level macros and can be imported by other templates.

Assignments use the set tag and can have multiple targets:

Jinja
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% set navigation = [('index.html', 'Index'), ('about.html', 'About')] %}

	{% set key, value = call_something() %}

 

Conditional statements, loops
One can also use the custom variable with a loop; Tags control the logic of the template and can perform conditional statements, loops, macros, and so on.

Sample Loop
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% set products = [{‘name’: ‘Nike’, ‘href’: 'https://www.example.com/nike'}, {‘name’: ‘Adidas’, ‘href’: 'https://www.example.com/adidas'}] %}{% for product in products %}		

	    <li><a href=""{{ product.href }}"">{{ product.name }}</a></li>

	{% endfor %}

Sample condition

{% if products %}
<p>The products are not empty.</p>
{% else %}
<p>The products are empty.</p>
{% endif %}

Escaping

It is sometimes desirable (even necessary) to have MoEngage ignore parts it would otherwise handle as variables or blocks. For example, if, with the default syntax, you want to use {{ as a raw string in a template and not to start a variable, you must use a trick.

The easiest way to output a literal variable delimiter

Jinja
{{

 is by using a variable expression:

Jinja
{{ '{{' }}

 

HTML Escaping

When generating HTML from templates, there is always a risk that a variable will include characters that affect the resulting HTML.

It’s your responsibility to escape variables if needed. What to escape? If you have a variable that may include any of the following characters

Jinja
>, <, &, or ""

you must escape it unless the variable contains well-formed and trusted HTML. Escaping works by piping the variable through the

Jinja
|e

filter:

Jinja
{{UserAttribute['First Name']|e}}

Control Structures

A control structure refers to all those things that control the flow of a program:

conditionals (that is, if/elif/else)
for-loops
macros and blocks

With the default syntax, control structures appear inside

Jinja
{% ... %}

blocks.

For

Loop over each item in a sequence. For example, to display a list of users provided in a variable called users:

HTML
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	<h1>Members</h1>

	<ul>

	{% for user in users %}

	 <li>{{ user.username|e }}</li>

	{% endfor %}

	</ul>

 

Within a for-loop, it’s possible to cycle among a list of strings or variables each time through the loop by using the special cycle helper:

Jinja
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% for row in rows %}

	   <li class=""{% cycle('odd', 'even') %}"">{{ row }}</li>

	{% endfor %}

You can call variables that are defined outside of a loop from within a loop, but not the other way around.

If

In the simplest form, you can use it to test if a variable is defined, not empty, or not false:

Jinja
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% if UserAttribute.interests %}

	Your interests:

	<ul>

	{% for interest in UserAttribute.interests %}

	   <li>{{ interest|e }}</li>

	{% endfor %}

	</ul>

	{% endif %}

For multiple branches, elif and else can be used too:

Jinja
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% if UserAttribute.membership == 'Gold' %}

	You are a Gold member!

	{% elif UserAttribute.membership == 'Silver' %}

	You are a Silver member!

	{% else %}

	Please become a member today!

	{% endif %}

 

Working with Default Values

In the MoEngage email templates, when a message contains a null value, it will not be sent. Hence, we need to assign default fallback values to avoid such situations. In this example, if we don’t have the user’s location, this message would not be sent:   

Jinja
Welcome to {{UserAttribute['Location']}}

To ensure that messages are sent in such a situation, we need to provide a default fallback value that will be returned by the variable in case the value is null. MoEngage email template displays an overlay pop-up window that provides options to handle the situation where an attribute returns a null.

To ensure the message isn’t sent when an attribute value is missing, set the fallback value to Do not send if the variable is null. The MoEngage email template displays an overlay pop-up window with options for handling unsent messages.

The option selected by you will be automatically used while sending messages based on the value returned. If a default value is provided, then the personalized message looks like this:

Jinja
Welcome, {{UserAttribute['First name']|default('Guest')}}

Alternatively, we can also use

Jinja
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% set firstName = UserAttribute['First name'] %}

	 {% if firstName %}

	   Welcome, {{ firstName }}

	 {% else %}

	   Welcome!

	{% endif %}

If you don't want to send the message and if the value of the attribute is not found, you can use

Jinja
Welcome, {{UserAttribute['First name']|default('MOE_NOT_SEND')}}
Jinja Filters (Functions)

The following are a few of the global functions supported by Jinja:

String Filters
Convert to Proper Case/ Title Case

This will allow you to convert a string to Title case. For example:

Input: joHn doE

Output: John Doe

Jinja
{{UserAttribute['FirstName']|title}}

 

Capitalize First Letter

This will allow you to capitalize the first letter of each sentence in a string. For example:

Input: joHn doE. his age is 20.

Output: John doe. His age is 20. 

Jinja
{{UserAttribute['FirstName']|capitalize}}

 

Upper Case

This will allow you to convert a string to uppercase. For example:

Input: joHn doE

Output: JOHN DOE

Jinja
{{UserAttribute['FirstName']|upper}}

 

Lower Case

This will allow you to convert a string to lowercase. For example:

Input: JoHn doE

Output: john doe

Jinja
{{UserAttribute['FirstName']|lower}}

 

Replace a String

This will allow you to replace a part of a string with another string. For example, let's replace ""jo"" in joHn with ""ma"":

Input: joHn doE

Output: mahn doe

Jinja
{{UserAttribute['Mobile Number']|replace(“jo”,”ma”)}}

 

Check if a String Contains a Substring

This will allow you to check if a string contains a substring. For example:

Input String: Click on me now!

Input Substring: now

Output: true block

Jinja
{% if ""true"" in UserAttribute['eligible'] %}
true block
{% elif ""false"" in UserAttribute['eligible'] %}
false block
{% endif %}

 

Number Filters
Add +91

This will allow you to replace a part of add ""+91"" to a mobile number. For example:

Input: 9991119991

Output: +919991119991

Jinja
{{“+91” + UserAttribute['Mobile Number']|default('NA')}}

 

Consider 10 digits

This will allow you to consider only 10 digits of a mobile number. For example:

Input: +919991119991

Output: 9991119991

Jinja
{{UserAttribute['Mobile Number'][-10:]|default('NA')}}

 

Integer Filters
Bit Length of Data

Returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.

Jinja
int.bit_length()

 

Conjugate of the Complex Number

Returns the conjugate of the complex number. Complex numbers are not supported, so int.conjugate() returns the number itself.

Jinja
int.conjugate()

 

Float Filters
Identify whether the Float is a Finite Integer

Returns True if the float instance is finite with an integral value, and False otherwise.

Jinja
<span"">float.is_integer()</span"">

 

Hexadecimal String

Returns float represented by a hexadecimal string. The string may have leading and trailing whitespace.

Jinja
float.fromhex(string)

 

Conjugate of the Complex Number

Returns the conjugate of the complex number. Complex numbers are not supported, so float.conjugate() returns the number itself.

Jinja
float.conjugate()

 

List Filters
Occurrences of an Item

Returns the number of occurrences of the given item in the List.

Jinja
list.count(item)

 

Lowest Index in the List

Returns the lowest index in the List where the given item is found within the slice s[start:end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Similar to str.index().
list.index() throws an error if index not within the List.

Jinja
list.index(item[, start[, end]])

 

Remove Item at Index Position in the List

Returns the item at index position in List and also removes it from the List. If no index provided, returns and removes the last item in the list. list.pop() throws an error if index not within the List.

Jinja
list.pop([index])

Information

Auxiliary data is supported for all editors of MoEngage campaigns. This article uses the Email campaign as an example to explain how to personalize content using auxiliary data.

Example of Personalized Content with Auxiliary Data

Banks often send emails to their customers about credit card statements and the amount due for the billing cycle. With the Auxiliary Data feature, banks need not store sensitive customer information in MoEngage. They can import an auxiliary data file with the user name, ID, first name, last four digits of the credit card number, and the amount due and send campaigns to customers.

The following example shows the preview of a personalized email with auxiliary data the bank sent to a user:

Sample Import File

File Name: aux_data_cc_due_info_list

User_ID	First_Name	Last_Name	Last_4_Digits_of_CC	Amount_Due
JohnDoe	John	Doe	1234	4318
JaneDoe	Jane	Doe	5678	5617
Personalize Campaign Content Using Auxiliary Data

This section describes how you can personalize campaign content with this auxiliary data using the example of an Email campaign:

Import the auxiliary data file into MoEngage. For example, the name of the sample import file is aux_data_cc_due_info_list. For more information, refer to Importing Auxiliary Data.
After importing the file, create an Email campaign. For more information, refer to Create Email Campaign.
In Step 1, ""Target users,"" configure the campaign with the desired campaign name, control group, and target audience.
In Step 2, ""Content,"" click the Custom HTML editor tab and select a template.
In the Sender Details section, configure the Sender Name, Preview Text, From email address, Reply-to mail address, and Subject fields. Add CC and Bcc as desired.
Personalize the Subject and Sender Name fields if required.
In the Template editor box, add the campaign's content as required.
To add an attribute from the imported auxiliary data file, type @.
On the Email Personalization pop-up window, click the Aux Data tab.
In the Aux data list, click the required auxiliary data file. In this example, click the imported auxiliary data file aux_data_cc_due_info_list.
In the Lookup value list, search and select the unique user identifier that was mapped during the import. In this example, ID would be the unique identifier that maps to the User_ID field in the import file. 
In the Attribute list, click the auxiliary data attribute to be used for personalization. For example, to personalize the Amount Due for each user, select the Amount_Due attribute.
Click Done. The auxiliary data JINJA will get added to the field or the editor as shown below:

The following is a sample email content:
Dear {% set aux_data_cc_due_info_listData = UserAttribute['uid']|getAuxData('aux_data_cc_due_info_list') %}{{aux_data_cc_due_info_listData.First_Name|default('User')}},

Your credit card statement for the card number ending with {% set aux_data_cc_due_info_listData = UserAttribute['uid']|getAuxData('aux_data_cc_due_info_list') %}{{aux_data_cc_due_info_listData.Last_4_Digits_of_CC}} is here.

Amount Due: {% set aux_data_cc_due_info_listData = UserAttribute['uid']|getAuxData('aux_data_cc_due_info_list') %}{{aux_data_cc_due_info_listData.Amount_Due}}

View or download the attachment for the detailed statement.
If you want to check how your personalized message looks for a specific user, you can preview it.

Common Personalization Errors and FAQs

Personalization failure occurs when you use a user attribute or event attribute that is not present in the MoEngage dataset and do not configure a fallback.

Personalization Errors

You can see personalization errors in the Failed to Send error category in the Error breakdown table. Click See breakdown in the Name column for personalization errors to get a detailed view of the number of users for whom personalization has failed and the reasons for failure.





Personalization Failure Analysis

The Personalization failure analysis helps you identify specific attributes that cause personalization failures and offers in-depth insights into these causes. 
Personalization errors can be classified into the following categories:

Error Category	Description


User Attribute

	This denotes the unavailability of the user attribute used in personalization because it is unavailable in the system (for example, copy-paste errors) or for a specific user. For example, if the first_name user attribute is used in personalization and unavailable for a user, this will result in a User Attribute error.


Event Attribute

	This denotes the unavailability of the user attribute used in personalization because it is unavailable in the system (for example, copy-paste errors) or for a specific user. For example, if the product_name event attribute is used in personalization and unavailable for a user, this will result in an Event Attribute error.


Campaign Attribute

	This denotes an unavailability of campaign-specific information used in personalization. For example, if campaign tags are used for personalization and a campaign tag attribute is missing, this will result in a Campaign Attribute error.


Undefined

	

This denotes errors that happen when MoEngage cannot fetch the value for the attribute used in personalization. For example, if the image attribute is unavailable for a specific product in a product set, this will result in an Undefined error.




Unknown

	This denotes any error that does not fall into the abovementioned categories.

 

info	

Information

The number of failures listed in the Personalization Failed category under Failed to Send denotes the unique number of users for whom personalization has failed. In some cases, this might differ from the count shown in the Personalization failure analysis pop-up window, as multiple failures can happen for the same user and might be counted under each failure category shown in the UI. For example, if a user were to have a user attribute and event attribute failure, they would be counted for the number of failures in both these sections in the analysis page. In contrast, they would be counted as one in the Personalization Failed section.

Personalization Failure

Consider a scenario where you have personalized both the template and backup notifications but not added the personalization fallback. In this situation, if the personalization fails for the template or backup, the notification will not be sent to any users. This is because the template and backup are considered to be part of one payload. Because the personalization fallback does not exist, MoEngage won't have any alternate message to send to the user in case of failure. 

To avoid this issue, make sure that you add a personalization backup to your messages.

Internal Errors

MoEngage internal system generates a few errors, which apply to Push messages sent to all platforms.

Error	Description
Personalization Failed	This occurs when Push Personalization fails, and you have not configured a fallback message. MoEngage will not notify the user and will generate the Personalization Failed error."

Push Notification Center Overview
Overview

The Push Notification Center  feature provides users with a history of received push notifications. This ensures important messages aren't missed and remain accessible for later review, enhancing user engagement.

MoEngage provides two distinct approaches to implementing a Push Notification Center:

MoEngage Push Notification Center: This is a ready-to-use option with extensive UI customization capabilities.
Self-Handled Push Notification Center: This is a fully customizable Self-Handled Push Notification Center.
MoEngage Push Notification Center	Self-Handled Push Notification Center
	

A built-in inbox inside the application that displays push notification history with basic UI customization options.
Managed and rendered by the MoEngage SDK.
For example, in the MoEngage push notification center, MoEngage provides the look and feel of the inbox where users view past notifications, though you can customize some elements.
	
A custom inbox developed by your app team using MoEngage SDK notification payloads. In this case, MoEngage provides the notification content (for example, the text of the message), and your developers design and build the UI.
Your developers design and build the UI based on your app’s design guidelines.
For example, in the Self-Handled Push Notification Center, you have full control over the design of this inbox; you populate it with data from MoEngage.

Regardless of the preferred implementation method, the push notification center serves as a valuable tool for improving user engagement, providing message persistence, and enhancing the overall user experience within your application.

Benefits
Persistent content: Users can interact with push notifications inside the app, even after they are dismissed from the notification drawer.
Interaction data: Interaction done within the notification center can be tracked on the MoEngage dashboard.
Non-intrusive: Notification center content appears as a native part of the user's app experience and is non-disruptive. This increases user receptivity, resulting in better engagement.
Use Cases
Offers and Promotions
Gamification and enrolment in contests
Reminders and tips
Changes to policies and terms and conditions

Campaigns and Channels 
Mobile Push 
Getting Started with Mobile Push
Android Push Permission and Reachability
Overview - Push Permission

Push notifications permission is an app-level permission that your app gets on a user's device. This permission is required to display push notifications on users' notification trays. If this permission is turned off, the notifications that you send will not be visible to the user; they will get delivered in the background to your app silently. 

How Does Push Permission Work?

While apps are automatically granted permission to send notifications for Android 12 and lower versions, Android 13 and higher OS versions require the apps to request permission from users before sending notifications.

Android 12 or lower OS version devices: Apps are automatically granted permission to send notifications. This means that users do not have to give explicit permission for apps to send them notifications, and they are, by default, opted-in.
Android 13 or higher OS version devices - Push notification permission is a new feature in Android 13 that requires apps to request permission from users before they can send notifications. When a user installs an app on a device with Android 13 or higher, the app will not be able to send notifications until the user grants permission.


Android has introduced runtime permission for users to grant the push permission

If the user grants permission, the app will be able to send notifications to the user.
If the user denies or ignores the permission, the app will not be able to send notifications to the user.

The image illustrates how Push permissions are requested from users by an app (Trip Planner).

 

Users can still go to the app's notification settings and change the permission, similar to the older Android versions. 

	

Here's how Push permissions work on various Android versions:

Apps targeting Android 13 or higher
Apps targeting Android 12 (compatibility mode)

Apps that target Android 13 or higher have higher control over how this grant works.

Here's how push notification permission works in Android 13 compatibility mode:

Apps can control when and where the prompt to grant permission is displayed to a user.
If the user grants permission, the app will be able to send notifications to the user.
If the user denies or ignores permission, the app will not be able to send notifications to the user.
If the user explicitly denies permission twice, the app will not be able to prompt the user again unless the user reinstalls the app

This permission is reset on every reinstall and clear data. This permission is retained on OS upgrades with one exception. When the user upgrades the device from Android 12 to Android 13:

If the app did not have permission in Android 12 then after upgrading to Android 13 the app will not be able to send notifications until the user grants permission.
If the app had permission in Android 12 then after upgrading to Android 13 the app will be able to send notifications via a temporary grant which remains till the user opens the app for the first time after the upgrade. After the user opens the app, the permission resets, and the app will not be able to send notifications until the user grants permission.
Tracking Push Permissions

To enable Android to push notification Opt-in/Opt-out tracking, upgrade to MoEngage Core SDK version 12.3.01 and above. MoEngage SDK tracks the device's opt-in status by default. The opt-in status of the user’s devices will be can be tracked by the “Reachability Push Android” user attribute.

Tracking Push Permission Status at a User Level
Reachability Push Android attribute value	Reachability Description
202 - Not reachable due to Opt-out	

This is the reachability value for any user who has opted out of receiving push notifications on all of their Android devices eligible for Push.

These users are no longer considered reachable and will not be targeted for campaigns. 


201 - Reachable and opted in	This is the reachability value for any user who has opted in to receive push notifications on at least one of their Android devices.
200 - Reachable and opt-in status unknown	

This is the reachability value for users whose opt-in/opt-out preferences are not being tracked because these users are on the older SDK version. These users will be considered reachable and will be attempted for sending push notifications, but some of these users may be opted-out and will not be able to see notifications.

Opt-in/opt-out tracking is supported on MoEngage Core SDK version 12.3.01 and above.

Tracking Changes in Push Permission at a User Level

The following are the events for Android Push permission changes:

Name	Description	Platform
Subscribed to Push	Tracked when a user subscribes to Push Notifications.	Android
Unsubscribed to Push	

Tracked when a user changes push permission for a device from Subscribed to Unsubscribed

Note: This event will not be generated for devices where the permission is denied by default.

	Android

 

info	

Information

These events will be generated only when the Opt-in status of a device changes or a user explicitly confirms the permission. The default state of a device will not trigger a Subscribed/unsubscribed to push event.

Example - For Android 12 and below devices, the device is opted-in by default. This will not trigger a Subscribed to push event. For Android 13, the user is opted out by default and it will not trigger an Unsubscribed to push event. However, if you request push permission to the user via the native prompt and the user blocks permission, you will get an Unsubscribed to push event.

Tracking Push Permission Trends Over Time

The Reachability Dashboard at MoEngage shows you the reachability trends of all users who opted in to receive your Push notifications and those who have not. You can access the Reachability Dashboard by navigating to Dashboards > Reachability.

For more information, refer to Push Reachability Dashboard.

Tracking Opt-In Rate of Android 13 Users

Since the users have multiple devices, data for a specific OS version is not available.

The steps to track the Opt-in rate for users who are active on your app in the last 60 days are described belowd.

Navigate to Analytics -> Behavior on the MoEngage Dashboard.
In the Events & filters section, select users who did an App/Site Opened event and whose OS version is 33.
In the Filter Users section, select the Filter users by option.
Select the filter condition for the User property Reachability Push Android as in the following [201-Reachable and opted in, 202- Reachable but opted out].
In the Behavior Options, choose the Analysis type as Unique users, Compare by as Reachability Push Android, and the Duration as last 2 months.
Select the Pie Chart visualization in the Behavior Chart section. A sample image for the filter conditions chosen is shown below. The percentage of users with 201 as the ratio should give you the Opt-in rate for Android 13 users only. You can modify the query to get the opt-in rates for users on other OS versions.

Improving Opt-In Rates

We highly recommend that you target Android 13 or higher as soon as possible to benefit from the additional control and flexibility of this feature. If you continue to target 12L (API level 32) or lower, you lose some flexibility with requesting permission in the context of your app's functionality.

Opt-In Methods

The following are the various methods to obtain opt-ins from users:

Two Step Opt-in
One Step Opt-in
Self Handled Opt-in

A double opt-in or a two-step opt-in involves asking the user's permission in two steps. You set the context first in the first step and then take the user to the notification settings to enable push notifications from your app. The prerequisites and campaign setup for the two-step opt-in are discussed below.

Prerequisite for two-step opt-in

Integrate In-app notifications in Moengage SDK 12.6.00 and above and InApp version 6.5.0 or above, refer to the release notes for compatible version of the core SDK.

Pre-permission messages

Using In-app notifications, you can create pre-permission messages that can give the context to the user on why they should allow Push notifications for your app. Since you cannot trigger the Android native push prompt if the user explicitly denies permission twice, this method also helps you avoid showing the Android native push prompt unnecessarily, and you can reach out to the user again.

Campaign setup for showing the two-step opt-in prompt
Actions
Request notification permission
If the user is eligible, this action triggers the Android native notification permission. If the user is not eligible because they have already declined the prompt multiple times or are on a lower OS version, they will be redirected to the application notification settings screen where the user can manage notification permission
Navigate to Notification Settings
This action takes the user to the application notification settings screen, where the user can manage notification permission
Segmentation

Unless there is a specific use case to filter out a segment of users, we recommend using “All users” as the segmentation condition. Moegnage automatically manages the following cases:

Irrelevant users
For In-app notifications that contain any of the above actions, Moengage will automatically filter out irrelevant users e.g.

Users who are already opted-in
Users who are on older SDK version where Opt-in permissions actions is not supported
Android 12 or lower users
These actions automatically select the right behavior for opted-out users based on the OS version. Android 12 or lower users would be taken to the application notification settings screen, where the user can manage notification permission
Priority

Campaigns with the above actions are automatically set to Critical-functional priority, which prioritizes them over other campaigns with the same trigger condition

Minimum delay

You can choose to add a minimum delay to nudge the users every few days instead of asking them for permission in every session

Recommended Strategies

You can employ any of the methods mentioned below to request permission to send Push notifications to users. Here are a few recommended strategies that you can implement to get the optimal number of users for Push notifications.

Aggressive
 
Balanced
Conservative
 
Use Case Only
Target audience	

Apps that rely heavily on Push notifications as an engagement channel.


Implementation	

Use the following implementation:

First permission method: Refers to the opt-in or permission request that is sent to users the very first time they log in. Depending on the strategy you choose, the way you seek the first permission may differ.
Use a self-handled opt-in method to trigger notifications requesting push permission directly on every app open. In this approach, the notification prompt is displayed until the user clicks Don’t allow twice.
Follow-up method: Follow-up in-app notifications are sent as a nudge to encourage users to grant push permission or opt-in to receive push notifications from the app. To use this method, you must space out a two-step opt-in campaign regularly with a few days delay between campaigns. You can set up the campaign by adding the push notification to a navigable screen. After the user clicks the notification, you can trigger a single-step opt-in push notification. The follow-up campaign should follow these conditions:
Segmentation: All users
Trigger: Homepage screen
Minimum delay between 2 campaigns: 10 days
Use case-based: This is a trigger-based two-step opt-in campaign. For example, you could set up an in-app campaign that is triggered on certain events such as the “Checkout complete” event, Thank-you screen, Upcoming events screen, and “Subscribed to program”. You can select the event trigger based on the event of your choice and add the segmentation criteria as All users.

For more details, refer to Implementation Details.


Insights from early data	

We observed that this gives the highest opt-in rate for some apps. However, this has a tendency to annoy users leading to uninstalls, and follow-up campaigns have poor performance because the user must go to settings to give push permission."

iOS Push Permission and Reachability
Overview

iOS push permission is a system that allows an app to send notifications to a user's device, even when the app is not actively being used. To enable push notifications, the user must grant permission to the app to send them notifications.
Provisional push is a feature introduced in iOS 12 that allows apps to send notifications to users without explicitly asking for permission upfront. Instead, the app can send ""quiet"" notifications that appear in the Notification Center but do not show up on the lock screen or make a sound. The idea behind provisional push is to let users experience the value of push notifications before deciding whether to grant full push permission.

How Push Permissions Work in iOS

The following diagram depicts how push permissions work in iOS based on the user response.

By default, any app does not have permission to send push notifications.

For Provisional Push Permission

The app automatically grants permission to send provisional push notifications when provisional permission is requested.
When a notification is displayed with provisional permission, the user can either keep or deny push permission. Note that campaign actions are not displayed on provisional push notifications.
MoEngage SDK tracks the outcome of provisional push only on the next app open.
When the user decides to keep the notification, permission is granted only to display it in the notification center. Displaying alerts, sounds, and badges is not granted; the user needs to grant permission to them separately by navigating to settings.
Provisional notification cannot be requested if the user has explicitly accepted or denied push permission.
For Explicit Push Permission

A user can grant push permission either through a push prompt or notification settings.
Apps can control when and where the push prompt is displayed to obtain permission from the user.
A push prompt can be displayed only once for an app on an iOS device.
If the user grants permission, the app can send notifications to the user.
If the user denies or ignores the permission, the app cannot send notifications to the user. After this, the user will not be prompted again unless the app is reinstalled.
The user can always go to the app's notification settings and change the permission.
The push prompt is displayed regardless of whether the provisional push permission is granted or not.
The push notification permission on iOS devices is reset on every reinstall and clear data. However, this permission is retained on operating system upgrades.
Track Push Permission
Track Push Permissions at a User Level

MoEngage SDK tracks the opt-in status of the user’s devices by default using the Reachability Push iOS user attribute. This attribute can have the following values:

Value	Description
200 - Reachable and opt-in status unknown	

This applies to all users who are:

Allowed to receive provisional push notifications
On older MoEngage SDK versions where push permission status is not tracked and has a valid push token.

To enable push notification opt-in or opt-out tracking on iOS, upgrade to the MoEngage Core SDK version after September 9, 2024.


201 - Reachable and opted in	

This applies to all the users who have opted in for push notifications through:

Clicking Allow on the push prompt
Clicking Keep on a provisional push notification
Turning on push permission via App notification settings

202 - Not reachable due to opt-out	

This applies to all users who have neither provisional nor explicit push permissions.

Track Push Permissions Trends Over Time

The Reachability Dashboard at MoEngage shows you the reachability trends of all users who opted in to receive your Push notifications and those who have not. You can access the Reachability Dashboard by navigating to Dashboards > Reachability.

For more information, refer to Push Reachability Dashboard.

Track Changes in Push Permission 

The following are the events for iOS Push reachability:

Value	Description	Platform
Subscribed to Push	

Tracked when a user explicitly subscribes to push notifications on a device.
This event is not triggered when a device is granted provisional push permission.

	

iOS


Unsubscribed to Push	

Tracked when a user directly unsubscribes from push notifications.

This event is only triggered when a user changes push permission from explicitly granted to explicitly denied via settings. This does not get triggered when the user denies push permission via a push permission prompt or via responding to a provisional push.

	

iOS

Track Opt-In Rates

Perform the following steps to track the opt-in rate for users who are active on your app:

Navigate to Analytics > Users on the MoEngage dashboard.
In the User property section, select the user property as Reachability Push iOS.
In the Filter Users section, select the Filter users by option.
Select the filter condition for the user property - Reachability Push iOS is equal to a Constant value such as 200 - Reachable and option status unknown, 201 - Reachable and opted in, or 202 - Reachable but opted out.
You can optionally select the filter condition to track opt-in rates for the last 60 days by selecting the App version. Note that this app version must have the SDK released after September 9, 2024.
In the User analysis options, select the Analysis type as Unique count, Split by as Reachability Push iOS, and click Apply.
In the Behavior Chart section, select the Pie Chart visualization. You can modify the query to get the opt-in rates for users.
Opt-In Methods
Request for Provisional Push

The request for this opt-in method triggers provisional push permission for the user without displaying any prompt. A push token is generated for this request. The user can either keep or deny the provisional push request. If explicit push permission is already granted or explicitly denied by the user, provisional push permission is not granted. For more details, refer to the provisional push permission part in the section above.

Request for Push Permission

The request for this opt-in method triggers the display of the iOS native push prompt to the user. A push token is generated for the same if not generated earlier. The push prompt is displayed to the user only once, and if permission is already granted or explicitly denied by the user, the prompt will not be displayed again. For more details, refer to the explicit push permission part of the above section.

Request Push Permission via Two-Step Opt-In with In-Apps

iOS Push permission uses the Two Step Opt-In method to obtain opt-ins from users:



A double or two-step opt-in involves asking the user's permission in two steps. In the first step, you set the context and then take the user to the notification settings to enable push notifications from your app. The prerequisite and campaign setup for the two-step opt-in method are discussed below.
Using in-app notifications, you can create pre-permission messages that explain to the user why they should allow push notifications for your app. Because you cannot trigger the iOS native push prompt if the user explicitly denies permission, they must go to the app's notification settings and change the permission.

Campaign Setup to Display the Two-Step Opt-In Prompt
Actions
Request notification permission
If the user is eligible, this action triggers the iOS native notification permission. If the user has already declined the prompt, they are directed to the application notification settings screen manually, where they can manage notification permission.
Navigate to notification settings
This action takes the user to the application notification settings screen, where the user can manage notification permission.
Segmentation

Unless there is a specific use case for filtering out a segment of users, it is recommended to use All users as the segmentation condition. For in-app notifications that contain any of the actions above, MoEngage automatically filters out irrelevant users who have already opted-in.

Priority

Campaigns with the actions above are automatically set to critical-functional priority, which prioritizes them over other campaigns with the same trigger condition.

Minimum Delay

You can choose to add a minimum delay to nudge the users every few days instead of asking them for permission in every session.

Using Provisional Push Permissions in Campaigns
info	

Information

This applies only to devices on the new SDK version released after September 9, 2024.

While creating Push campaigns, you can select options to filter out devices that have enabled provisional push under Target Platforms. Perform the following steps to access this option:

In the MoEngage dashboard, navigate to Create New.
Click Campaign > Push, and click the desired push campaign type.
Under Step 1 - Target users > Target Platforms, select iOS. You can see three options:
Send this campaign to all eligible devices - Use this option to maximise reach for the campaign. Users with provisional access may turn off push permission if the content is not important to them from this notifcation.
Exclude provisional push devices - Use this option if the campaign content is promotional and may turn off users with provisional push permission from opting in.
Send this campaign to only provisional push enabled devices - Use this option if the campaign is indented to nudge users into opting in for push notifcations. 

You can select any of the options above based on your specific needs to send the campaign.

After selecting the option above, you can proceed to the next steps of creating push campaigns. For more information, refer to Create Push Campaigns.


Recommended Best Practices

The following are some recommended best practices for setting up explicit and provisional push permissions.

For Explicit Push Permissions
Set up two-step permission in the first session and repeat requests every few days. Note that the iOS native permission prompt can be shown to the user only once.
Use the two-step opt-in method and avoid showing the permission prompt until the user is ready.
While requesting permission via two-step opt-in, the first session gives the maximum opt-in rates as the user is more receptive to accepting permissions in the first session. If the user is not ready, they will deny the two-step opt-ins and you will have opportunities later to request permission from the user.
Set up a minimum delay of a few days in your generic push notification campaigns to ensure that you request push permissions from your users at intervals. For example, maintain a minimum delay of 5 or 15 days to request the user for push permission.""
For Provisional Push Permissions
Request provisional push permission during the first session whenever the user installs that app. This ensures maximum reachability for first-time users. Note that provisional push notifications do not require explicit push permission from the user. However, provisional push notifications do not allow actions to be displayed; alerts, sound, and badges are not granted if permission is granted via provisional push.
To maximize opt-in rates using provisional push:
Use provisional push notifications to exclusively switch a user from provisional permission to explicit push permission and set up provisional exclusive campaigns to target users with engaging content.
Ensure to exclude provisional users from the promotional campaigns you have set up, specifically targeting only those users who have explicitly granted permission.
To maximize reach for a particular campaign:
Include provisional users if your goal is to reach maximum users. However, if the content is not very relevant to the user, they might discard the provisional permission, which inhibits your ability to interact with them through push notifications in the future."

Preference Management for Push Notifications
info	

Information

For Email Preference Management, under the GDPR compliance, by default, we do not send emails to Blocks, unsubscribed, and complaints.

Overview

Preference Management allows you to automatically exclude specific users from the campaigns.

Use cases for Preference Management
You do not want to send any campaigns (Event Triggered, Flows, General Campaigns) to the users who have opted out of Push notifications from a subscription page.
You want to automatically block all Push notifications for users when they have requested to block push notifications by invoking one of the rights under GDPR.
You want to blacklist a segment of users from all types of push notifications during certain situations like natural calamities in specific regions.

The default behavior of the campaigns would be to exclude the users selected in the preference management. However, you still have the flexibility to override these preferences while creating a campaign.

Setting Preferences

Navigate to Settings > Channels > Push > Preference Management.

Push Preferences

To enable preference management in the new UI, you must enable the Exclude users button. You can then proceed to define a criteria for the excluded users.

Add a filter for the users you want to exclude in the Criteria for excluded users section. You can see the count of these users by clicking on Show Count.
Click Save to save your configuration.
You can also click Reset to reset the preference management criteria.
Click Confirm to save your criteria.

Override preferences while creating a campaign

You can include the opted-out users while creating a campaign by overriding the preferences as shown below. This is generally used for sending transactional messages.

For Push Campaigns: 

On the campaign creation screen, select the option “Send campaign to the users excluded in preferences”.

For Push Notifications in Flows:
Go to Flows settings.
For Push, select “Send campaigns to the users excluded in Push preferences""."

Primary Device Per User
 	

Early Access

This is an Early Access feature. To enable it for your account, contact your CSM or raise a support ticket.

Overview

Marketers who send push notifications containing sensitive information want to ensure the intended recipient receives the notification on their latest active device. This is not a concern for Email, SMS, and WhatsApp notifications because they are sent to the email ID and mobile number, which are unique to individual users. Also, mobile numbers and email IDs are generally not shared among users. However, push notifications sent at a device level can create issues as devices can be shared among users, potentially exposing sensitive notifications.

The Primary Device Per User feature allows you to send push notifications only to the user's last active device, thereby maintaining privacy while receiving sensitive notifications. However, targeting a single or primary device per user retains all devices associated with a user without deleting them, but campaigns are sent exclusively to the last active device.

Detect the Primary Device

To detect the primary device, MoEngage maintains an additional flag for all devices at the user level. This flag marks the latest active device as the primary device.

When a user is associated with multiple devices, MoEngage tracks the event time using the SDK, which is when the user executes the event. Based on the latest event time captured by MoEngage, the device with the latest event time is marked as the primary device by setting a Primary flag. Note that only one device can have the primary flag, while the rest cannot.

For instance, user U1 has three devices: D1, D2, and D3. Based on the SDK request, if the event time of D2 is greater than the latest event time of the other devices, D2 is marked as the primary device for user U1.

info	

Information

This feature applies only to Push campaigns (also using Push API), Flows with the Push stage, and Inform alerts with the Push channel (also using Inform API).
MoEngage starts marking the user device as primary only after enabling this feature. Any historical events performed before enabling this feature are not used to detect the primary device.
After enabling the feature, it is recommended that you wait 30 days for all your monthly active users (MAU) to be detected with their primary devices.
Push notifications are sent only to the primary devices that have been detected because these notifications contain sensitive information. If the primary device is not detected for a user, notifications are not sent to them.
Send Campaigns to the Last Active Device

You can send campaigns to the last active device in the following ways:

Using the MoEngage dashboard
Using the APIs
Using the MoEngage Dashboard

The feature of targeting the last active device applies to the following campaign types within MoEngage:

Using the Inform API

The Inform API allows you to send push notifications specifically to a user's most recently active device. Note that this functionality is limited to triggering notifications for alerts that have been pre-configured within the MoEngage dashboard. You cannot use the Inform API to create or send new alerts that have not already been set up on the MoEngage dashboard.

For more information on Inform API, refer to Inform API.

Use Case 1: cURL Request Containing a Push-Token Parameter

The following cURL request contains a push token parameter and is sent to trigger push notifications for alerts that have been previously created. Push notifications are only delivered if the cURL request contains the push token of the last active device of the user.

For example, consider a scenario where a user has three devices: D1, D2, and D3, with D3 being the last active. When configuring the alerts in the MoEngage dashboard,you send the alert to the last active device. If the cURL request includes the push token parameter of the last active device (D3), the push notification is delivered to the user whose User ID is mentioned in the request. However, if the API request contains the push token for D1 or D2, the push notification is not delivered.

Use Case 2: cURL Request Without a Push-Token Parameter

The following cURL request does not contain a push token parameter and is sent to trigger push notifications for alerts that have been previously created. The push notifications are delivered to the last active device of the user.

For example, consider a scenario where a user has three devices: D1, D2, and D3, with D3 being the last active. When configuring the alerts in the MoEngage dashboard, you send the alert to the last active device (D3). As the cURL request does not contain any push token, the push notification is delivered to the last active device of the user whose User ID is mentioned in the request.

Information

The last active device is calculated only for mobile devices, which means Android and iOS platforms.
Push notifications are delivered to all web devices if a web platform is selected while creating alerts.
For example, consider a scenario where a user has three devices: D1 (web device), D2 (web device), and D3 (Android device), with D3 being the last active. When configuring alerts in the MoEngage dashboard, you choose Android and Web platforms and also choose to send the alert to the last active device (D3, Android device). In this case, the push notification is delivered to the last active device (D3) and also to both web devices (D1 and D2)."

Who does this shutdown affect?,https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/23072207451540-Discontinuation-of-Mi-Push-Service,"User Guide

Getting Started with Mobile Push
Discontinuation of Mi Push Service

Due to operational concerns, Xiaomi Corporation has recently notified users about discontinuing the Mi Push service beyond Mainland China. You might have already received correspondence regarding this matter.

Who does this shutdown affect?

The shutdown will only impact App Push Notifications sent via Push Amplification™ Plus to Xiaomi Devices.

What does the shutdown mean for you?

In the Push Amplification™ Plus, the Mi Push Native service was used as a push notification delivery rate amplification technique over and above Firebase Cloud Messaging(FCM). Now that the Mi Push service is being shut down, we cannot provide the Mi Push service for Xiaomi devices. However, our Push Amplification™ Plus will still work perfectly to deliver notifications to Xiaomi devices.

What will be the impact?

Rest assured that your Xiaomi devices will continue to receive the notifications you send. For Xiaomi devices, the Mi Push Native service offered marginally better delivery rates over Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Hence, we foresee that some of our customers with a substantial base of Xiaomi devices using Push Amplification™ Plus will see a slight decrease in their Push Notification delivery rates.

When will MoEngage apply these changes?

To ensure we switch to a stable service and prepare our customers for upcoming changes, we will continue to run the Mi Push service for Xiaomi devices until March 30th, 2024. From March 31st, 2024, Xiaomi devices will be targeted via FCM service instead.

Other changes that MoEngage would be making regarding Mi Push deprecation

From Android SDK version 13.00.00 onwards, MoEngage will stop supporting Mi Push.
On the MoEngage Dashboard, you will stop seeing the Mi Push Settings section illustrated in the following image:
Recommended Action

We recommend that our customers remove Mi Push SDK from their apps. The steps to do so are enumerated in Removing Mi SDK Dependency.

FAQs
What will happen if I don’t remove Mi SDK by or after the deprecation date? Will I face app crashes if I do not remove Mi SDK?


If your app has Mi SDK integrated along with MoEngage SDK, it will not lead to app crashes even after Mi Push service is discontinued on April 2, 2024.
The Mi SDK will continue to be integrated as a Dead SDK, which may execute but will not impact any feature. The push token registration for FCM will continue to function, and such devices will be targetable via regular Push.




However, we recommend removing the Mi SDK with your next app release. The steps to do so are enumerated in Removing Mi SDK Dependency. Support for Mi Push will also be removed from MoEngage Android SDK version 13.00.00 onwards.

Will Xiaomi devices no longer be targeted via push notifications?


After April 2, 2024, Xiaomi devices will continue to receive the notifications you send via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).




For Xiaomi devices, the Mi Push Native service offered marginally better delivery rates over Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Hence, we foresee that some of our customers with a substantial base of Xiaomi devices using Push Amplification™ Plus will see a slight decrease in their Push Notification delivery rates.

Should I continue using Push Amplification™ and Push Amplification™ Plus for my campaigns?


Yes. Push Amplification™ will continue to operate for all Android users and Push Amplification™ Plus will continue to operate for the non-Xiaomi eligible devices. You will still be able to see the uplift from these services in your campaigns.
We foresee that some of our customers with a substantial base of Xiaomi devices using Push Amplification™ Plus will see a slight decrease in their Push Notification delivery rates."

For more information, refer to Pre-Compute Segments and send Push at the right time.

Conversion Goals

You can add conversion goals to track the business metrics for your campaigns. You can track up to five conversion goals. You can choose any app event as a conversion goal activity and set more than one conversion goal. The first goal will be treated as a primary goal.

For example, if you want to track the number of customers who've purchased an iPhone after your campaign was sent. (Event - purchase event, Product - iPhone). Your conversion goal set-up might look similar to the image shown below with the following details:

Goal Name - iPhonePurchase 
App Event you wish to track- Made Purchase
Event Attribute/Property - product is event attribute/property 
Value of Event Attribute/Property - iPhone

With multiple conversion goals, you can track more than one business metric or visualize a funnel for your user actions. For example, if you want to check the following, you can do so with multiple conversion goals.

How many users have viewed the product page?
How many of them added that product to the cart?
How many of them made a successful order?

Ignore global minimum delay - Enable this toggle to ignore the settings for the minimum delay set for Push notifications.
Throttle -Set the throttling for Push notifications. For more information, refer to Push Throttling.


info	

Information

 

With the reduction in the default FCM API rate limits to 600,000 RPM, we are changing the maximum allowed throttle speed for Push notifications to 500,000 RPM to ensure a single campaign does not breach the project limit. This change will apply to new and existing campaigns. You may still see drops because of multiple campaigns being triggered together. For more information, refer to Changes in Sending Speed with Private Key Configuration.

Advanced Settings

The following options are available in this section:

Expiration Settings - let you specify an expiry value for the push notification. This section contains information about when to stop sending push notifications (after a specific time duration mentioned) for the iOS and Android platforms. 

	

To set the push expiry value, the following options are available here:

Expire notifications after - This field specifies how long push notification services store a message for delivery before discarding it if undelivered. Push services (FCM/APNS) retry sending the message until the Expire notifications after duration (in minutes) expires. After this period, delivery attempts stop. The default value is 36 hours and applies to Android and APNS push notifications.
Remove notifications from inbox after - If you use the Notification Center (Inbox) feature of the MoEngage SDK, you can specify the duration after which the notification should be removed from the Inbox. The duration can be set in days or hours. By default, the value will be set to 30 days.
info	

Note

 

MoEngage sends the configured Expire Notifications After value to the respective delivery partner (such as FCM, APNS, or Web Push services). However, these services may not honor this value in all cases. In some campaigns, FCM has delivered notifications beyond the expiry time for approximately 0.1%–0.5% of users, and APNS for up to 0.1%.

Priority - choose this option for time-critical notifications. The following options are available:

Android:
Send at priority: Specifies whether the notification should be sent with high priority.
Selected: Delivers the notification immediately, bypassing device restrictions such as battery optimizations or low-power modes.
Cleared: Delivers the notification in a way that conserves device resources, such as when the device is idle or in low-power mode.

This checkbox ensures urgent notifications reach users promptly while non-urgent ones adhere to power-saving policies.

iOS:
APNS Priority: Specifies the priority of a notification's delivery, informing APNS how to handle delivery under network or power constraints.
A value of `10` delivers the notification immediately and wakes the device if necessary.
A value of `5` delivers the notification in a way that conserves device power, such as when the device is idle or in low-power mode.
A value of '1' delivers the notification, prioritizing power conservation over all other factors without waking the device.
Interruption Level: You can specify the importance and timing of the notification, helping to manage interruptions for the user. For more information, see Notifications in iOS 15.
Relevance Score: You can specify a value between 0 and 1 that indicates the importance of the notification in the notification center. For more information, refer to Notifications in iOS 15.
	

 

info	

Information

APNS stores only one notification per bundle ID and selects it non-deterministically when multiple notifications are sent to the same bundle ID. Note that the delivery depends on the APNS and is not controlled by MoEngage. In case of multiple undelivered notifications, typically, the notification with the highest priority gets delivered when the device returns online. For more information, see APNS documentation. 

While you have the option to set your notification priorities based on your requirements, we recommend keeping the value at '10' (default) to ensure immediate delivery, unless there is a specific strategic need to prioritize the delivery of certain categories of notifications differently. For instance, if there is a need to deliver transactional notifications and it is observed that promotional notifications are hampering the delivery of transactional notifications, the marketer may choose to reduce the priority of the promotional campaigns to improve the chances of transactional notifications getting delivered.

Last Active device - Select the Last Active device checkbox to send this push campaign only to the latest active device of the target user. For more information, refer to Primary Device Per User. 

	
 	

Early Access

The Last Active device is an Early Access feature. To enable it for your account, contact your CSM or raise a support ticket.

Your campaign is now ready to be sent. To create the campaign, click Publish and confirm in the dialog box that opens.

The Campaign Info page will be displayed once the campaign has been created successfully.

Pause Campaign 
Event-Triggered

Click Pause at the top right corner of the campaign details page. 

This pauses an active event-triggered campaign. Qualified users to receive the campaign at the trigger event(s) will not be sent any message during the pause. Qualified users before the campaign was paused will be sent the message.

Queued Triggers

You may want to queue the triggers that qualify to receive the campaign during the period the campaign is paused.  You should enable this option for the queuing to begin.

Any queued trigger stays that way for a maximum of the Queuing period,  which is configurable for each client and applies to all types of start trigger queuing.

info	

Information

The queuing period can be a maximum of 24 hours.

Resume Campaign 

While resuming a paused campaign with the triggers queued, you may choose to: 

process those triggers in the queue at the time of resuming the flow
purge the queue and resume the campaign for new triggers. 

Process the queued triggers and send them the campaign 
When selected, the queued triggers will be sent the latest message(if edited)using First In, First Out.
The campaign, when resumed, will adhere to the configured DND settings, and the campaign will be sent out at the next available non-DND hour for the queued triggers. 
To identify the delay in sending the campaign from the expected time as per the campaign schedule, we have added the ""was queued"" attribute to the Campaign Sent event to reflect that the delay in sending was due to the trigger being queued as the campaign was paused.


Discard the queue and purge the triggers that are currently in the queue as per the queuing period 
When selected, the queued triggers are not processed and will be purged. The campaign will start processing the new triggers that qualify after resuming the campaign. 
To identify these purged triggers that will not be receiving the campaign, the ""Trigger Purged"" event will be added to the user profile of all such users whose triggers are purged.  

The Trigger purged event is also raised when the queuing period ends for queued triggers and is removed from the queue. Such triggers will not be sent to the campaign upon resuming the campaign. 

check_circle	

Takeaway

Trigger Purged event is generated when the notification is finally not sent to the user. It can happen in 2 cases:
(a)  after the paused campaign is resumed with the option to purge the queued triggers 
(b) the trigger has been in the queued state for more than the queuing period (max 24 hours), and the campaign has yet to be resumed.

Note

Marketers cannot edit segmentation filters/types, IF/AND events and trigger delay options, add/remove variations, send type, conversion goal, and attribution window.

Send Exit Intent Notification Using Device Triggers

As a marketer, you can create exit intent notifications, such as sending a notification to users as soon as they exit the app. The goal of such notifications is to bring back users as soon as they abandon your app. These exit notifications are sent using device triggers. We recommend reading about device triggers and how they work as a first step before delving into exit intent notifications.

You can serve messages even when devices are offline. This makes a good case for Fitness or Gaming apps. In this example, you will create an Exit Intent notification for All users available on the Android platform. Perform the following steps:

Step 1: Target Users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Outbound, select Push and then the required delivery type. You are taken to the first step ""Target users"" of defining your campaign.
Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage.
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign.
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.
In the Trigger Criteria section, set up MOE_APP_EXIT as the trigger event.
In the IF user section, select Has Executed as MOE_APP_EXIT.
In the THEN trigger the message section, define the With Delay option and define the delay as shown the following image:

In the Target Audience section, select All users.
In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step ""Content"" where you can define the content that will go into your Push campaign.
Step 2: Content
Select the template that you like to go with. For our example, select Basic notification.

Enter the required content for the campaign for the targeted platform Android.

Click Next to move to the third step ""Schedule and goals"" where you can define the schedule and goal of your campaign.
Step 3: Schedule and Goals
Define when to start and end this campaign and the conversion goal based on your requirements.
In Delivery controls, ensure that you check the Send message in offline mode if you wish to serve the Exit Intent notifications even when your users are offline.

Notification Features and Behavior
Notification Actions
Overview

Notification Action Buttons enable your Push Notification to have up to three Call To Actions (CTA) - one for the default notification clicks and two for the notification actions.

Marketers can drive users to take specific actions without opening the app and make immediate decisions. The image below is a snapshot of the Android Message preview configured with Share and Call Actions, where marketers can drive their customers to take these two actions directly from the notification panel.

To use these actions, you need to check two things:

Your Notification display is being handled by MoEngage SDK.
Your app is using a suitable SDK version. If not, upgrade that to the latest SDK version.

Support for Notification actions is as described:

Platform	OS Support	SDK Support	Remarks
Android	Android 4.1 (API 16) and above	SDK Version 6.0.02 and above. Snooze & Remind Later buttons got improved in 6.0.25	Check about our latest SDK
iOS**	iOS 8 and above	SDK Version 2.2 and above	Check about our latest SDK

Track an event	To track an event generated on Click Action	Event to be tracked
Set attribute	To set any user attribute on basis of a user action	Attribute Key-Value
Custom Native Actions	To do app functions directly from the notification	Raw text to be passed to Client App
How to use the Actions

Go to Step 2: Messaging, and after configuring your message, click on Actions Tab.
 


In Android, you will see:

Default Action: This is the default action of your notification. You can decide where you would want to take your user by clicking this notification.

Action Button 1: You can configure your button name, and the action that you want to be done using this button

Action Button 2: You can configure your button name, and the action that you want to be done using this button.

You can perform these actions with our Notification Actions:

1) Call (for Android only): You can let your user directly call customer care, seller, restaurant, driver anyone directly from the notification.

2) Copy (for Android only): You can allow your customer to copy the intended text with this action. Once the user clicks on Copy, the text will be copied to her clipboard. Can be used to send OTPs, Coupon Codes, and so on.

3) Share (for Android only): You can allow your customer to share the intended text with this action. Once the user clicks on Share, the share dialogue will open allowing the user to share the message on various platforms.

4)Snooze  (for Android only): You can allow your customer to snooze the notification for a certain number of hours. Configuration value of 5 hours will allow the customer to snooze his notification for 5 hours from the click on the Snooze button.

5)Remind Later(for Android only): You can allow your customer to remind him/her of that notification as per the choice made by him. Here you can configure two reminder instances:

Remind Today in X hours - Sets reminder for X hours from the time of click for the same day. e.g. If the time of click is 2:00 pm, Remind today in 4 hours will set a reminder at 6:00 pm the same day.
Remind Tomorrow at X hours - Set reminder for next day to day of click at time X hours. For example, if the time of click is 2:00 pm, Remind tomorrow at 4 hours will set a reminder at 10:00 am for the next day. 

6) Track Event (for Android only): To track an event generated on Click Action. The user should put the name with which he/she wants to track the event as well as its Attribute value.

7) Set Attribute (for Android only): You can use this to set any user attribute on basis of user action. Just choose the existing attribute from the User Attribute dropdown or create a new one and configure the value that you want to set on the button click.

8) Custom Action (for Android only): Helps perform the app functions like Add to Cart or Play a song etc. directly from the notification. Check here on how to integrate them into your apps.

* Action Button Icons:

Action Button icons are not supported since Android Nougat. For versions prior to Android Nougat, you can add the required icons in appropriate shape and size in your app bundle so that you can then use those custom icons for notification buttons. You can maintain uniformity with Custom Icons as they will just be dependent on App Version.
 
You can use icons from your own app bundle or other system icons. Just ensure that they are present in your drawable folder. If the entered name is wrong or the icon is not found, the icon won't be shown.  
info	

Note for iOS

Regarding the supported actions, the app developer has to himself define the categories (and corresponding actions) in the app itself and provide the list of categories to SDK. Our SDK will use the categories supported across the app versions to reference those categories and map actions. They are not configurable on the go by the marketer but are to be developed and released by the app developers. Check out more about it here.

Click Performance for Notification Actions

Once you have created and sent your campaign, you can also track the click performance of these notification actions.

Go to the All campaigns page and click the campaign created by you.
On the analytics page, select the platform and you can see the platform-wise click performance of your notification actions.

You should be able to see Click Performance as in the below sample snapshot. It reports the total number of clicks against every action along with the click share of each action, which is the percentage of clicks on specific action with respect to total clicks.

Notification Features and Behavior
Pre-Compute Segments and send Push at the right time

Pre-Computing the segments allows you to send highly time-sensitive campaigns at the right time. It ensures that segmentation is done in advance so that you can send campaigns immediately at the scheduled time.

It is highly useful when you have to send a broadcast/multicast, say for a Flash Sale, which starts at 2:00 pm, and you want users to start receiving messages at 2:00 pm itself without spending even a few seconds on segmentation.

info	

Note

99.9 percent of queries at MoEngage get executed within 30 seconds.
This feature is handy when your segment is complex (outliers of your creative genius) or you want to send out your campaigns immediately at the scheduled time, without even few seconds of delay.
Enabling Pre-Compute

On the Scheduling page (Step 3) of campaign creation, select the check box Compute target audience in advance to ensure that campaigns are sent faster and at the right time. This is beneficial for cases when you are using a complex segmentation query that usually takes some time to run. 

How does it work?

Generally, while running a campaign, segmentation starts at the campaign's scheduled time and fetches users from the segmentation at the time of sending the campaign so that no potential customer is missed.

But in cases where the timing of the message is of greater essence, and marketers don't want campaigns to be delayed by even a few minutes taken to calculate segments, pre-compute helps ensure timely delivery.

Pre-Compute solves this problem by running the segmentation query in advance anytime between 30 mins to 2 hours. Hence, at the campaign send time, the target users are already available, and campaign sending starts right away at the scheduled time without any delays.

 

info	

Information

Using Precompute in a campaign comes with a trade-off that some users may be excluded from the campaign. When segmentation is performed before the campaign start time (e.g., 30 minutes prior), any users meeting the criteria after the precomputation but before the campaign launch are not included in the campaign.


For Example, if a campaign targeting users who performed an ""Add to Cart"" action in the last 24 hours is scheduled to go live at 5:00 PM, segmentation precomputed at 4:30 PM excludes users who perform the action between 4:30 PM and 5:00 PM.

So, it involves the trade-off between the timely delivery of a campaign vs capturing all the intended users.

 

Editing a campaign when pre-compute is ON

If the segmentation query of the campaign was edited 30 mins prior to the campaign sending time, then the list of users computed in advance will be dropped, and the target users will be fetched at the campaign sending time. In this case, the pre-computed segment will not be honored, and the campaign will be sent in the usual flow."

Notifications in iOS 15

Apple has announced new updates for Push notifications aimed at helping users stay focused and avoid unnecessary interruptions. For more details on all the changes concerning iOS 15, MoEngage Blog on iOS 15 Push Notifications. We've discussed the changes in the sections below.

New Focus mode and an Interruptions API

Focus is a new feature that filters notifications and apps based on what the user wants to focus on. To reduce distractions, users can set a custom Focus or a suggested Focus like Work or Sleep.

How does it affect you?

The notification framework has a new interruptions API that allows marketers to define how and when to deliver the notifications. Four interruption levels are defined as follows:

Interruption Level	Description	Use case	Break-through focus mode
Passive	Delivered Quietly will directly appear on the Device Notification Center.	Non-urgent notifications like product recommendations or new feature updates	NO
Active	Default Behaviour, depending on the focus mode or notification-summary setting, the notification may or may not be delivered quietly.	News updates or weather forecast	NO
Time Sensitive	Can break through the focus-mode / notification-summary setting and will be delivered prominently with sound.	

Banking transaction updates or an e-commerce order delivery update 

 

	YES
Critical	It is similar to Time Sensitive, but the notification will have a sound even when the phone is in silent mode.	Extremely important alerts like a storm warning	YES

Critical alerts (which can also break through silent mode and Do Not Disturb) require a special entitlement that you must obtain from Apple, and they are meant for very important notifications such as health alerts or security alarms.

What MoEngage is doing about it?

You can set the notification interruption level in the Advanced tab of Step 3 while creating the campaign.

Use the Time-Sensitive option cautiously because the first time a user receives a Time-Sensitive notification, the system will prompt them to keep or turn off future Time-Sensitive notifications from that brand. So if you are not sure, use Active or Passive notifications.

SDK update is not required to use this feature. However, you need to add the Time Sensitive Notifications capability in the app Xcode.

New Notification Summary

Notifications from a certain app can be delivered as a summary at a pre-set time in the day. This is to reduce the interruptions from active notifications during the day. Apple also introduced a ‘Relevance’ API that assigns a score between 0 and 1 to the notifications, so they can be presented in that respective order in the summary.

Within the notification summary, iOS 15.0 contains on-device intelligence to order the summary as per the user’s interactions with the apps. More frequently used apps will be provided higher priority.

What MoEngage is doing about it?

You can set the Relevance Score of a notification by entering any value between 0 to 1 in the Advanced tab. The relevance score for the most important message should be 1, whereas the least important message should be 0. For a notification with medium importance, you can set it as 0.5.

If you send multiple push notifications in a day, the notification with the highest relevance score will be displayed on the top among the notifications from your app in the Notification Summary.

SDK update is not required to use the feature."

Campaigns and Channels 
Mobile Push 
Notification Features and Behavior
Android Push Notification Channels

Android Push Notification Channels were introduced in Android Oreo (Android 8.0 / API Level 26) to provide a unified system to help users manage their notifications. Users can now change preferences for an individual notification channel (such as opt-outs, vibration, and so on) instead of changing it for all notifications from a specific app.

What Do You Need to Do?

If your app targets Android Oreo (Android 8.0 / API level 26) and later, you must implement one or more notification channels to display notifications to your users. If you do not target Android Oreo but your app is used on devices running Android Oreo, your app behaves the same as it would on devices running Android 7.1 (API level 25) or older.

To use notification channels:

Update the Android SDK version of MoEngage to v8.0.00.
After you update the SDK version, add your existing notification channels created by your App developers on MoEngage dashboard to use them in your campaigns. You can add them while creating your campaigns by clicking + Manage notification channel in the Notification Channel drop-down list in Android messaging.

After you add a notification channel, you can select and save it as Default (optional) to populate it as the default selection for the campaigns that you will create in the future.


Select any one of the channels for your campaign as you deem fit. All notifications posted to the same notification channel have the same behavior.
If an invalid channel ID is added or you miss adding one, MoEngage uses the ""general"" channel (a MoEngage fallback channel) to target your users on Android 8.0 (API level 26) and later.

info	

Information

MoEngage does not allow you to create, read, update, or delete any notification channel for/from your app on the fly. Your app developers must create, update, or delete the notification channels if required.
How Can End Users Control Their Experience?

App developers cannot programmatically modify the behavior of a notification channel after it is created and submitted to the notification manager. The user is in charge of those settings after creation. 

End users can visit Settings or long-press a notification to change these behaviors, or they can even block a notification channel at any time. When a user modifies the behavior for any of the following characteristics, it applies to the notification channel:

Importance
Sound
Lights
Vibration

Android Push Heads-Up Notifications
Overview

A heads-up notification is a high-priority push notification in Android. The heads-up notification appears as a temporary banner at the top of the screen, overlaying the current app, to capture the user's attention. The notification automatically disappears after a few seconds unless the user interacts with it.

Heads-up notifications are triggered when the priority of the push notification channel is set to High. For more information on the notification channel on Android, see here.

info	

Information

If not interacted with, the heads-up notification gets dismissed automatically after 5–8 seconds.
If the user interacts with the notification, it remains in the floating window instead of getting auto-dismissed.
Use Cases

Following are some of the use cases for this feature:

Notify the users about limited-time offers or flash sales, ensuring immediate visibility and prompt quick action.
Remind users about an abandoned cart with an exclusive discount, encouraging them to complete the purchase.
Alert users about payment failures or account security issues, ensuring timely awareness and response.
Heads Up Notifications in MoEngage

You can configure the heads-up notifications in MoEngage using two methods:

Reposting method (Default method)
Direct posting method 
Reposting Method (Default Method)

The reposting method is the default method of MoEngage. This method ensures consistent behavior across devices while maintaining message reliability. It works as follows:

First, the notification is posted with text content.
After the first post, assets are downloaded (for example, images and media).
The notification is then reposted with template content (for example, background color, timer, and progress bar) and the downloaded assets.

In this method:

Any failure in asset downloads or notification updates does not impact the core message delivery. The end user always sees at least the backup text.
The heads-up notification, which typically appears for 5–8 seconds, is dismissed abruptly without a smooth animation. As a result, users may experience a jittery transition from basic content to template content.
Direct Posting Method
info	

Information

The direct posting method is available only in Android 8 (Oreo) or later versions.

Ensure that you have MoEngage Android SDK version 13.06.00 and later to enable the direct posting method.

In the direct posting method, assets are first downloaded, and then the notification is posted with those assets.
With this method, the user experiences heads-up notifications as intended. The template content is displayed directly in the notification, remaining in the heads-up area for 5–8 seconds.

In this method, if there's a delay in downloading media assets due to a poor internet connection or an internal error related to building the template content, the notification will not be visible to the end user. However, MoEngage SDK still generates a Notification received Android event.

To configure this method, refer here.

info	

Information

For the carousel template, interacting with the carousel removes the notification from the Heads-up area but keeps it in the notification drawer.

Limitations and Expected Behaviors of Notifications

This section outlines the observed limitations and expected behaviors of notifications across various Android devices and OS versions.

The expanded notification view is unavailable on Android 9, 10, and 11 Devices. There is no drop-down button to expand the notification.
Expanded View of Heads-Up Notifications
General behavior: When expanded, the heads-up notification remains in the floating window until the user interacts with it or receives another notification.
Samsung devices: To view the heads-up notification in expanded view, adjust the Notification Pop-up Style under Advanced Settings.
OnePlus devices: The heads-up notification does not have a drop-down button for Basic, Timer, and Timer with Progress Bar templates, preventing expansion in the floating window.
Heads-Up Notification Dismissal on App Exit/Background
Mi devices: The heads-up notification is dismissed when the user exits the app or sends it to the background.
Samsung and Pixel devices: The notification remains visible in the floating window.
Heads-Up Notifications in Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode
Samsung devices: The notification appears in a floating window with sound.
Mi devices: The notification appears only in the notification drawer with sound.
info	

Information

The heads-up feature may not work if the device is in Do Not Disturb mode.

Best Practices
The MoEngage SDK uses the Reposting method by default to maximize notification visibility in the notification drawer.
If you have set up High priority channels and want better visibility in the heads-up area, use the Direct posting method. Ensure that media assets comply with size guidelines for optimal visibility. For more information, see here.
MoEngage recommends labeling channel names as heads-up on the dashboard to help campaign creators identify these notifications and use media assets judiciously. This channel name is for internal reference only and will not be visible to end users."

Notification Features and Behavior
Push Notification Sounds

Sounds when notifications are delivered depend on the following:

Integrated sounds at the app level or channel level
Campaign setup
User device notification settings for the app
User device conditions at the time of delivery

This article explains how notification sounds work in all conditions.

Android

In Android Oreo (8.0) and onwards, notification sounds are controlled by Notification Channels.

Implementation

When you create a notification channel on your app, the sound of the notification channel depends on the following:

Sound you set for the channel. If no custom sound is set, the system will play the default notification sound defined by the app.
Interruption level of the channel.

Please refer to the Android developer documentation for Creating and managing notification channels.

User-level device settings

The user can always override these settings at a device level:

By turning off sounds for all notifications from device volume settings.
Inside the channel's settings is an option for 'Sound'. Users can tap on it and choose a different sound from the list, or select None if they don't want any sound for that channel.
By turning off push permissions for the channel.
Using in Campaigns

After adding your channels to the app, you can add notification channels to the MoEngage Dashboard. Notifications sent through these channels will follow the sound and importance configuration set for the respective channel.

iOS

This section describes how notification sounds work on iOS.

Implementation

In your app, you can define a custom sound to be played when a notification is delivered. This is typically a short audio file included in the app bundle.

You can package the audio data in an aiff, wav, or caf file. Sound files must be less than 30 seconds in length. If the sound file is longer than 30 seconds, the system plays the default sound instead. For more information, refer to UNNotificationSound Apple documentation.

User-level device settings

Regardless of the app's implementation, users have control over the notification sounds through the Settings app on their device.

Users can go to Settings > Notifications, select the app, and under the Sounds setting, choose the notification sound for that app.
If the device is on silent mode or Focus mode or if Do Not Disturb is enabled, the sound may not play depending on the interruption level of the notification.
Using in Campaigns
Notification Sound

When creating a push notification campaign for iOS, provide the sound filename in the Sound field as shown below:

If an incorrect name or a blank value is sent in the sound, the default notification sound will be used instead.

Interruption Level

Interruption levels (passive, active, time-sensitive, critical) determine how a notification is presented to the user and whether it breaks through Focus modes or Do Not Disturb.

The sound property is still specified in the notification payload or content, but the interruption level may override the device settings to allow or prevent the sound from playing based on the user's current focus setting.

For example, a notification with a time-sensitive interruption level might still play a sound even if the user has Do Not Disturb enabled, because it is deemed important enough to break through those settings. For more information, refer to Notifications in iOS 15."

Push Notification behavior in Private Space and Hidden Mode
Private Space in Android 15

In Android 15, google introduced Private Space, a feature that allows users to create a separate, secure area on their devices for sensitive applications. This space operates under a distinct user profile and requires additional authentication. For more information, see here.

Notification Behavior of Apps in Private Space

The following scenarios are applicable when the app is in the private space:

Whenever a notification is posted by an application installed in the private space, it has a lock icon indicating it is from an application in the private space.
The notification behavior for applications installed in private spaces varies depending on the space's state, i.e., locked or unlocked.
When the space is unlocked, notifications are received and displayed as usual, like any application in the main space.
When the private space is locked:
The application does not display any notifications.
Once the space is unlocked, notifications received while the space is locked are displayed or delivered to the application.
When a space is transitioned to the locked state from the unlocked state, the system dismisses/clears all private space app notifications from the notification shade.
Expired messages based on the Expiration settings before the space is unlocked are not displayed/delivered to the application, and the associated notification impressions are not captured for such messages.

Hidden Mode in iOS 18

In iOS 18, Apple introduced Hidden Mode, a new feature that allows users to lock and hide apps. This enhancement to privacy and security enhances the user experience. For more information, see here.

With this feature, you can add additional security for app launch:

Require user authentication (face ID, Touch ID, or password)
Hide and require authentication.
Notification Behavior of Apps in Hidden Mode

The following scenarios are applicable when the app is in the hidden mode:

The app’s notifications aren’t displayed. New notifications received after the app is removed from the hidden mode are displayed.
Notification impressions are tracked regardless of whether the app is in hidden mode and whether the notification is displayed or not."

Notification Update
Overview

The Notification Update feature updates an existing push notification in the users' notification drawer by sending a new notification with the same Update key. This feature helps keep notifications relevant and prevents clutter.

Use Cases

The following are some use cases for this feature:

Order tracking: Update users with the latest delivery status of their package by overriding the initial shipment confirmation message using the order ID.
E-commerce: If a user is eligible for multiple offers that can't be combined, you can use a selection key. This ensures the user sees only one relevant offer at a time, preventing confusion and making their shopping experience smooth and clear.
Media and entertainment: You can update a breaking news alert with the latest confirmed details after the initial notification.
Travel and hospitality: You can update gate change information for a flight directly within the initial boarding reminder notification. For more information, refer here.
Gaming: Inform players of an unscheduled server maintenance update, overriding the initial event reminder.
How Notification Update Works
library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the MoEngage Android SDK version 14.00.00 and later with the ismultiplenotificationsindrawer config set to true to access the Notification Update feature on Android devices.
Ensure you have MoEngage iOS SDK version 9.24.0 and later to access the Notification Update feature.

Perform the following steps to update your push notifications:

In the second step of push campaign creation, Content, expand the Advanced tab.
In the Update key field under the Advanced section, enter a unique string value.
This field accepts a single input string.
It supports personalization.
MoEngage automatically modifies the update key to ensure it does not exceed the 45-character limit. It removes non-Latin scripts, special characters, and spaces to restrict the key composition to ASCII characters exclusively.
This update ID will be used to identify and update related push notifications. Ensure you use the same update ID for all push notifications intended to update each other.
Complete the remaining steps of the push campaign creation process and send your campaign.
Example

We will create a Push campaign for a new app called MoEngage Travels. This app wants to send push notifications to update the gate information for a flight directly within the initial boarding reminder notification sent to passengers departing from London International Airport.

Scenario (Flight LH456 departure):

Initial boarding reminder (sent 2 hours before departure):
Content: Reminder: Your flight LH456 to London departs at 3:00 PM from Gate D7. Please proceed to the gate.
Update key: flightlh456update
Gate change update (sent 1 hour before departure):
Content: Important Update: The departure gate for your flight LH456 to London has changed to Gate C2. Please proceed to the new gate.
Update key: flightlh456update
Outcome

The Push campaign for the MoEngage Travels app successfully updated the initial boarding reminder notification with the new gate information for flight LH 456. Using the same update key (flightlh456update), the gate change message updated the initial notification, ensuring passengers receive accurate and timely updates without duplication.

Campaign Analytics

The analytics section contains information about the performance stats and revenue metrics.

Global Analytics Filters

These filters are applied to all the sections in the Analytics tab.

Date Range- Select the date range for which you want to view the performance stats.
Attribution Type- Select the attribution type (Click through, In-session, and View through) to view the analytics information for the specified attribution type. The default attribution type is View through attribution. Refer to the paragraph below for information on attribution types. For more information, refer to the paragraph below.
Platform- Select the platform for which you want to view the performance stats. The default is 'All platforms' in case the campaign is targeting multiple Platforms.

Attribution Types - You can track your conversion via three methods: View through, click-through, and in-session attribution. With conversion tracking, marketers can see which campaigns have led to achieving business goals (conversion goals for the campaign). If a customer clicked your push and converted, it would be termed a click-through conversion, and if a customer saw your push and didn't click it but converted afterward, it would be termed a view-through conversion. In-session conversions are those conversions that were made within 30 minutes after the notification click.

For example, consider the case where three customers, namely Users A, B, and C, received your push message from campaign C1.

User A clicked on the message and did the conversion event within 30 minutes (we assume it to be the same session) of clicking.
User B clicked on the message and did the conversion event 2-3 hours after clicking.
User C saw your message, later launched the app directly, and made the conversion.

When you attribute this conversion to campaign C1, User A is direct attribution, while User B and C are indirect attributions.

Attribution Type	Description	Example
View through	

The view through attribution is an Impression based tracking and is displayed by default when campaign analytics is loaded. View-through attribution is the total number of conversion goals executed by users who received your communication within the configured attribution window from the time of receiving the campaign. This appears as a default filter in your Campaign Performance.

	If the user received your push message at 7 am and your Attribution window was 12 hours, the user conversion events till 7 pm will be attributed to this campaign using View-Through Attribution.
Click through	

Click-through attribution is click-based tracking. Click-through attribution is the number of conversion goals executed by users who clicked the notification within the configured attribution window from the time of click.

	If the user receives your push message at 7 am, clicks it at 8 am, and your Attribution window is 12 hours, the user conversion events till 8 pm are attributed to this campaign in Click-Through Attribution.
In-session	

The in-session attribution is based on In-session tracking. The in-session attribution is the number of conversion goals executed by users within 30 minutes after clicking your communication.

	

If the user receives your push message at 7 am, clicks it at 8 am, and your Attribution window is 12 hours, the user conversion events till 8:30 am (within 30 minutes of starting the session) will be attributed to this campaign in In-Session Attribution.

 

Attribution Window - Attribution Window is the duration calculated from the time a user receives or clicks the campaign having specific conversion goals. For example, two campaigns with a conversion goal as a purchase are created. Campaign C1 at time H hours and campaign C2 at H+12 hours. The customer achieves the conversion goal for purchase with the campaigns C1 and C2 at time H+15 hours. The conversion of customers is attributed both to C1 and C2.

In MoEngage campaigns, the maximum attribution window is 36 hours. When you send more than one campaign with a difference of less than 36 hours, then set the attribution window:

Lesser than 36 hours
With the duration difference in sending the campaigns.

For example, if you are sending campaigns at the difference of 12 hours, then set the attribution window as 12 hours.

Campaign Performance Stats

Campaign performance provides the impact of the push campaigns. Some campaigns contain the impact of Push Amplification (Push Amp+ or Push Amp) on these metrics. For more details, please check these articles for Push Amp or Push Amp+.

Actions that can be performed in the stats section

Choose the number view or the percentage view to see the stats as numbers or percentage values.
View the unique or total occurrences of stats by selecting Unique or Total in the dropdown at the top of the section.
Pin metrics - you can pin the metrics you want to see using the Pin metrics dropdown at the top right corner. You can pin up to five metrics. The selected metric pins are available in the Pinned metrics section. Click Show all metrics to see all the metrics being tracked for the campaign and Hide unpinned metrics to see only the pinned metrics for the campaign.

The following campaign performance stats are available:

Conversion Metrics - These metrics pertain to the conversion goals set for the campaign. The higher these metrics, the more effective your campaign! The conversion metrics tracked for your push campaigns are shown in the table below.
Metric	Description
Converted Users	

This metric shows the number of unique users who have completed the primary conversion. Converted Users were previously called Conversions. This metric displays the number of times users converted from each campaign notification. For campaigns having only one recurrence, conversion represents unique users who have accomplished the primary conversion goal event at least once within the attribution window. For active campaigns, conversions represent the number of unique users converted per instance of an active campaign. Higher conversions indicate higher effectiveness of your campaign in driving the business goals. 

 

Example

If a user receives one Campaign Instance on Day X and another on Day Y and converts once on both days, the conversions are counted as two (instead of being counted as one in the previous version.)
If a user receives one campaign instance on Day X and converts twice from the same campaign, conversions will be counted as 1.
If a user receives two campaign instances of the same campaign on Day X and converts for both of them, conversions will be counted as 2. 

Event (Primary)	

This metric shows the total number of primary conversion goal events within the attribution window (configurable) from the time user received the notification.

 

You can also view the uplift percentage in the event primary card. For more information, refer to Uplift in Campaigns.

 

Event (Primary) for Event-Triggered, Location-Triggered, and User-Level Transaction Push - The conversions for active campaigns are several conversion events from all campaign notifications. The metric is the cumulative primary conversion events after the start of the first campaign.

 

Example

 

Suppose a user receives a notification for a purchased campaign. If the user made two purchases, then the conversion events are two.



Conversion Rate(CVR)	

This metric shows the percentage ratio of users who have performed the conversion event. The conversion count is tracked as Unique. Higher conversion events indicate higher effectiveness of your campaign in driving the business goals.

 

CVR for the various attribution types are listed below:

View through attribution CVR = ((Unique conversions) / (Total impressions)) * 100
Click through attribution CVR = ((Unique conversions) / (Total clicks)) * 100
In-session attribution CVR = ((Unique conversions) / (Total clicks)) * 100

Revenue Metrics	

There are three revenue metrics for your campaign if they are enabled for the primary goal.

Total Campaign Revenue is the sum of the total order value across conversion events attributed to the campaign.
Average Order value = (Total Revenue/ Number of conversion events)
Average Revenue per user = (Total Revenue/ Number of unique conversions)

These revenue metrics are tracked for all attribution types- View through, Click Through, and In-session attribution.

Delivery Metrics - Three delivery metrics are tracked for your push campaigns. They are:
Attempted - This metric shows the number of users who qualified for the campaign and for whom MoEngage tried sending the message. Attempted users count is derived from ‘Active Device Tokens’.
Sent - This metric represents the Sent rate and shows the percentage of campaigns that were sent out of the campaigns that were attempted to be sent by MoEngage. Sent rate is calculated as (Sent/Attempted)*100.
Failed To Send - This metric represents the Failed rate and shows the percentage of campaigns that failed out of the campaigns that were attempted to be sent by MoEngage. Failed rate is calculated as (Failed To Send/Attempted)*100.
Engagement Metrics - Two engagement metrics are tracked for your push campaigns, and they are shown below.
Metric	Description
Impressions	

Impressions represent the number of user devices that have received the notification sent by the marketer. The impressions are counted based on the devices the user has got the notifications set on the devices. For example, the impressions are counted as two in both of the following examples:

User with two Android devices and receives notifications on both the devices
User with one Android Device and one iOS device

The impressions are counted as two in both examples. Higher impressions represent a higher reach of your notifications.

info	

Note

For iOS campaigns, the impressions are counted differently based on the 'Show iOS Impressions Toggle'. When the toggle is turned off, the Sent number equals Impressions in Campaign stats. When the toggle is turned on, the Impressions will show the impression count, which is based on the Notification Received iOS event.
MoEngage captures Impressions as an event (Notification Received iOS) and is available in Segmentation or Analytics.

Clicks	

Clicks represent the total number of notifications clicked by the users after the notification delivery. The clicks are counted based on the devices the user has got the notifications set on the devices. For example, if a user has two Android devices:

Receives notifications on both devices
Clicks these notifications on both devices

Then the clicks are counted as two. Higher click numbers suggest that the users who received your notification message found it interesting and ended up clicking it. It might be because of the appeal of your message, timing, or relevance to the end user. Lower numbers represent the opposite.


Click through Rate	

The percentage ratio of total clicks for push notifications successfully sent.

 

Note: This metric is available only when Total occurrences are chosen in the dropdown at the beginning of the Campaign Performance Stats section.

 

Click through rate = ((Total clicks) / (Total Impressions)) * 100

Time Trends

The campaign performance stats are represented graphically (chart view) or in a tabular view in this section. You can:

View the information in the following granularities:
Hours
Days
Weeks
Months

Group by variation - Lists performance of each metric in all locales grouped by the variation. Hover over the bar chart to understand how each locale has performed for the specific metric in a variation.  
Conversion Goals Performance

You will be able to see this section when you have set more than one conversion goal for your campaigns. The section compares the performance of goals set by the marketer for the campaign.

Total Conversions: Will show all goal events for the respective goals i.e. if a user made a purchase twice, it will be shown twice. It is the equivalent of conversion events covered in the sections above.

Unique Conversions: Goals are unique across the users converted per campaign instance. It is the equivalent of the Conversions metric covered in the sections above.

You can view the uplift percentage in the tabular view of Conversion Goals performance. For more information, refer to Uplift in Campaigns.


Campaign Delivery

The metrics can be viewed as numbers with the percentages shown above them:

Funnel Stage	What it represents
Reachable Users in Segment	

Represents the total number of users that satisfy the campaign segmentation criteria and have at least one active push token (against any of the mobile devices or web devices)

For triggered campaigns (Event/Device/Location triggered), this represents the total number of triggers such reachable users have received and not unique reachable users.


After FC Removal	Represents the number of users who meet the reachable users in segment condition and do not breach Frequency Capping (FC) criteria.
Active Device Tokens	

Represent the number of active tokens available across all eligible users (users who satisfy these conditions - No breaching of FC, Are reachable, and so on). The active device tokens can exceed 100% as multiple devices could be associated with the user.


Sent	Represents the number of devices for which notification was sent successfully to GCM or APNS. Please note that this number does not guarantee that GCM/APNS can deliver to these many devices.
Impressions	Represents the number of user devices that have received the notification sent by the marketer.
Error breakdown

This section details the number of campaign delivery failures and their reasons. For more information, refer to Troubleshooting Common Push errors.

Personalization Errors

You can see personalization errors in the Failed to send error category in the Error Breakdown Table. Click See breakdown in the Name column for Personalization errors to get a detailed view of the number of users for whom personalization has failed and their reasons.

For more information on personalization Errors, refer to Common Personalization Errors and FAQs.

Content API Analysis

In the case of a response other than 2xx, you will see the error code or the response of your Content API in the Content API analysis section below the error breakdown table, as shown below.

info	

Note

If the Content API being used in the campaign does not provide a 2xx/successful response, campaigns might still be delivered if the empty response has been handled in your JINJA code added in Step 2 of Campaign Creation (the content/message creation step).

Best Time to Send

BTS campaigns use MoEngage's AI SHERPA to estimate the best time to deliver a push campaign to a specific user based on their past engagement trends. For more information, refer to BTS.

This section showcases the stats for users for whom the campaign was delivered at the following times:

Push Amplification™ and Delivery Impact

This article describes Push Amplification™, the first version of the Push Amplification™ solution of MoEngage, and its impact on reach or impressions for your campaigns.

info	

Information

The impact of Push Amplification™ is visible on the dashboard only for the campaigns created after April 3rd, 2020, 12:00 AM GMT.
What Is Push Amplification™ and How It Works?

Push Amplification™ is a fallback delivery service, which is used if the FCM notification delivery fails. When a notification delivery fails, Push Amplification™ detects this failure and delivers these notifications directly to app users’ devices thereby reaching those users who would have otherwise been missed by FCM. For more information on Push Amplification™, refer to this page.

To enable Push Amplification™ for your account, raise a support ticket. For more information, refer to Raise a Support Ticket Through MoEngage Dashboard.

info	

Information

Push Amplification™ works only for Android. It is available for One-Time Push, Periodic Push, Event-Triggered Push, Location-Triggered Push, and Push sent using Flows campaigns.
It is not applicable on Device-Triggered Push.
Measure Uplifts by Push Amplification™

After Push Amplification™ is successfully enabled for your account, when you configure a campaign, you can measure the impact of Push Amplification™ on that campaign Impression and Clicks. After the campaign is sent, go to Campaign > Analytics and select Android as Platform.

 

The contribution by Push Amplification™ is shown in yellow. You can hover over the yellow and green parts in the donut to determine the number of impressions obtained through Push Amplification™ with regard to impressions obtained through FCM. The same is applicable for the Clicks donut.

Under each donut, the % uplift by Push Amplification™ is shown. You can hover over the % uplift numbers to understand the individual contribution by FCM and the total contribution.

 

How Uplifts are calculated?

This section explains the formulas used for calculating the uplifts.

Uplift in Impressions
Uplift in Clicks

FCM is the base for all the calculations. % Uplift for Impressions is calculated by first calculating the contribution of Push Amplification™ in campaign delivery rate and then dividing it by the FCM delivery rate.  Here, delivery rate is Impressions or Notifications sent. 

The following formulas explain how we calculate contribution of Push Amplification™ in campaign delivery rate. For this, the contribution of FCM to campaign delivery rate is subtracted from overall campaign delivery rate.

 

info	

Note

Uplift in conversions and conversion goals are currently not available. MoEngage is working on these features and they will be available shortly.
Push Amplification™ is an Android-based feature, so the Impressions and Clicks uplifts are applicable only for Android.
We show uplift for Impressions for All Platforms to provide an indication of Push Amplification™ impact on an overall level. However, the uplift in Clicks for Android as opposed to uplift in Clicks for All Platforms always remains the same, hence Clicks uplift is not shown for All Platforms.
Push Amplification™ data and uplift is shown for All Locales. We are currently not tracking locale-specific data for Push Amplification™.
We started tracking clicks for Push Amplification™ only from SDK version 9.8.02 onwards, so the Click uplift might be lower than the actual uplift.
Push Amplification™ is a backup delivery service, so notifications attempted through Push Amplification™ are not counted in the sent count. However, if the user receives the notification through Push Amplification™, the impressions are counted. This may lead to scenarios where the Impression count is higher than the Sent count.
For Example. If the notification sending fails for all users' devices for a campaign because of ""Google Authentication Error (GAE)"", the sent count is 0. But you may receive Impressions and Clicks for this campaign because they are delivered with Push Amplification™."

Information

The impact of Push Amplification™ Plus is visible on the dashboard only for the campaigns created after April 3rd, 2020, 12:00 AM GMT.
Why Do We Need Push Amplification™?

Push notifications are reliable ways of engaging your mobile app users. To successfully run any engagement or retention program, marketers want to maximize the reach of their campaigns. But in the case of Android, the notifications never reach 40–70% of your users. There are multiple reasons why your users do not receive the notifications sent by you. For more information, refer to Why users are not receiving push notifications sent by you?

Push Amplification™ Plus helps marketers improve the delivery of their push notifications so that their messages can reach more users.

What is Push Amplification™ Plus?

Push Amplification™ Plus is an advanced version of Push Amplification™, the industry-first Push Amplification™ solution of MoEngage, built to increase push notification delivery rates by a maximum of 40% across Android device manufacturers. Additionally, our customers have witnessed an uplift in push delivery rates by a maximum of 75% on Xiaomi devices.

Push Amplification™ Plus is a combination of two services:

An enhanced push notification delivery service for the eligible set of devices
A fallback delivery service(known as Push Amplification™) used if FCM notification delivery fails
How Does Push Amplification™ Plus Work?

Marketers can choose to use Push Amplification™ Plus for their campaigns while sending them. For campaigns using Push Amplification™ Plus, an eligible set of devices that are reachable using Push Amplification™ Plus is identified from the target segment. These eligible devices are sent notifications directly by Push Amplification™ Plus. These devices are not targeted by FCM because the delivery rate through Push Amplification™ Plus is higher than FCM.

The rest of the devices in the target segment that are not eligible for the Push Amplification™ Plus service are sent notifications through FCM. If FCM delivery fails Push Amplification™ starts working. Push Amplification™ detects the failure in notification delivery and acts as a fallback to the FCM, thereby delivering the notification to users' devices. This helps marketers reach those users who would have otherwise been missed by FCM. This amplifies the reach and improves overall delivery rates by a maximum of 40%. For more information, refer to this page.

How to Enable Push Amplification™ Plus?

To enable Push Amplification™ Plus for your account, raise a support ticket. For more information, refer to Raise a Support Ticket Through MoEngage Dashboard.

After Push Amplification™ Plus is successfully enabled for your account, you can use Push Amplification™ Plus at the campaign level. This means that you can enable Push Amplification™ Plus for some Push campaigns and not use it for other campaigns and compare overall delivery with the ones not using Push Amplification™ Plus.

To use Push Amplification™ Plus for a campaign:

On the ""Target user"" page, select the platform as Android.
Select the Send this campaign using Push Amplification™ Plus checkbox.

info	

Information

Push Amplification™ works only for Android. It is available for One Time Push, Periodic Push, Event-Triggered Push, Location-Triggered Push, and Push sent using Flows campaigns.
It is not applicable on Device-Triggered Push.
Because Push Amplification™ Plus is an advanced version of Push Amplification™, enabling Push Amplification™ Plus also enables Push Amplification™ with it.
Measure Uplifts by Push Amplification™ Plus

After Push Amplification™ Plus is successfully enabled for your account, when you configure a campaign, you can measure the impact of Push Amplification™ Plus on that campaign's Impression and Clicks. After the campaign is sent, go to Campaign > Analytics and select Android as Platform.

The contribution by Push Amplification™ Plus is shown in yellow. You can hover over the yellow and green parts in the donut to determine the number of impressions obtained through Push Amplification™ Plus with regard to impressions obtained through FCM. The same is applicable for the Clicks donut.

Under each donut, the % uplift by Push Amplification™ Plus is shown. You can hover over the % uplift numbers to understand the individual contribution by FCM and the total contribution.

In some campaigns, the % uplift values are not shown under the Impression or Click graph in spite of some contribution to these metrics through Push Amplification™ Plus. It means that the % uplift by Push Amplification™ Plus is 0 and hence it is not shown on the dashboard.

In the following example, there is a positive % uplift in Impressions. But the Push Amplification™ Plus contribution to Clicks data is so small that it is negligible or 0 % uplift.

If you create a campaign with Push Amplification™ Plus disabled, the campaign is served by FCM including the devices that are eligible for Push Amplification™ Plus. If FCM delivery fails, Push Amplification™ starts working, provided Push Amplification™ is enabled for your account. In such cases, you will see uplifts or impacts through Push Amplification™ .

The same rules apply to Push Amplification™ Stats, as mentioned for Push Amplification™ Plus above.

After you send the campaign, you can check the Push Amplification™ Plus status on the Campaign Info page. If you enabled Push Amplification™ Plus in the campaign, Send via Push Amplification™ Plus: indicates ""Yes"". If you disabled Push Amplification™ Plus in the campaign, Send via Push Amplification™ Plus: indicates ""No"".

How Will The Upcoming Updates To MoEngage's Server Certificates For APNS Impact Users?
Problem

Apple is updating the server certificates for the Apple Push Notification service (APNS) in sandbox and production environments, with deadlines set for January 20, 2025, and February 24, 2025, respectively. Users may wonder if these changes require action to maintain uninterrupted push notification delivery.

Solution

MoEngage handles all required updates, including adding the new SHA-2 Root certificate to the Trust Store. Users do not need to:

Update their application's Trust Store.
Make changes to the MoEngage dashboard.
Adjust their application's integration with the MoEngage SDK.

MoEngage manages all changes, including:

Integrating the new SHA-2 root certificate into the Trust Store.
Including old and new certificates in the Trust Store before the deadlines.
Ensuring a seamless transition and uninterrupted iOS push notifications.

Troubleshooting and FAQs - Mobile Push
Why Aren't Deeplinks in Push Notifications Working on Android Devices?
Problem

Deeplinks in push notifications are not working on Android devices.

Solution

Deeplinks are supported in Android app development and by MoEngage. To verify if the deeplink implementation is correct on the developer’s end, perform the following steps:

Test the deeplink URL. Ensure the deeplink URL correctly opens the app from a third-party app (such as WhatsApp, Slack, or a web browser) using the same link used in the campaign. If it fails to open, the issue is likely with the developer's implementation. MoEngage uses native deeplink functions provided by Android. For more information on implementation deeplinks, refer to the official Android documentation:

Create Deep Links to App Content
Handling Android App Links
For Hybrid Frameworks. In some hybrid frameworks, developers use routes to navigate within the app. However, these routes may not work when opened from outside the app, as they are generally effective only with the app. For proper deeplink integration, refer to the Android documentation listed above.
 If deeplinks work from third-party apps but not with MoEngage push notifications:
If the MoEngage SDK creates the push notification, the SDK may be using an outdated deeplink URL format and appending MoEngage data to the URL, which could prevent proper parsing. If this occurs, raise a support ticket.
If the MoEngage SDK does not create the push notification, the app developer must check the deeplink implementation in their code."

Troubleshooting and FAQs - Mobile Push
Why Aren't Push Campaign Impressions Tracked on Android Devices?
Problem

The MoEngage SDK does not track Push campaign impressions on Android devices or SDKs.

Solution

Push campaign impression issues can be due to several factors:

When MoEngage SDK handles push notifications by default:
Confirm SDK initialization. Check if the SDK is initialized with a delay.
If the SDK is initialized with a delay, change the SDK initialization to the default configuration, as specified in the following MoEngage documentation links. Initialize the SDK in the onCreate() method of the Application class on the main thread, not in any callbacks.
Android Native
React Native
Flutter
Cordova
Unity
Capacitor
Check for network issues. Network issues (such as Private DNS or AdBlocker) might prevent data from syncing from the SDK to the MoEngage backend. 
When MoEngage SDK handles push notifications with customizations:
Confirm SDK initialization. Ensure the SDK is not initialized with a delay (see the point above).
Check the PushMessageListener/PluginPushCallback code. Verify that the Builder does not interfere with the MoEngage SDK's callbacks.
When the app handles push notifications:
Confirm SDK initialization. Ensure the SDK is not initialized with a delay (see the point above).
Verify push notification handling. Confirm that the app developer has notified the MoEngage SDK when a push notification is received. The App should create the push notification using the logNotificationReceived() method in the onMessageReceived() callback. For more information, refer to Push Display Handled by Application."

Why Aren't Push Templates Displaying Correctly in iOS Push Notifications?
Problem

Push templates (carousel images, background color, font color, and so on) do not display correctly in Push notifications on iOS devices.

Solution

Perform the following steps to resolve the issue:

Identify the MoEngage SDK version used in your app. To find the SDK version, open your podfile.lock, search for MoEngage-iOS-SDK, and note the version listed.
Verify whether the Notification Service Extension and Notification Content Extension are implemented in your app.

Why Are Deeplinks in Push Notifications Not Working on iOS Devices?
Problem

Deeplinks in push notifications are not working on iOS devices.

Solution

Perform the following steps:

Deeplinks are a feature in iOS App development that MoEngage supports. To verify whether the deeplink implementation is correct on the developer’s end, ensure the deeplink URL properly redirects and opens the app from a third-party app like WhatsApp, Slack, or a web browser using the same link as in the campaign.
If the deeplink fails to work, the issue is likely with the implementation on the developer's end. MoEngage uses native deeplink functions provided by Apple, located in the AppDelegate file.

	  MoEngageSDKAnalytics.sharedInstance.processURL(url) //9.xx

	func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) - Void) - Bool {

	  if userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb ,

	    let incomingURL = userActivity.webpageURL{

	    //Call only if MoEngageAppDelegateProxyEnabled is NO in Info.plist

	    MoEngageSDKAnalytics.sharedInstance.processURL(incomingURL) //9.xx

	    MoEngage.sharedInstance().processURL(incomingURL) //8.xx //7.xx

	  }

	  //rest of the implementation

	  return true

	  return true;

	}
If deeplinks from third-party apps are working but not with MoEngage push notifications in all app states, follow the instructions from the appropriate link based on your development framework (React-Native, Flutter, Native iOS), AppDelegate file (Swift, Objective-C), and MoEngage SDK version:
For projects using React-Native, Objective-C, and MoEngage-iOS-SDK (7.x.x | 8.x.x | 9.x.x) where deeplinks are not working in all app states, refer to How to Avoid Common Push Notification Issues on iOS Devices Using React-Native, Objective-C, and MoEngage-iOS-SDK (Versions 7.x.x , 8.x.x, 9.x.x)?

For projects using Native IOS, Swift, and MoEngage-iOS-SDK (7.x.x | 8.x.x | 9.x.x) where deeplinks are not working in all app states, refer to How to Avoid Common Push Notification Issues on iOS Devices Using Native iOS, Swift, and MoEngage-iOS-SDK (Versions 7.x.x , 8.x.x, 9.x.x)?

If deeplinks are not working only when the app is in a killed state, follow these steps:
Verify with your development team. There may be custom splash screens implemented for app launch that could override MoEngage's deep-link redirection. If the custom splash screen is set as the rootViewController, it will intercept the redirection before it can take place.
Check the callback. In the killed state, verify whether the callback is being received in the deeplink function provided by Apple.

	- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application continueUserActivity:(NSUserActivity *)userActivity restorationHandler:(void (^)(NSArray * _Nullable))restorationHandler {

	  

	  return true;

	}
Examine breakpoints. If breakpoints are hit in any of the above functions, the responsibility for resolving the issue lies with the specific deeplink code used by the developer within that code block.

Why Do Push Notification Tests Often Fail for Mobile Numbers?
Problem

When attempting to send a test push notification campaign, the notification fails, and the following message is displayed:

Installed User not found for Mobile Number = 0000000000



Solution
Use the unique ID field of reachable user instead of the Mobile Number attribute to ensure push notifications are sent.
The unique ID field can be found in the user profile with the name ID.


The unique ID is unique to each user and is used to determine whether the user can receive push notifications.​​"

How to Check if a User is Part of a Campaign Segment?

To check if a user is part of a campaign segment in MoEngage, follow these steps:

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Segments, and then click Create segment.

On the Create Segment page, use the same segment definition that was used in the campaign.
Specify the time range when the campaign was originally sent.

How To Use the Push API To Send Notifications to Users Without a Custom Segment?
Problem

Unable to send notifications to a specific group of users based on their unique IDs through the Push API. It requires creating a custom segment before sending notifications, leading to inefficiency when trying to target users directly.

Solution
To send push notifications to a specific group of users based on their unique IDs using the Push API, use the single user Push API. 
Trigger the API with the same signature or ID, but modify the user ID for each individual user.
This ensures that the desired set of users receives the push notifications.


info	

Information

To send notifications to a specific group of users using segments, you can make multiple API calls, modifying the unique ID each time accordingly.
This allows you to target and send notifications to specific users within the segment."

Why Are Timezone Campaigns Experiencing Delays During Trigger?
Problem

There may be an error in the campaign setup where the time zone for a specific location is incorrectly set, causing a delay in the campaign trigger time.

For example, if a country is only 1 hour behind another country, but the campaign is set as 2 hours behind, it can result in a delay.

Solution

Warning

MoEngage does not currently support DST. If you create campaigns during DST, adjust the time manually before scheduling the campaign.

The hour difference is caused by Daylight Saving Time (DST). You can submit a feature request to the MoEngage product team through the MoEngage dashboard's Submit product idea option."

Mobile Push 
Troubleshooting and FAQs - Mobile Push
Why Are Deeplinks Not Copied from Android to iOS Push Notifications?
Problem

Deeplinks are not copied from Android to iOS push notifications.

Solution
The Android platform requires a deeplink value, whereas it is optional for iOS.
Therefore, clicking Copy from Android under Copy content ensures that all data except the deeplink value is transferred.

You can remove the Copy from Android option or choose a suitable deeplink value for the iOS platform.
Expected Behaviour 
The product's normal behavior is that deeplinks are not copied from Android to iOS push notifications. 
This occurs because not all users utilize the same deeplinks for both Android and iOS platforms. Thus, exclude the copying of deeplinks.
If a user forgets to check the iOS deeplink in the copy mode, an error occurs during validation when attempting to proceed to the next step."

Why Is Push Notification Failing With the ""Requestedentitywasnotfound"" Error?
Problem

Push notifications are failing due to the ""Requestedentitywasnotfound"" error.

Explanation

This error occurs when the FCM token you are trying to use to send a push is no longer registered. It is treated the same as a ""NotRegistered"" error, meaning the app may have been uninstalled.

Solution

Perform the following steps:

Reconnect to the database.
Ensure all tokens are active and in use.
Delete or update any unused tokens.

Troubleshooting and FAQs - Mobile Push
Why Are Android Impressions Dropping?
Problem

The Android impressions for campaigns are decreasing.

Explanation

The following are possible causes for the decreasing Android impression:

The app may not be sending the notification received events due to an integration issue. 
The segmentation criteria might differ for campaigns with lower impressions.
The number of sent notifications could be lower.
There may be changes in the App and SDK versions.
There may be changes in the Device models.
Users may have blocked notifications at the operating system level.
Network issues may prevent users from connecting to Google Cloud Messaging (GCM).
The notification's time to live (TLL) may expire before delivery.
There may be a delay between when the app is uninstalled and when GCM marks the device as inactive.
An external firewall might reject incoming packets due to security settings.

Why Push Notifications Do Not Work in the Killed State on Android?
Problem

Push notifications work when the app is in the foreground or background but not when the app is killed. This issue occurs specifically with Hybrid SDK integrations.

warning	

Warning

This is a known limitation when using ReactNative methods to pass the push payload to MoEngage. 

Explanation
The most common reason is that the SDK is not initialized correctly. For more details, refer to the SDK Initialization documentation.
Solution
If you use ReactNative methods to pass the push payload, it is recommended to allow MoEngage to handle the push payload or use Android native methods to pass it to the MoEngage SDK.
If the SDK is not initialized,
Initialize the MoEngage SDK in the Application class's onCreate() method.
Ensure the SDK is initialized on the main thread inside onCreate() and not on a worker thread."

Troubleshooting and FAQs - Mobile Push
Why Don't Push Notifications Work on iOS in All App States?
Problem

Push notifications were sent successfully from the MoEngage dashboard, but they were not delivered to the user in the foreground, background, or killed state on iOS.

Explanation

The following could be the factors for push notifications not working in all states:

The user is in the Test Environment, but push notifications were sent from the Live environment.
The user is in the Live Environment, but push notifications were sent from the Test environment.
User data is not being tracked to the correct profile. For example, push notifications are sent to the email xyz@mail_domain.com, but no data is tracked on the user's profile. This indicates an  issue with the SDK integration or that the user was logged out, causing a guest profile to be created.
Solution

Perform the following steps to resolve the issue:

Check the user profile. Verify whether recent events are being tracked on the user profile.
If no recent events are found, the wrong profile may be targeted for push notifications, indicating an SDK integration issue.
Check SDK integration. Common SDK-related issues include:
The data center was incorrectly set when initializing the SDK, or the wrong data center was used.

How to Avoid Common Push Notification Issues on iOS Devices Using React-Native, Swift, and MoEngage-iOS-SDK (Versions 7.x.x , 8.x.x, 9.x.x)?
Problem

Common issues with Push notifications, including failed delivery, screen navigation, deep linking, and rich landing, are occurring on iOS devices using React-Native, Swift, and MoEngage-iOS-SDK (Versions 7.xx, 8.x.x, 9.x.x).

Instructions

Perform the following steps:

Disable Firebase Proxy:
If you are not using Firebase push notifications, disable the Firebase proxy by adding the FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled key in info.plist with the value Boolean = False/NO.
Test the push notification. If it works, no further action is needed.
If you are using Firebase push notifications, skip this step and proceed with the following steps.
Set UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate:
In AppDelegate.swift, set UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate in the didFinishLaunch method.
If you are initializing Firebase in didFinishLaunch, do so before initializing the MoEngage SDK.
Ensure UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate is set at the start of this method.

How to Avoid Common Push Notification Issues on iOS Devices Using iOS Objective C version 9.x.x?
Problem

Common issues with Push notifications, including Push Campaign impressions not being tracked and images not rendering even though Push notifications are successfully delivered to device with Objective C version 9.x.x. 

info	

Information

For Push Campaign impressions to be tracked, verify that the Show iOS impressions toggle on the MoEngage dashboard is turned on.
Solution

Perform the following steps:

Check for app_group_id in your project’s main target for each configuration:

 

You can add the same app_group_id or different ones across configurations.

info	

Information

 

Issues may arise if your configurations use different Bundle Identifiers but share the same app_group_id. Specifically, the Notification Service Extension may fail if two apps with different Bundle Identifiers but the same app_group_id are installed on the same device.

 

To avoid this, you can use the same app_group_id across multiple configurations, but be aware that you won't be able to test all apps simultaneously on a single device.

 

 

Check for app_group_id during SDK initialization:

If the SDK is initialized using info.plist, the APP_GROUP_ID key must be there inside the MoEngage key in your info.plist file.
If the SDK is initialized using sdkConfig, the APP_GROUP_ID must be in the sdkConfig variable inside the AppDelegate file.

Enable Push Notifications: In the extension target's Signing & Capabilities section, make sure to enable Push Notifications and add the AppGroupId.

Check Build Phases for the Main App Target: In the Build Phases section of the main app target, locate the Embed App Extensions / Embed Foundation Extensions section. Ensure that the Copy only when installing option is unchecked.
Ensure Consistent appGroupId Across Configurations: Verify that the appGroupId is consistent across all schemes and configurations (e.g. Debug/Release/QA/UAT) in the project.

How to Avoid Common Push Notification Issues on iOS Devices Using iOS Swift version 8.x.x?
Problem

Common issues with Push notifications, including Push Campaign impressions not being tracked and images not rendering even though Push notifications are successfully delivered to device with Swift version 8.x.x. 

info	

Information

For Push Campaign impressions to be tracked, verify that the Show iOS impressions toggle on the MoEngage dashboard is turned on.
Solution

Perform the following steps:

Check for app_group_id in your project’s main target for each configuration:

 

You can add the same app_group_id or different ones across configurations.

info	

Information

 

Issues may arise if your configurations use different Bundle Identifiers but share the same app_group_id. Specifically, the Notification Service Extension may fail if two apps with different Bundle Identifiers but the same app_group_id are installed on the same device.

 

To avoid this, you can use the same app_group_id across multiple configurations, but be aware that you won't be able to test all apps simultaneously on a single device.

Why Does the SDK Not Trigger the 'Unsubscribed To Push' Event?
Problem

Understanding the behavior of the Subscribed to Push and Unsubscribed to Push events in the MoEngage platform, particularly on Android version 13 and above, is crucial. There is confusion about how these events are captured and reported based on responses to push notification permissions. 

info	

Information

This confusion arises when an app is installed, and Android's notification permission dialog box appears on the first launch, prompting the permission to be granted or denied.

Explanation

To clarify, let's examine the two possible actions after installing the app on Android 13 and above:

User grants permission
When push notification permissions are accepted, the app must immediately inform the MoEngage SDK to trigger the Subscribed to Push event.
This signals the SDK of the user's consent to receive push notifications.
User denies permission
If permissions are denied, the MoEngage SDK will not trigger the Unsubscribed to Push event.
On Android 13 and above, the default state is 'denied.' Because there is no change in state, the SDK does not record any event.
info	

Information

For Android 12 and below, the permission state is 'granted' by default. Because users do not actively subscribe or unsubscribe, no related events will be generated."

Why Do Push Templates Have Rendering Issues in Android?

Push template notifications look slightly different than the default notifications and also rendering issues.

Size of Push Template Notifications
Notification Type	Height in Collapse Mode	Height in Expand Mode
Native notification (Basic)	100 dp	~300 dp


Custom notification 

SDK version below 11.4.02 and Push templates module version below 2.4.0

	64 dp	256 dp


Custom notification 

SDK version 11.4.02 and above and Push templates module version 2.4.0 and above

	100 dp	287 dp
Push Templates with 64 dp Height

The dimensions for custom Push notification are inline with the Android guidelines for custom notifications. 

Because of the lesser height in custom notifications, the height of the default notification is bigger than the customized notification. The reason for this is that the custom Push notification with height > 64 dp was failing on some devices. And because dynamic layouts are not feasible, MoEngage restricted the height to the dimensions according to Android guidelines.

In the expanded mode, the available area for an image is as follows:

Available Image Height	Buttons Present
192 dp	No
152 dp	Yes

Because of the restricted space in the expanded mode, the images might get cropped even though those images appear fine in the native notifications.

Push Templates with 100 dp Height
The new and improved Push templates with more area are available for SDK version 11.4.02 and above and the Push templates module version 2.4.0 and above.
The look and feel of the improved notifications is similar to that of basic notifications in terms of font size, spacing, and padding. 
MoEngage supports customization of the app name and color. MoEngage is testing more original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and will whitelist the OEMs.
The 100 dp notifications will only work for whitelisted OEMs because the 100 dp customization doesn't render properly on all devices, mostly due to various skin customizations done by OEMs on top of the operating system. As of now, Google, OnePlus, Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, and Motorola are whitelisted. MoEngage is working on adding more OEMs to this list.
In addition to this, we have the provision of whitelisting OEMs at the workspace level. This means that you can choose to whitelist more OEMs or blacklist the one that is already whitelisted, after doing due diligence at your end. Raise a support ticket to modify the set of whitelisted OEMs.
Whitelisting approach:
For each OEM, we have tested the latest 3 skin versions because the notification behavior changes with reference to different skin versions. This will cover the latest 3 Android versions (Android 11, 10, and 9). Android 12 is not on the consideration list because the notification layout for Android 12 is very different.
If 100 dp renders fine for all the 3 latest skin versions, MoEngage will whitelist the OEM else will consider each OEM on a case-by-case basis.
If MoEngage does not support the 100 dp for a device/OEM, the 64 dp custom push notification will be rendered

For best results in image rendering, follow these guidelines for all notifications:

Maintain an Image Aspect Ratio of ~2:1.
Cropping is minimal when the image is close to this aspect ratio. However, you might notice some cropping on a few devices despite images following this aspect ratio. This is because of the following reasons:
The varying device sizes in Android.
Some OEMs add further customizations on top. For eg: In RedMi devices, additional padding is added around push notifications which leads to further cropping of the Push notification & the image.
Create images such that the content is center aligned.
This would ensure that the main content doesn't get truncated even if some cropping is happening around the margins.

Users Receive Stylized Push Notifications Without Background Color

Some users received the Push notification with HTML content but without the background color. The following are the possible reasons for this issue:

Whenever you configure a Push template notification with:

HTML text (meaning, you have either set the text as bold, italic, underlined, strike-through, or added some text color) and
Background color
Image

The SDK renders the notification in the following sequence:

Renders a basic push notification with HTML text fields and app icon.
Then, the SDK tries to draw the custom layout containing the background color. If you configure an image, SDK will try to download the image in parallel.

Since SDK only gets ~10 secs to render the entire notification, sometimes due to poor Internet connectivity or other network issues, the background rendering or image rendering or both might fail. If both fail, this would result in showing a Push notification with only the stylized text and no background color.

Impact of Background Color Rendering Failure
If you set your text color as white, users see a blank notification as shown below if their device theme is set as light mode:


If you set your text color as black, users see a blank notification as shown below if their device theme is set as dark mode:



So, MoEngage suggests that:

Wherever possible, use text colors that contrast with light and dark backgrounds.
While creating campaigns on the MoEngage dashboard, check the preview in both dark and light modes to make sure the notification looks fine in both modes.
Color Inversion in Dark Mode (Device-Specific Issue)

Some colors get inverted in dark mode when a Stylized Push is sent. This has been observed only on a few Oppo devices running on Android 10. This happens because of a bug with ColorOS (an operating system created by OPPO), which is beyond the scope of MoEngage.

Personalization Failure

Consider a scenario where you have personalized both the template and backup notifications but not added the personalization fallback. In this situation, if the personalization fails for either the template or backup, the notification will not be sent to any users. This is because template and backup are considered to be part of one payload and since personalization fallback is not present, MoEngage won't have any alternate message to send to the user in case of failure. 

To avoid this issue, make sure that you add a personalization backup to your messages. For more information on personalization failure, refer to Common Personalization Errors and FAQs."

Reasons for Push Token Drop and how to fix it (Android)
What is a token drop?

Token drop is a situation or case where the MoEngage Platform does not have push tokens for all the users of your application. Say your application is installed by 100 new users every day but there are tokens for only 60 users on the MoEngage Platform, this is regarded as a 40% token drop.

Why is it important to fix it?

To send out a push notification to your end-users push token is required. Without a push-token push cannot be sent. Hence to keep your users engaged it is very important to fix the token drop.
Why does token drop occur?
Token drop can happen because of various reasons:

Poor/No Internet connectivity which results in Firebase SDK not generating the token.
Play services version mismatch, play services version on the device isn't compatible with the Firebase version used in the application
Application has some internal check/flag based on which they decide whether to pass the token to the MoEngage SDK and during the token generation that flag is disabled hence token isn't passed to MoEngage SDK.
Integration Error, push token is not being passed to the MoEngage SDK.

How to Resolve a Push Token Drop in iOS

 

What Is a Token Drop?

A token drop is a situation or case where the MoEngage platform does not have Push tokens for all the users of your application. For example, your application is installed by 100 new users every day but there are tokens for only 60 users on the MoEngage platform, this is regarded as a 40% token drop.

Why Should You Resolve a Token Drop?

To send out a Push notification to your end-users, a Push token is required. Without it, you cannot send a Push notification. Hence, it is very important to resolve the token drop to keep your users engaged.

Why Does a Token Drop Occur?

A token drop can happen because of various reasons: 

Token not passed to MoEngage SDK: If the implementation of Push notification is not done correctly.
Push permission not granted by the user: If the user opts for Don't Allow on asking for Push notification permission.


Network connectivity: If the device is connected to a slow network connection or not connected to any network. This is a rare reason for token drop.
Integration error: A Push token is not passed to the MoEngage SDK.
How to Resolve a Token Drop?
First, check if the Push Notification is correctly implemented. For more information, refer to implementation of Push Notifcations. Ensure that you register your app for Push notifications correctly. Check if you are getting the device token while trying to register for Remote Notification and the same is sent to the MoEngage SDK correctly.
Test by sending a test campaign targetting the particular device. If an error is received, check for the error description in Common Push Errors.

If the test campaign is sent successfully but the notification is not received on the device, check if notification settings for the app are disabled.


If you still cannot identify the reason or need further assistance, contact the MoEngage Support team.

To contact the MoEngage Support team, you can raise a ticket through the Support Web Form within the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer here."

Under Project Settings, select Cloud Messaging. You will see 2 keys mentioned in there. 
The legacy server key is what you might be using on the MoEngage Dashboard, and you are not able to send notifications. 
Pick up the Server key (which is the longer one), and update it under the Server key in MoEngage Dashboard in Settings -> Channels -> Push  Settings-> Mobile Push.

Note: The key quoted below is just a sample key. You need to use your Server key there.

Once you update the Server key, create a campaign on the dashboard and check if you receive push notifications on your mobile app."

Why Are Android Users Receiving Blank Notifications?

This issue occurs mostly because the Silent Push Notifications that MoEngage sends to track device uninstalls are not appropriately handled on the App side for cases when the App (not MoEngage) has the Notification Display control.

To ensure if that's the case, test silent push notification as mentioned here. When testing if the silent push notification is visible as a blank push notification, disable the Uninstall Tracking from the MoEngage dashboard at Settings > Analytics and Data >  Uninstall tracking and turn the Android Uninstall Tracking toggle off.

The second step is to handle Silent Push Notification as mentioned here. After you handle it and ensure that all your users are on (or above) the app version on which the change has been implemented, turn the Android Uninstall Tracking toggle on again by navigating to Settings > Analytics and Data >  Uninstall tracking in the MoEngage Dashboard.

Another reason why this happens is when your app is receiving notifications from multiple servers or providers or in-house notification services. Your users will receive blank notifications if the push received from different servers is not handled correctly. Make sure that the app does not try to show a notification if the notification is from MoEngage.

If the problem persists, contact the MoEngage Support team.

To contact the MoEngage Support team, you can raise a ticket through the Support Web Form within the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer here."

MismatchsenderId: How can I send push notifications?

MismatchsenderId can happen while sending the push notifications primarily due to a conflict between the private key uploaded on MoEngage dashboard and google-services.json file in the Android project. Kindly ensure you use the private key and the json file from the same project.

 

Incorrect google-services.json file

Every Firebase project will have a Project ID. There are couple of things to check for correct json file.

This Project ID should be same in the google-services.json file that is present in your Android app.

 

 

Package name in your manifest file also should match the package name in the google-services.json file 

 

Incorrect private key on MoEngage Dashboard

To verify if you have uploaded the right private key, the project_id in the private key should match with the Firebase Project ID. 

You can open the private key json file in any text editor and it will have the project_id key with value as your project ID.

 

Private key is usually generated from service accounts page, don't generate a new key if you already have a key."

Troubleshooting and FAQs - Mobile Push
Why Are End Users Not Receiving Push Notifications?

Some end users are not receiving the notifications sent by MoEngage customers. The notifications are successfully sent to Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), but they are not delivered to the end users.

The probable reasons for this issue are as follows:

Users can block notifications at the operating system (OS) level: Operating systems allow users to block the notification for a particular app. The problem with this implementation is that GCM does not invalidate the token nor does it inform the app server about this temporary de-activation. Also, some battery-saving apps force-stop the running apps, which does not deliver notifications to the user’s device.
Device-specific issues: Some devices do not receive notifications when apps are not running either in the foreground or background. The device manufacturers are resolving this issue in new updates but the problem persists in older versions. For Lenovo 6000 series, the failure rate is around 98%–99% that is, MoEngage can only deliver to 1 out of 100 devices.
Users are not connected to GCM due to network issues: A lot of customers are not connected to the Internet for a long time and hence GCM cannot deliver notifications to them as well as cannot mark them inactive. GCM works by maintaining an idle socket connection from an Android device to Google's servers. To make sure that the connection remains active, Android will send a heartbeat every 28 minutes (which has recently changed to a dynamic value based on Google I/O 16) on a mobile connection and every 15 minutes on Wifi. If this heartbeat is not received, the connection is considered broken and Google attempts to re-establish it.


Google suggested that nearly 15% of users are not connected to GCM in general and hence might not receive notifications at the right time. This in turn results in the following problems:

Delay in messages
Non-delivery in case the user is still out of network
Time to Live (TTL) expires before notification delivery: It might so happen that GCM was not able to connect with the device within the TTL time hence GCM won’t deliver the notification if the TTL is expired at the time of delivery.
Gap from GCM in marking token as in-active: There is a gap between the time device is uninstalled and GCM marking the device as inactive. Google documentation states: “Note that it might take a while for the registration token to be completely removed from GCM. Thus it is possible that messages sent to GCM  get a valid message ID as a response, even though the message will not be delivered to the client app.”  As a result, MoEngage might successfully send the notification to GCM without knowing the install status of the app on the user's device but the message won’t be delivered.
Other issues: Many times in corporate setups, the outer firewall rejects the incoming packets due to security settings. Check another blog here which mentions a similar problem and suggested solution.
Push Benchmark Report

The following is the benchmark report for Push campaigns that can help you understand the trend for the standard metrics such as Delivery rate, Click-through rate (CTR), and conversion rate (CVR):

info	

Information


Delivery Rate benchmarks for iOS in this report do not consider impression tracking and opt-in status of the device.

The image above shows the data from Q3'2020 [1st Jul 2020 - 30th Sep 2020]. Last updated on 2nd Nov 2020.

MoEngage not only tracks sent numbers but also captures the notification impressions from clients' devices. MoEngage executed an analysis across our clients and divided the analysis into the following themes:

User Activity: To understand if there is a correlation between the user activity (how recently your user visited your app) and notification deliverability
User Device: To understand if there is a correlation between device model (mobile device used by your users) and notification deliverability
User Activity

Of all notifications sent to All Users and successfully accepted by GCM, many notifications are not actually delivered to users. The following image shows the break-up of notifications that were successfully sent but not received by the end users.

Though MoEngage could not establish direct causality, there is a high correlation here. As the duration of inactivity increases, reachability decreases that is, GCM might not be able to reach and deliver notifications to these users.

MoEngage executed the same analysis for users who received these notifications which also indicated that recency increases reachability.

User Devices
info	

Information

The following analysis covers the Android platform. After MoEngage hands over notifications to GCM servers and they successfully accept the message for a particular user, MoEngage servers don’t have the visibility on the reasons why the message was not delivered. Hence the following reasons are just hypotheses that MoEngage cannot validate in the absence of data.

Most of the time, some device models do not receive notifications sent by MoEngage customers. MoEngage got this hypothesis after executing the numbers across multiple campaigns for a few clients.

In Lenovo A6020 and Lenovo A6000, the failure rates were high around 98%-99%.
Micromax also exhibited high failure rates around 90-95% for its canvas series.
ASUS Z00AD, Z010D,  Z008D, Z00UD, and Z00LD devices also had delivery rates lesser than 4%.
Vivo devices (namely Y11, Y15S, Y27L, Y28, Y57L, and V1) with Iris X8 and Iris Fuel 50 also have very low delivery rates ranging from 2-3%.
In Motorola phones, the doze mode detects when your device is not in use and it will automatically go into a deep sleep state which saves your battery. App Standby reduces the battery drain of your phone by changing your seldom-used apps into a reduced activity state which then hampers the notification delivery.
Some end users are also facing problems on Android Marshmallow devices because of battery optimization introduced by Google with Android M that is, not delivering the notification when the device is idle.

All these devices have a substantial share (particulars vary based on genre and demographics of client apps) of the installed customer base and hence lowering the delivery rate as a whole.

Why Are Users Receiving a Simple Text Push Instead of a Rich Push Notification?

Sometimes, if you configured a rich Push notification (that is, added an image, GIF, or video), some end users received only a text notification instead of the rich content. The following are the possible reasons for this issue:

The image size was too big and hence it failed to download while rendering the notification. The recommended image size is 25 KB with a 2:1 aspect ratio.
The image was well under the recommended guidelines (that is, <= 25 KB), but still it failed. This could happen because of slow Internet issues on the user's device. In such cases, the text would get loaded but the image might still fail."

Web Push Campaigns within 60 minutes

Web push notifications are a powerful tool that can be leveraged to help solve the issues of Cart Abandonment and User Drop-offs. With MoEngage, you can set up these web push notifications to guide the users back to their cart, or to the page where they dropped off from.

Our customers have made the most out of our behavior-based triggers and experienced great results with campaign click-through rates as high as 45%.

Setup Search/View/Cart Abandonment Web Push Campaigns within 60 minutes

To set up a Web Push campaign, you must:

Step 1: Integrate Web Push on your website

You can configure Web Push Settings on your MoEngage dashboard and integrate Web SDK on your website by following the integration docs. This would take less than 30 minutes and you will start seeing web user events on the dashboard.

Step 2: Setup Web Push Trigger Notifications
Navigate to MoEngage > Engage > Create Campaign > Push and click on Event Triggered.
Select the trigger action as shown in the below screenshot.
The example shows a view abandonment campaign for the ""shoes"" category where a user who viewed a webpage with ""URL contains shoes"" AND did not view a webpage with ""URL contains success"" - basically did not complete the purchase.
Set the trigger time per your requirement. For instance, 30 minutes. 

Step 3: Setup Web Push Notification Messaging

Enter the Notification Title and Message and personalize the Redirect URL by entering ""@"" and selecting ""URL"" under Event Attributes as described:

 

Step 4: Schedule Your Campaign

After modifying the content, you can schedule when you want it to go live. Moreover, you can add a few conversion goals to it that will help you determine the success of your campaign. 

You have now successfully created this campaign and this will help you target users who viewed a product but did not complete the purchase."

Web Push Permission and Reachability
Overview - Push Permission

Push notifications permission is an app-level permission that your app gets on a user's device. This permission is required to display push notifications on users' notification trays. If this permission is turned off, the notifications that you send will not be visible to the user; they will get delivered in the background to your app silently. 

How Does Push Permission Work?

Permission for Web push depends on the browser and the device's operating system (OS). There are a few commonalities in the behavior of most of the browsers:

By default, the website cannot send notifications until the user grants permission.
The user must grant permission to the website by:

Accepting permission on a dialog box provided by the browser
Enabling permission from the browser notification settings for the website
If the user grants permission, the app can send notifications to the user.
If the user does not grant permission, the app cannot send notifications to the user.
The behavior of the dialog box differs depending on the browser.
Browser	Behavior on clicking “Allow” (or equivalent action)	Behavior on clicking “Block” (or equivalent action)	Behavior on Ignoring the Dialog Box
Chrome, Opera	Permission is granted to the website and it can send notifications.	Permission is denied to the website and it cannot send notifications.
The website cannot also ask for permission through the dialog box again.	Permission is denied to the website and it cannot send notifications.
The website can ask for permission through the dialog box again.
Safari, Edge, Firefox	Permission is granted to the website and will be able to send notifications.	Permission is denied to the website and it cannot send notifications.
The website cannot also ask for permission through the dialog box again.	Permission is denied to the website and it cannot send notifications.
The website cannot also ask for permission through the dialog box again.
Tracking Push Permissions

From September 9, 2024 onwards, you will be able to track Push permission for a user from the Reachability Push Web attribute. 

Tracking Push Permission Status at a User Level

This attribute will have the following values:

Value	Description
201 - Reachable and opted in	This applies to all users who have a valid push token and are opted-in from at least one browser.
202 - Not reachable due to opt-out	This applies to all users who have opted out from all browsers where they had a valid push token.
200 - Reachable and opt-in status unknown	This applies to all users who have not yet opened the website after the tracking changes are released and have a valid push token.

 

info	

Information

Unlike Android and iOS, web push notifications generate push tokens only when the user allows the browser to send push notifications.
A user with the status '202—Not reachable due to opt-out' has a device where they opted in first and then opted out while still having a valid push token.
A new Web device, by default, has a reachability status of '404—Any user who is not reachable due to Push ID not found'.

You can query the Reachability Push Web attribute using a segmentation query to get counts of each of these users independently by navigating to Segment > Create Segment on the MoEngage Dashboard.

Tracking Changes in Push Permission

The following are the events for Web Push reachability:

Name	Description	Platform
Subscribed to Push	Tracked when a user subscribes to Push Notifications.	Web
Unsubscribed to Push	Tracked when a user directly unsubscribes from Push Notifications.	Web
Track Push Permissions Trends Over Time

The Reachability Dashboard at MoEngage shows you the reachability trends of all users who opted in to receive your Push notifications and those who have not. You can access the Reachability Dashboard by navigating to Dashboards > Reachability.

For more information, refer to Push Reachability Dashboard.

Opt-In Methods

You can configure the Web Push Opt-In information in this section. Opt-In refers to how push permission is sought from the users on your webpage. For more information, refer to Configure Web Push Settings."

Conversion Goals

You can add conversion goals to track the business metrics for your campaigns. You can track up to five conversion goals. You can choose any app event as a conversion goal activity and set more than one conversion goal. The first goal will be treated as a primary goal.

For example, if you want to track the number of customers who've purchased an iPhone after your campaign was sent. (Event - purchase event, Product - iPhone). Your conversion goal set-up might look similar to the image shown below with the following details:

Goal Name - iPhonePurchase 
App Event you wish to track- Made Purchase
Event Attribute/Property - product is event attribute/property 
Value of Event Attribute/Property - iPhone

With multiple conversion goals, you can track more than one business metric or visualize a funnel for your user actions. For example, if you want to check the following, you can do so with multiple conversion goals.

How many users have viewed the product page?
How many of them added that product to the cart?
How many of them made a successful order?

Website Push For AMP

You can send Web Push notifications to users who opt-in for web push notifications on web pages built using the AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) framework with MoEngage. Since AMP is dedicated to optimizing the web experience for the mobile user, like faster page loading, there are a few framework-enforced restrictions, such as not running third-party scripts on AMP pages.

Moreover, the integration for AMP pages is different from the regular Web Push integration with MoEngage SDK. For more information, refer to AMP Web Push Integration. Please note that this is available only for HTTPS websites.

Integration Essentials

AMP is supported on all the major browsers on Android and iOS (refer to the complete list here). However, users can only subscribe to Web Push notifications for AMP pages on Android devices. 

Setting up an AMP integration is enabled by default on your MoEngage account. You can choose to add the AMP integration to an already existing Web Push integration or have the stand-alone AMP integration.

This integration enables the following:

Ability to opt-in for Web Push on AMP pages
Ability to customize the Web Push opt-in button display
Ability for end-users to opt-out from Web Push after they opt-in
Ability to deliver a Web Push to subscribed users. The Web Push can be personalized and can include rich features like display images, action buttons, etc.
You can personalize your Web Push content using auxiliary data by selecting the auxiliary data attributes in the personalization editor. For more information, refer to Personalize Campaign Content Using Auxiliary Data.
Ability to track Web Push impressions and user actions (button click, notification click).
Ability to track system events and all custom events.
How to Target AMP Web Push Subscribers?

Once you have completed the AMP for Web Push Integration, the visitors of your published AMP pages can opt-in for Web Push by clicking on the Subscription widget (button).

 

Identifying Web Push Subscriptions from AMP pages

When subscribed successfully, the Subscribed to Web Push event for the user is triggered automatically. You can view these users by using the User behavior segmentation filter.

Filter users by using the Has Executed event and setting it to Subscribed to Web Push and setting the frequency and time. 




 

To identify the number of users who have subscribed on AMP pages, filter users who have executed the event Subscribed to Web Push with isAMP attribute as True. 

info	

Note

If a user is already subscribed on non-AMP pages and then navigates to an AMP page, they will be automatically shown as Subscribed to AMP. 

 
Sending Web Push to subscribers from AMP Pages

To send a Web Push notification to your users:

Create a push campaign and select Web as one of the target platforms. 
You can target users who have subscribed to Web Push from APM pages by: 
Using the All Users segment as the target audience.
Creating a custom segment of identified users as shown here. 
Create the message you want to send and schedule your campaign accordingly. To know more about Web Push campaigns, go through this page."

Campaigns and Channels 
Web Push 
FAQs - Web Push
Why Do CTRs Go Over 100% of the Total Number of Impressions?
Problem

Some Push campaigns have Click-Through Rates (CTRs) over 100%, which appears incorrect and raises doubts about accuracy.

Cause

The following are the reasons for high CTR:

When the SDK fails to track impressions for iOS, it leads to a count of zero, even though clicks are still recorded. This can inflate the overall CTR if Android counts are coming from inbox.
For more information, refer to Why Are Push Campaign Impressions Not Tracked on iOS Devices?
When sticky push notifications allow users to click multiple times, specifically for small targeted user bases, leading to a higher number of clicks than impressions.
For more information, refer to the Advanced tab in Push Templates.
When app inbox is enabled allowing end users to click on old notifications from the app's inbox, resulting in multiple clicks being registered for a single user.
For more information, refer to Notification Center for Android and iOS Notification Center for iOS.
In some rare instances, integration issues with self-handled push notifications can occasionally cause duplicate click callbacks to be sent, leading to an increase in the CTR.
For more information, refer to Push Handled by Application for Android and Push Display Handled by Application for iOS.
Explanation
To calculate CTR, use the formula: CTR = (Total Clicks / Total Impressions) * 100.
MoEngage tracks iOS campaign impressions differently based on the Show iOS Impressions Toggle.

When you turn the toggle off, sent messages are counted as impressions. 
When you turn the toggle on, the actual impression count is based on the Notification Received iOS event.
Example

For instance, if you have 2000 impressions on your campaign, the reported CTR might be higher than 2,000."

FAQs - Web Push
Chrome app level permission behavior

This article details the drop in aggregate web push subscribers issue observed starting March 2023.

What is it?

Web push subscribers were observed to be going down for most of the websites, including websites that do not have MoEngage SDK integration starting from Feb-Mar 2023.

The following was observed:

Drop in web push subscriber count.

Push tokens are sometimes marked ""Not Registered"" by FCM incorrectly, leading to increased sending failures.

A high volume of ""Unsubscribed to web push"" events on specific dates.

Why is this happening?

It has been reported by multiple other websites as well.

As a part of the Chromium 109.0.5414.22 Release, there was a change related to app-level permission.

This means that if the Chrome browser does not have permission on the user's device to send notifications (App-level permission), even if the users accept permission on the website (site-level permission), the browser will invalidate the push token after a 3-day grace period.

What is the user behavior now on the new system?

For new users to your website, if the App-level permission is turned off, it will block the ""Hard ask"" from being displayed to give site-level permission.

For existing users with site-level permission, if the user opens the site after app-level permission is turned off, the browser will invalidate the push token after a 3-day grace period.

If the user gets back on the site again after three days, the following will happen:

MoEngage Web SDK will trigger the ""Unsubscribed to web push"" event.

MoEngage Web SDK will remove the Web Push token for that user.

Chrome will set the browser permission is set to ""Ask"" or ""Blocked"".

If the user does not return to the site after three days, and you attempt a notification to this device, you may get a ""Not registered"" failure. There is no specific documentation for this behavior in Chromium of FCM documentation, and sometimes it may take longer for ""not registered"" failure to appear for such cases. Till this happens, the notification will be marked as successfully sent and delivered for this customer.

At this point, Chrome does not allow a website to read Chrome's app-level permission; hence MoEngage cannot proactively:

Reset the site-level permission

Nudge the user to enable app-level permission

Track device level permission as a reason to mark unsubscription reason

Show soft-ask now

Is this rolled out for my users?

The impact depends on how many of your users are on the new system:

They must be on Chrome 110 and above.
This is an incremental rollout; even for users on the latest Chrome version, this change may have yet to be rolled out, depending on their geography.
So far, we have seen that this impacts different accounts differently, and there are release dates where Chrome rolls out this change for a chunk of users. We have observed one or more ""Peak instances"" for accounts where many unsubscribers were seen on that day, and thus, the overall unsubscription rate increased slightly.

The typical day-wise split of unsubscriptions for any account in the last six months is shown below. Note that this data may vary from account to account.

What is the impact?

These are only general observations, and the account-to-account behavior may differ.

Web push subscribers would drop roughly 30% after the ""Peak instance(s)"".

For push campaigns for the web platform only, the sent count and impression count may decrease; the delivery rate will roughly remain the same.

Since this only affects the devices where the app-level permission is turned off, this only affects users who could not see notifications in the first place; this does not affect the engagement you receive from the campaigns. You may observe your CTR go up.

This does not affect push reachability for Android or iOS platforms or tracking of user data on the web.

We have reached out to the Chromium developer team regarding this change. They are still observing the feature, have seen issues with the recent release, and will be making changes to it from now on. This will be an iterative change from the Chromium team, and you may see more changes concerning how site-level and app-level permission work in tandem."

FAQs - Web Push
How to migrate Web Push Subscribers from other platforms to MoEngage
Objective

Migrate web push subscriber base from other platforms to MoEngage and target these users via campaigns created on MoEngage.

Steps to be carried out

1) Integrate MoEngage SDK with your website. Please refer to the integration document for steps to integrate the SDK.

2) Create campaigns targeting 'All Users' in the previous vendor platform and redirect the users onto your website. The objective of this step is to register the MoEngage Service Worker on the user's device which is required to show WebPush Notifications from campaigns created on the MoEngage Platform. Keep targeting the user until the majority of the existing users have been registered on MoEngage. You can find the web push subscriber count on the key metrics page on MoEngage.

3) If a user has already subscribed to receive web push notifications from your website, the opt-in permission would not be shown to the user. In the backend, the following steps would occur:
i) Registering of the MoEngage Service Worker
ii) Generation of a push token for this user.
iii) Capture device details such as Browser type, Browser version, and so on. 

4) Users will now be able to receive Push Notifications from campaigns created on MoEngage Dashboard. 

FAQs

Q: What if the subscribed users do not visit the website after integrating the MoEngage SDK? Will they be reachable via Web Push Campaigns? 

Ans:  If the users do not visit the website after the MoEngage SDK is integrated, the MoEngage service worker would not be registered on their device. Hence users will not receive the web push notification as the older service worker (from the previous vendor) may be following a different payload structure and it may not support the MoEngage payload structure. Even if the notification is shown to the user, MoEngage will not be able to track impressions in this case."

FAQs - Web Push
""Quieter permissions"" for Web Push Chrome Subscription

Chrome has announced the introduction of Quieter permissions for web push subscriptions to address the common user complaint that many websites request notification permission on the first visit rather than at contextually relevant moments in the user’s journey which inadvertently gives a bad user experience. 

From chrome version 80 onwards, chrome will not show interruptive web push opt-in permission on the first-page load(web visit), instead, it will block it by default which the users can override if required. This is termed Quieter permissions, and this will be available on both Desktop and mobile versions of the browser. Below is an example of how it works. 
 
 
 
Chrome version 80 will be released publicly on 4th Feb 2020, and with it, chrome users will have the option to enable quieter permissions from the browser settings section. In the cases mentioned below, the quieter permissions will be enabled by default 
For users who repeatedly block the notifications across the websites on their chrome browser 
For websites that have very low opt-in rates across the chrome browser platform

So, potentially if you are using a one-step opt-in for the web push subscription, from 4th Feb 2020 onwards you could see a significant dip in new subscriptions. To avoid such a scenario please go to your  Web Push settings and move to the 2step op-tin or self-handled opt-in. Both a 2-step opt-in or a self-handled contextual opt-in should provide the required context for the notification permission ask and make it relevant for the user. Click here to know the step by step to change the opt-in method."

FAQs - Web Push
I see a difference between the number of web push notifications Successfully Sent and the Impressions. What could be the possible reasons?

The number of web push notifications that MoEngage successfully passes to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is what you see as Successfully Sent.

Impressions are the number of notifications that reach the user.

There may be instances when Impressions are lower than Successfully Sent.

This drop-off can be attributed to the following factors.

1) User didn't come online till the time of notification expiry
2) Browser is not running on the user's device
3) Failure in communication between FCM-Browser-OS
4) User has turned off notifications on his/her device

What is the allowed character limit for title and message in web push notifications?
Character Limits

The length of notification title and message depends on a number of factors including screen size, width, and input language. It may vary from device to device.

The total permissible data limit is 4 KB. If the number of characters exceeds the limit suited for a device type, the title/message may appear trimmed (followed by ...) when delivered on that device.

Example

Here's an example of how a trimmed title/message may appear on Mac.

The character limits are lower for a rich push that contains an image. Hence, copywriting plays a vital role, along with the timing and relevance of the content."

FAQs - Web Push
What are the ideal image sizes for browser push notifications?

The image sizes vary depending on your targeting. Here are the ideal image sizes as well as aspect ratios for mobile and desktop targeting.

For Desktop - Image should be at least 360px (width) by 180px (height) with an aspect ratio of 2:1

For Mobile - Image should be at least 720px (width) by 240px (height) with an aspect ratio of 3:1 

Larger images will be downsized and smaller images will be stretched depending on the size of the container.

For targeting Mobile and desktop users with different images within the same campaign, we recommend creating different locales for mobile and desktop users. Now, while setting up the web campaigns you would get options to use different images for each locale that you have set up. 

For example, You can set up a locale with ""Web Push Subscription Status is True AND Mobile User is True"" as a locale for your Mobile users and while creating the campaign choose an image with a 3:1 aspect ratio within the message for the created locale."

How to Test a Notification Without User Details on Google Chrome?

If you are not sending user details to MoEngage, to identify and target the user, it's hard to test a push notification before actually sending it. You can target a user with push token information. Perform the following steps to get a push token:

Get a Push Token
Visit your HTTPS site on which you have subscribed for push notifications. In the case of an HTTP site, you must visit the actual HTTPS site under which you have subscribed.
In the website window, right-click the browser and go to Inspect -> Application -> Local Storage.
Click the domain that belongs to you. In the right pane, you will find the push token information under moe_push_storage or MOE_PUSH_TOKEN.
Double-click the value section of this data to copy it. The following images show what that information looks like.
Test the Campaign

Now that you have a push token, you can find the test campaign section while creating the campaign.

Go to step 2 ""Content"" in the Push campaign.
In the Test Campaign section, from the Select Option drop-down list, select ""Device push token"".
In the Type something here field, paste the push token information you just copied above.
Click Test to target your browser with a push token.

If you cannot see a notification after following the steps above, contact the MoEngage Support team.

To contact the MoEngage Support team, you can raise a ticket through the Support Web Form within the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer here."

IP Addresses and Domains
IP Addresses

Your business's IP address is essential in email marketing. If your system requires IP whitelisting, refer here.

Importance of IP Address in Email Marketing

Email service providers assign an ""IP reputation"" to anyone sending large numbers of emails. IP Reputation (good or bad) is built over time depending on the marketers’ actions using this IP. If an email marketer has a good IP reputation with email service providers, they are more likely to deliver your emails to the inboxes of your list recipients. If you have a poor IP reputation, your marketing emails can end up in the spam folder or be blocked entirely from delivery.

Dedicated and Shared IPs
Dedicated IPs	Shared IPs
Are reserved only for a particular sender. The benefit of using such IPs is that you have full control over that IP's reputation.	Are common between multiple senders. Because the IPs are shared, the performance of each of the senders has an impact on the IP's reputation.
Require warm-up and ramp-up, and a consistent sending pattern to maintain the IP reputation.	Do not require IP warm-up, but domain warm-up will be required if you want to send emails from a new domain.
Are suited for senders with high volumes and consistent sending patterns.	Are suited for senders with lower volumes and infrequent sending patterns.
Number of IPs Required

The number of IPs required largely depends on the peak volume per day, sending frequency, audience quality, and target region. If you do not know your peak sending volume or do not have any sending patterns in place, you can query the number of email-subscribed users in your account. That can be your peak volume. The following is our recommendation:

Daily Email Volume	Number of IPs
1M	1
1M - 3M	2
> 3 M	a tailored solution from MoEngage
Allocation of IPs by MoEngage

MoEngage allocates dedicated IPs to our customers using MoEngage Email Delivery services. Your MoEngage email deliverability consultant (EDC) will analyze your volume, sending pattern, and audience distribution and allocate the IPs as required. If you are using your own email connector, you will need to check with your vendor.

MoEngage does not provide pre-warmed IPs. We ramp up each sender from scratch using their own emails. The only exception to this is if you have a dedicated SendGrid IP that is already warmed up. In such cases, the same can be migrated to your MoEngage account, and you can start your campaigns.

Domains

An email domain is the unique identifier that appears after the “@” symbol in an email address. It represents the online location where an organization’s email is hosted. For example, in the email address “example@moengage.com,” the email domain is “moengage.com.” The email domain plays an important role in routing emails to the correct mail servers.

Importance of Domains in Email Marketing
Branding: Using a custom email domain can enhance your brand identity and present a more professional image to recipients. It can add credibility and trustworthiness to your email communications.
Email deliverability: Having your own email domain can improve email deliverability. Some email service providers prioritize emails from custom domains, increasing the chances of your emails landing in inbox.
Enhanced security: With a custom email domain, you have better control over security measures, such as implementing advanced spam filters, encryption protocols, and multi-factor authentication. This helps protect your email communications and sensitive information from unauthorized access.
Customization and flexibility: An email domain gives you the flexibility to create multiple email addresses for different purposes or departments within your organization. For instance, you can have info@business.com for general inquiries and support@business.com for customer support. This customization improves organizational efficiency and helps manage email correspondence effectively.
Difference Between a Domain, Subdomain, and From Address
Example 1

If your website is: https://www.moengage.com/

Domain: moengage.com
Sub-domain: anything.moengage.com
From address: anything@anything.moengage.com
Example 2

If the emails are sent from: MoEngage Inc <support@moengage.com>

Sender Name: MoEngage Inc
From address: support@moengage.com
From domain: moengage.com
Example 3

If the emails are sent from: MoEngage <info@alerts.moengage.com>

Sender Name: MoEngage
From address: info@alerts.moengage.com
From domain: alerts.moengage.com
""alerts.moengage.com"" is a sub-domain of ""moengage.com""
Using Sub-Domain for Email Campaigns

You can use your root domain to send transactional emails. However, it is a good practice to use a sub-domain for all other types of emails. Promotional emails have a higher potential to impact the reputation of the domain from which they are sent. This has a direct correlation with deliverability and inbox placement of the emails sent from that domain. If you send both transactional and promotional emails from the same domain, poor performance of your promotional campaign can impact the performance of your transactional emails.

Number of Domains Required

The number of domains required largely depends on the peak volume per day, sending frequency, and use cases. However, we recommend a minimum of two sub-domains: one for the transactional emails and one for all other mailing needs.

Sender	Frequency of Sending	Email Volume	Domain Recommendation
A	NA	< 10K/day	
One sub-domain for one-time, periodic, event-triggered ,and Flow campaigns
One sub-domain for transactional campaigns

B	1/month or less	NA	
One sub-domain for one-time, periodic, event-triggered, and Flow campaigns
One sub-domain for transactional campaigns

C	4/month or more	> 100K/day	
One sub-domain for one-time and periodic campaigns
One sub-domain for event-triggered and Flow campaigns
One sub-domain for transactional campaigns"

Email Authentication Basics
What is Email Authentication?

Email authentication is a process used to verify the authenticity and integrity of an email message or sender. It helps to prevent email spoofing, phishing, and other forms of email fraud by confirming that the message is sent from the claimed sender and has not been tampered with during transmission.

ISPs like Gmail and Yahoo have mandated the use of authentication methods like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC as a part of their latest deliverability guidelines. These methods were always recommended, and they help protect users from unsolicited, spam, and fraudulent emails. Compliance with these will have a direct impact on the effectiveness and deliverability of email campaigns.

 

What are SPF, DKIM, and DMARC?

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are authentication methods that brands can implement to increase the trustworthiness of their email communications and reduce the risk of email scams and impersonation attacks.

Sender Policy Framework (SPF): SPF allows domain owners to publish a list of authorized IPs that are allowed to send emails on behalf of their domain. When an email is received, the recipient's mail server checks the SPF records in the domain's DNS to verify if the sending IP in the email request is authorized to send emails for that domain.
DKIM uses a digital signature that is added to the email header to verify that the message has not been tampered with. The sender's domain signs the email with a private key, and the recipient's mail server uses the public key stored in the DNS records to validate the signature.
Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC): DMARC is an email authentication policy framework that builds on SPF and DKIM. It allows domain owners to specify how their emails should be handled if they fail authentication checks. DMARC provides instructions to receiving mail servers on how to handle emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks, such as marking them as spam or rejecting them. Moreover, DMARC allows for reports to be sent to the admin to identify where the unauthenticated emails are sent from.

If you are on a MoEngage email, we share these records with you in the form of DNS records for them to be updated in your Domain Name Server (DNS) as part of your onboarding.



What are DNS Records?

DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it acts as a directory for the internet. It translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing computers to locate and communicate with each other. DNS records are a set of instructions that tell servers how to handle different aspects of your domain.

There are three different types of DNS records that MoEngage shares with you at the time of onboarding.

For Domain and IP Authentication
SPF (Record type: CNAME) for authentication
DKIM (Record type: CNAME) for authentication
Domain lookup for dedicated IP (Record type: A)
DMARC (Record type: TXT)


DNS records for URL branding

DNS Link branding (Record type: CNAME)


DNS record to access your Domain Reputation in Google Postmaster
Google Postmaster

An example of what these records look like is attached below: 





How do I know if these are set for my domains or not?

You can send a test email to your Gmail address and check if your authentication is up to date based on the screenshot below. Click on the 3-dot menu on the top right and click on ""Show Original"".

Search for ""Received: from"" and look for the following

The Received from domain about your IP should be the subdomain of your domain.
The ""Authentication-Results:"" should show dkim=pass, spf=pass, and dmarc=pass.

Hover over the images and links in the email and the link domain shown at the bottom left should be the subdomain of your domain.




If these don't match, what do I do? 

Reach out to your MoEngage Customer Success Manager and get the exact records that need to be set up in your DNS.


Where do I update them?

You will need to know who your domain registrar is. You can find the exact steps based on the most common providers below. If you don't have the required access, you can share these details with your IT admin and they can help you in setting these up.

Email 
Getting Started with Email
Configure Email Channel

This article provides information about various tabs in Email settings and also explains the procedure to configure your email channel. Follow the below steps to access the email settings:

Login to MoEngage Dashboard.
Navigate to Settings on the left-side panel.
Under Channels, click Email.
Overview Tab

The Overview tab helps the user identify whether the senders configured are in MoEngage or App Marketplace. The Overview tab displays the number of senders configured in Moengage and App Marketplace separately. This tab contains the following two options:

Setup MoEngage email sender.
Under this option, you can view the number of senders configured via MoEngage delivery. Clicking View details redirects you to the Sender Configuration tab. If you are using MoEngage as your ESP this is where you will find your settings. 
Setup other email sender.
Under this option, you can view the number of senders configured via Moengage App Marketplace. Clicking View details redirects you to the App Marketplace. If you have configured your own ESP (ie other email senders), you will find them under App Marketplace.

Sender Configuration Tab

This tab helps you to configure the senders in MoEngage delivery. You can add any number of senders here. Follow the below steps to add a sender.


Click Add Sender on the top-right corner of the screen.
In the following Warning pop-up that appears, click Continue.
In the following Add sender page, click on any sender you want to configure.


Refer to the following articles for detailed steps to know how MoEngage configures each Email service provider listed below.

Custom Connector
Amazon SES 
Sendgrid 
After adding the sender, it will be displayed under Sender Configuration tab.

Click the ellipsis icon () to Mark as default, Edit, Delete the added sender. Make sure to follow the below points while deleting a sender.
You cannot delete a sender, which is marked as default.
When you delete a sender, a pop-up appears that displays all the active campaigns associated with it. You need to stop each active campaign to delete the sender.
Configure Custom Connector

MoEngage can integrate with any SMTP connector for sending email campaigns. You would need to configure the connector, set up the unsubscribe mechanism, and optionally track bounces & complaints if your SMTP connector can post these details in the required format (as described later in the article)

Configure Custom SMTP Settings
Sender Name: Provide a name for the Sender.
SMTP Host Name: IP Address or server name of the SMTP connector service you are using
SMTP Port: This is the SMTP port number of the connector service to which the connection would be established. To avoid the rate limits set by some hosting companies, we recommend using port 587 instead of port 25.
SMTP Protocol: You can select the protocol prefix (SSL/TLS) that your connector supports.
SMTP Authentication: Select ON here if your SMTP connector requires authentication to establish the connection. Then, enter the SMTP credentials in the username and password.  

Configure Custom Unsubscribe Settings
MoEngage Tracking will add MoEngage's unsubscribe page URL as the email footer - “If you'd like to unsubscribe and stop receiving these emails click here”.
By default, MoEngage redirects your customers to a standard landing page. The only option available there is to re-subscribe. If you want to navigate your customer to a custom landing page e.g. to capture the reason for their unsubscription etc, they can put a link to their own landing page in Unsubscribe Page URL as shown below:
https://api-0X.moengage.com/v1/emailresubscribe
MoEngage hosts each customer in a different data center; you can find your data center number (value of X) by checking the data center and API endpoint mapping here.
Selecting None means MoEngage will not include unsubscribe links in your email campaigns. You are now responsible for including an unsubscribe link while creating the email content. If you don't do it in promotional campaigns, the chances of being identified as spam are high.


 

Configure List Unsubscribe Email
If you select MoEngage Managed option, MoEngage will include its own mail-to and https URL  in email's headers, in all non-transactional emails.
If you select Self Managed option, enter the One-click unsubscribe URL and List unsubscribe email, so that MoEngage will include this in your mail-to and https URL in emails' headers, in all non-transactional emails.



Configure Custom Bounce and Complaint Settings
Bounce & Complaints Tracking: This URL needs to be configured on the ESP's dashboard. They will post events like delivered, bounced, spam complaint on this URL for MoEngage to consume and update stats against the corresponding campaign. MoEngage receive this information in a POST call in the below format to the URL mentioned in your Bounces & Complaint Tracking (Callback URL) field.          

Add the callback URL as shown below: 

https://api-0X.moengage.com/v1/emailbounceendpoint/<>

 MoEngage hosts each customer in a different data center; you can find your data center number (value of X) by checking the data center and API endpoint mapping here.

	        }

	    ]

You are all set up with connector configurations. You can now click Save button to test these settings (including credentials etc.) and save them. You can then select Custom SMTP as the default connector in General Settings. 

General Settings Tab

While creating new email campaigns, the settings from General Settings will be used as defaults. 

The sender that is marked as default, which can either be a MoEngage sender or non MoEngage sender, is listed under the Set a Default Sender field.
In the User attribute that stores user's email address field, add Email (Standard). This is the  MoEngage standard attribute name for the email attribute, where the name is provided by MoEngage, and the value is provided by the client.
If you choose Email from the standard attribute with the correct connector configuration, we will track global opt-out against this email address. 
Positioning of Open Tracking Pixel 

MoEngage allows you to position a tracking pixel at the top or bottom of the email body, thereby tracking the open rates of emails sent to your customers. By default, the tracking pixel is at the bottom of the email to ensure high open rates. If you observe clippings in your email then you can select the Place tracking pixel at the top option to keep the tracking pixel at the top of the email body or else you can keep the tracking pixel at the bottom of the email body by selecting Place tracking pixel at the bottom option.


Bot interaction sensitivity

This section has the following options:

Low sensitivity: This option allows you to track current metrics without segregating email opens between authentic users and bot. It is suitable if you have comparatively fewer Apple MPP users or if you have not had any issues with inflated email opens in the past.
High sensitivity (recommended): This option allows you to know the bot's impact on your email open analytics. You can continue receiving your current and adjusted metrics or only the adjusted metrics. Note that adjusted metrics display only the authentic user open rates. When you select this option, the Metric segregation section with the following options is displayed:

Show Adjusted Metrics Only: This option displays only the authentic user open rates, known as adjusted metrics. On the email analytics page, you can view metrics such as Adjusted Opened, Adjusted Open Rate, and Adjusted Click to Open Rate. When this option is selected, MoEngage does not process any open events whose source is identified as bots.
Include Adjusted Metrics with Current Metrics: This option allows you to display a comparison of adjusted metrics and current metrics. Current metrics will include both bot opens and user opens, whereas adjusted metrics contain only authentic user opens. On the email analytics page, you can view metrics such as Opened and Adjusted Opened, Open rates and Adjusted Open rate, Click to Open Rate, and Adjusted Click to Open Rate. When this option is selected, MoEngage classifies every email open as a bot's or a user's. The same data is aggregated and displayed on the Campaign Analytics page.

To delete an email address, click the Delete icon against it. When you delete an email address that has some active campaigns associated with it, this will stop sending the campaign.
Subscription Management Tab

This tab contains the following sub-tabs:

Opt-in management is a process for obtaining and managing users' permission to send email communications. It involves gaining consent to send emails and handling users' choices about receiving those emails. For more information, refer to Opt-in Management.
Single opt-in and Double opt-in (Recommended) are two approaches to opt-in management, representing different levels of user consent.
Single Opt-in: By default, any new user profile in MoEngage is created using the single-opt-in method. For more information, refer to Single Opt-in.
Double Opt-in (Recommended): All new user profiles are initially opted out. However, these users are considered double opted-in only after providing confirmation through a consent-seeking email. Note that this process doesn't affect existing users.
Click Double opt-in (Recommended) and Save to start adhering to Double Opt-in practices in your MoEngage workspace. For more information, refer to Double Opt-in.
While moving to the Double Opt-in method, make sure to implement the instructions based on whether Inform or Landing Page is enabled for your workspace. For more information on these instructions, refer to Configure Double Opt-in in MoEngage.
Preference management 
Preference Management allows you to automatically exclude specific users from the email campaigns. This tab indicates that the campaigns marked as Spam, Bounce, or Unsubscribe will not be sent to the verified email address.

Subscription categories
Subscription categories are a means to provide your customers with the flexibility to choose the kind of communication that they want to receive from your brand. For more information, refer to Configure Subscription Categories.

PII Tokenization

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Tokenization in email campaigns is a security measure used to protect sensitive data. PII tokenization allows brands to not send PII data to MoEngage and fetch it only on a need basis while sending a message. For more information, refer to PII Tokenized Sending.

When PII Tokenizations is enabled, you are not be able to see User attribute that stores user's email address field under General Settings.

FC and DND

To limit the number of emails sent to users in a certain period, configure frequency capping settings. Do not disturb are quiet hours during which it is advisable not to send any messages to users.  If a message is scheduled to be sent during do-not-disturb hours, you can either discard it or save it for after the do-not-disturb hours. For more information, refer to Frequency Capping and Do Not Disturb.

Delivery Callbacks

To view delivery statistics on the campaign analytics page, you must send the callback as defined below:

The MoE-API will be shown on the Settings dashboard. The API supports only POST requests.
There is no authentication mechanism on the endpoint.
The preferred timeout for the API request must be 5 seconds.
user_id should be taken from the custom_args parameter of the Email Sending API payload.
In the event, you can pass or each case. Note that the values are case-sensitive.

Handle Unsubscribes in Emails
Overview

Marketers using emails must provide an Unsubscribe link in their non-transactional communications to maintain a good domain reputation and comply with regulations. A user hence unsubscribing should be avoided from future communication of a similar nature.

MoEngage as a platform helps marketers adhere to the rule above by providing the following types of Subscription Management:

Global Unsubscribe
List-Unsubscribe
Subscription Categories
Types of Subscription Management in MoEngage Emails
Global Unsubscribe

As the name suggests, this is a way for users to unsubscribe from all non-transactional emails of your brand or business. When a user clicks this link, they can either be unsubscribed directly or be redirected to a landing page to get double confirmation before unsubscribing.

List-Unsubscribe

List-unsubscribe is an ISP-provided way to unsubscribe with just one click. It goes into your email header, and your mailbox providers decide whether to show it to the recipients depending on the reputation, volume, and engagement with the sender. While this used to be a best practice that the clients could follow, since 2024 this is a mandatory compliance to be fulfilled according to Google and Yahoo.

Subscription Categories

This is a way for users to selectively unsubscribe from categories of your communications. Suppose you send emails to share newsletters, product updates, and promotional categories. You can use them to let users subscribe/unsubscribe selectively from the categories that they are interested/not interested in from a single page.

In short, while Subscription Categories are an optional way of managing subscriptions, the other two are mandated for all bulk email senders in email marketing. For more information on subscription categories, click here.

MoEngage Managed vs. Custom or Self-Managed

Broadly, MoEngage offers marketers the following ways to set these up:

MoEngage Managed
This option allows you to seamlessly use MoEngage capabilities to capture and update a user's subscription on MoEngage. If you have other systems (third-party tools or in-house systems), you can forward this information from MoEngage to those systems.
Self-Managed, Custom Managed, or None
This option allows you to invoke your brand's handling of user subscription; it is generally used when brands want to manage user preferences on their side. In such cases, brands would need to capture users' subscriptions and update both their systems and MoEngage.
How to Set Them Up?
Global Unsubscribe
MoEngage-Managed or Tracking
Sendgrid Tracking
Self-Managed or None


With all senders that MoEngage offers out-of-the-box or with whom MoEngage has a partnership or custom senders (that is, with Sendgrid, Amazon SES, Sparkpost, and Mandrill) that MoEngage customers have bought, MoEngage provides an option called Unsubscribe Settings as mentioned here. You can choose MoEngage Tracking here to get help from MoEngage to unsubscribe your users based on their request.

As mentioned in the option, this inserts the following text at the bottom of your email by default:


“If you do not wish to receive future emails, click here”

 

The click here will be hyperlinked to the URL provided in the Unsubscribe Page URL. This will directly unsubscribe the user and will have a call to action (CTA) to resubscribe them if they wish to.

If you want to add any further custom behavior, like a survey to understand why your users are unsubscribing, you can use a custom page of your choice by providing the link to the same in the Unsubscribe Page URL.

List-Unsubscribe
MoEngage-Managed
Self-Managed

Regardless of the sender you are using, we provide an option called One-click Unsubscribe as mentioned here. You can choose MoEngage Managed here to get help from MoEngage to be compliant and provide a one-click way for your users to unsubscribe.

Subscription Categories

To configure the Subscription Categories in MoEngage:

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, go to Settings > Channel > Email.
In the Email page, select the Subscription management tab, and then select the Subscription categories tab.
Click Configure subscription categories.
You can use the out-of-the-box landing page provided by MoEngage to configure your subscription categories or bring your custom landing page to define the same. For more information, click here.

Information

If you are using custom landing pages, perform the necessary steps to pass the preference change back to MoEngage using the API here so that in the future, if users are targeted in the wrong email, MoEngage can take necessary action.

Create Emails in MoEngage with the Types of Subscription Offered
Global Unsubscribe

As mentioned above, in the case of MoEngage-Tracking or Sendgrid Tracking, a default text is always added to the bottom of the email. However, you can customize the position of the same.

MoEngage-Managed
Sendgrid Tracking
None or Custom Tracking

Perform the following steps to insert the unsubscribe link configured in sender settings that tracks unsubscribes through MoEngage in the drag and drop editor:
Select the text in which you want to insert the unsubscribe link.
In the text editor, click Special links > Frequently used > MoE Tracking Unsubscribe Link.

Perform the following steps to insert a custom unsubscribe link while using drag and drop editor:
Drag and drop an HTML block from the editor to the required position.
Add the following HTML code:
<a data-msys-unsubscribe=""1"" href= ""https://www.abc.com/unsubscribe"">Unsubscribe here </a>


Here, https://www.abc.com/unsubscribe is where you must add the unsubscribe URL you want to use.

info	

Information

For this to work correctly, the href attribute should always be linked to the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS).
You can replace the Unsubscribe here text with the required text in any supported language. 

 

Custom HTML Editor

Use the following HTML code to position your unsubscribe text and link in a custom manner:

 

<a data-msys-unsubscribe=""1"" href= ""https://www.abc.com/unsubscribe"">Unsubscribe here </a>

 

info	

Information

You can always add further HTML attributes and CSS values to beautify the same further.
Also, if you want only the Text to be different and not the link, follow the same code with one minor change:
Href should have the value provided in the settings itself.
List-Unsubscribe

Regardless of the type of approach (MoEngage-Managed or Self-Managed), MoEngage will always add the required inputs to the email header automatically in all non-transactional emails. So you need not do any customization or provide manual inputs while creating the campaign.

Subscription Categories
Default Link position

Regardless of the type of landing page used, MoEngage positions the link at the bottom of the email by default, using the following text:

Update your email preferences here to choose the category of emails you wish to receive.

The here in the text above is hyperlinked with the landing page link in the email sent.

Customize the Link Position

You can always customize the position of the  landing page link using the following steps:

Drag and Drop Editor
Custom HTML Editor

Perform the following steps to insert the landing page link of subscription categories in the drag and drop editor:

Select the text in which you want to insert the landing page link.
In the text editor, click Special links > Frequently used > Preference Management.



Show the Subscription Categories Link and Not the Global Unsubscribe Link

By default, MoEngage will always add both the links of Global Unsubscribe and Manage Preference link to the bottom of the email. You can always use the defined HTML code above to custom position both links.

However, if you want to hide the Global unsubscribe link and show only the link to the categories, you can achieve this by the following method:

Analyze Unsubscribes
Global Unsubscribe or List-Unsubscribe

Whenever a user unsubscribes through the link added in the email (Global Unsubscribe link) or the option provided by the ISP (List-Unsubscribe option), MoEngage triggers the Email Unsubscribed event if you are not on None tracking for Unsubscribe or if you configure List unsubscribe handling in the right manner as mentioned here.

Subscription Categories

Whenever a user changes their preferences through an email sent through MoEngage, the MoEngage system triggers the Email Subscription Category Updated event with information around the Campaign, Email Subject, Unsubscribed Categories, and so on.

You can analyze the users who are unsubscribing or changing their preferences through the events above. You can also use these events to find and target the users to change their subscription.

Information

This is applicable for MoEngage-managed landing pages and for workspaces that use custom landing pages but do pass the information back to MoEngage as mentioned here.

Update Subscription Status
Update Unsubscribes from MoEngage to Third-Party Systems
Unsubscribe at the Overall Level

Regardless of whether the unsubscription happened through the List-Unsubscribe or Global Unsubscribe link, you can perform the following steps to pass the status:

Create an event-triggered connector campaign, which is triggered when the Email Unsubscribed event occurs and makes an API call to the third party system’s end-point. For more information on creating a Connector Campaign, refer here. OR
You can use MoEngage Streams to pass the Email Unsubscribed event to your system. For more information on MoEngage Streams, click here.
Change Preferences

Perform the following steps to pass the new preference values:

Create an event-triggered connector campaign, which is triggered when the Email Subscription Category Updated event occurs and makes an API call to the third party system’s end-point to convey the categories the user unsubscribed from. For more information on creating a Connector Campaign, refer here. OR
You can use MoEngage Streams to pass the Email Subscription Category Updated event to your system. For more information on MoEngage Streams, click here.
Update Unsubscribes from Third-Party Systems to MoEngage
Unsubscribe at the Overall Level
API Approach
CSV upload Approach

If you want to unsubscribe a user because they unsubscribed anywhere else (other than MoEngage-based emails), you can use MoEngage Data API to update the same. To achieve this, perform the following steps:

Invoke our Data API as mentioned here.
Set moe_unsubscribe as true.
Finalize the values to be passed for other attributes based on your use case or setup (this is optional).

 

Change Preferences
Update Preferences due to a campaign sent from MoEngage using the Custom Landing page:

If you are using custom landing page and would want to update the preference of the user back in MoEngage, perform the following steps:

Parse through the URL to find the user_id & cid parameter.
Invoke the API mentioned here.
Pass the stored user_id & cid as parameters while executing the API.

For example, if the link to the custom landing page was https://www.abc.com/managepreference, when the user clicks the same from the email, the link will be like below:

https://www.abc.com/managepreference?/?user_id=7XvJW2dj3iS.rYAt4pg5ASBQtaqAMFDw9e89vZCXx_RFfN3eL0wBG008oI6cpncOQV6ESg&cid=5FGZGcA8FRv3Id89JCCczQjwxq6ApEyAarYDje2mzfRQ_WG7VyyFEc0w4L3MA.31a7wzR64fi7lfq8Km0AaeO4paGVul.4HxixDYnoUp21xyUjGtfvnrHSR2G1reTpYPHHU.r3Ac9vE&app_key=UY_GHXBXyaHbiYnCoNOu7eS.u5yIrrN3noTBNZX5mNSL4KN5C5PZ3zcXBKCCxl9w3m0ukw

Here, you can parse and find user_id which in this case will be 7XvJW2dj3iS.rYAt4pg5ASBQtaqAMFDw9e89vZCXx_RFfN3eL0wBG008oI6cpncOQV6ESg and cid will be 5FGZGcA8FRv3Id89JCCczQjwxq6ApEyAarYDje2mzfRQ_WG7VyyFEc0w4L3MA.31a7wzR64fi7lfq8Km0AaeO4paGVul.4HxixDYnoUp21xyUjGtfvnrHSR2G1reTpYPHHU.r3Ac9vE and pass the same while triggering the API.

 

info	

When updating the preference of users via API, if MoEngage receives any value for a category that is archived or disabled in MoEngage, we will not update the preference for that category. Neither will we raise the event if the change was only for the archived / disabled categories.

Updating Preferences from third-party systems to MoEngage:
API Approach
CSV upload Approach

To update the preference of the user from a third-party system to MoEngage, perform the following steps:

Invoke our API that updates Subscription Categories.
Pass the status of categories that you want to change for a user in the data key of the API body
Finalize the values to be passed for other attributes based on your use case or setup (this is optional).
info	

When updating the preference of users via API, if MoEngage receives any value for a category that is archived or disabled in MoEngage, we will not update the preference for that category.

 

Resubscribe Users in MoEngage and in Senders

You may want to resubscribe a user who has previously unsubscribed on the MoEngage platform and on the Sendgrid platform simultaneously. The MoEngage Resubscribe API resets the unsubscribe flag to “false” for users on MoEngage and makes a call to SendGrid to remove the email addresses (associated with the unsubscribed users) from their suppression list.

To achieve the same, perform the following steps:

Collate the list of Email IDs to be resubscribed.
Invoke the MoEngage Resubscribe API as mentioned here.
Set update_esp=true and pass the list of email IDs in the recipients key as an array.

Email Warm-Up
Warm-Up

Email warm-up is the process of building trust for an email account with Internet service providers (ISPs). This process includes sending emails from a new email account, starting with a smaller number, and gradually increasing the number of emails each day.

As a marketer, you must establish a positive sender reputation for an email address before sending huge email campaigns. This helps to prevent your emails from being marked as spam and increase the likelihood of reaching your recipients’ inboxes.

Importance of Warm-Up

Email warm-up is essential when you want to send email campaigns with a new account to ensure emails land in inbox. With a warm-up, you can distinguish yourself from spammers and make your emails seem genuine to the ISP.

Unlike a traditional email campaign, email warm-up is specifically designed to improve deliverability. Even the best email marketing campaigns to highly engaged lists can still have low open and reply rates.

Reasons to warm up an email account before using it for outreach:

Establish trust as a valid email account, not a spam account
Increase deliverability
Build (or repair) your sender reputation
Scale your outreach faster 
Send campaigns to your full limits
Lower the chance of your account getting suspended for suspicious activity

ISPs are skeptics at best when it comes to deciding on emails' inbox placement. While authentication (DKIM and SPF setup) is important, it is not enough for the ISPs to trust you. You need to build the trust gradually by ensuring high engagement in your emails. If emails are coming from a new IP/domain that has not built a good reputation as yet, ISPs might handle your emails as follows:

Only accept a small number of emails
Receive emails at a slow pace
Place all emails in the spam folder
Send the first few emails in the inbox, monitor the engagement from the initial recipients, and then determine where to send the rest of the emails.
Block emails from you if you try to send more than a smaller number

Note: Your reputation with the ISPs can take a hit with even a single bad campaign. Recovering from such a setback can take anywhere between 4 to 8 weeks.

Guidelines for Warm-Up

As part of the warm-up, you need to send relevant emails to a small volume of users who are most likely to engage. The exact amount of time required to do this will depend on the current reputation of your domain/IP and the performance of your campaigns. The following are some high-level guidelines:

 Send lower volumes to begin with, increase them gradually, and throttle your campaigns. Do not worry about scaling up initially; instead, focus on generating positive engagement.
Send to users who are most likely to engage positively.
Pay attention to performance metrics, such as delivery rate, open rate, click rate, spam complaints, and unsubscribes. Course correct based on your observations.
Check your reputation on postmaster sites, and inbox placement data on third-party sites. Course correct based on your observations.
Monitor your performance metrics and reputation closely for the first ten days. After your reputation is stable, move to ramp-up.
Ramp-Up

Email Ramp-up is a deliverability best practice used to increase your daily email sending limit over time gradually. It involves sending emails to a small segment of your most engaged users and then gradually increasing the volume with each subsequent send.

Difference Between Warm-Up and Ramp-Up

Warm-up and ramp-up are not the same. The following are the differences:

 	Warm-Up	Ramp-Up
What is it?	Is the process of building a positive reputation for any new domain/IP with the ISPs.	Is the process gradually scaling up to the volumes you intend to send from a domain and/or IP.
When is it required?	Is required whenever you want to start sending emails from a new IP and/or domain.	Is required if your sending volume is going to be >50% of your average peak volume or if you have yet to send any emails in 3+ weeks.
Why is it required?	Is required for you to ensure that your emails land in the inboxes of your customers.	Is required for you to ensure timely delivery and inbox placement of your emails to your customers.
How fast is it?	Is slow so it takes time to warm-up.	Tends to be faster.
Importance of Ramp-Up

After building a good reputation, you need to increase the sending volume until you reach your daily average. The pace of ramp-up, however, should be determined based on the campaigns' performance and domain/IP reputation during warm-up.

If they are excellent, you can ramp up much faster and take some calculated risks.
If they are average, ramp up at a breathable pace, and progress cautiously.
If either of them is bad, fix it first.

Benefits of ramp-up:

Prevents sending too much too fast
Helps build a positive sender reputation
Avoids volume spikes that can trigger blocks
Simplifies warm-up pacing
Helps to safely scale your outreach
Guidelines for Ramp-Up

Increase your daily sending volume by 30%-50% each day. Ensure that your performance does not drop and that the domain and IP reputation stays consistent.

Your intended daily/weekly/monthly volume defines the volume you should ramp up to. For example:

User base	Peak Volume	Ramp up plan
100K	100K	Ramp up to 100K.
100K	50K	Ramp up to 50K.
100K	General sending volume is 20K. Once a month, 100K.	For general sending volume, 20K ramp-up will suffice.  For the monthly 100K send, you will need to use a segmented strategy.

Note: IPs start getting cold after 2 weeks, and thus higher infrequent volumes will require special handling.

You can control the volume during ramp-up in multiple ways:

Create smaller segments based on the daily prescribed volume.
Use control groups while creating campaigns.
If applicable, we will also enable back-end limits.
Scale-Up

While ramp-ups are done at the time of onboarding, scale-ups address the seasonality in sales that most businesses observe. The marketing efforts, as a result, also need to follow the same cycles. In peak seasons, your sending volumes can be higher than usual. To meet the same, the emails sent need to be increased to those levels. This is known as a scale-up and is done in the weeks leading to the peak.

Typically, a larger user base at such times includes lesser engaged users, and hence an integral part of the scale-up becomes segmenting such inactive users based on their last activity/inactivity, sign-up date, sign-up source, and so on. This helps avoid any negative impact of the scale-up on your domain's/IP's reputation."

Getting Started with Email
Configure Subscription Categories
Overview

Subscription categories are a means to provide your customers with the flexibility to choose the kind of communication that they want to receive from your brand. Such a feature helps users opt-in only for those communication categories they are interested in. You can use subscription categories to tailor the communication according to user preferences and understand your audience better. Subscription categories can help you reduce the unsubscription rate, increase customer engagement, and improve your brand's relationship with the customer.

For example, you could have categories such as product updates, newsletters, and announcements. Users interested in product updates can subscribe to them alone instead of unsubscribing from your brand's email communications.

When you add only unsubscribe links at the end of the email, and the user chooses to unsubscribe, they get unsubscribed from receiving all promotional emails from your brand. However, having a preference management page enables you to present options about the various kinds of content they can receive from your brand. The customer can then subscribe to whichever categories they want or unsubscribe from all as per their preference.

Use Case

If you are a travel brand offering bus, hotel, and flight reservations, your preference management page can have the following options for each of these offerings:

Promotions
Recommendations
Deals

The below image illustrates a sample preferences page.

How does a user subscribe to categories?

When a user wishes to unsubscribe from receiving emails from your brand, they click on the unsubscribe link in the email footer. When you don't have a setup to manage subscription preferences, the user has no option but to unsubscribe from all promotional communication from your brand. However, if you have subscription categories set up, you can provide users with options to manage their preferences, and they would land on the subscription preferences page where they can subscribe to relevant and interesting categories.

Terms to Know

Categories

These are the classifications of the communication being sent to customers. They represent the different genres of content put out by the brand. For example, categories for a travel booking website could be promotions, discounts, offers, and so on.

Groups

Groups are a collection of categories. They are useful for presenting the categories more contextually to the user. For example, a travel booking website could offer bookings for buses and flights. The same promotional categories could apply to both. Groups provide a means to club relevant categories under each head and present them to the user.

Note: Categories remain unique, and MoEngage tracks subscriptions at the category level.

Landing Page

The landing page is the URL the user would be redirected to when clicking on Manage preferences in the email footer. This will showcase all the possible categories for the user to select/choose from.

Setup

To set up the MoEngage landing page, navigate to Settings > Channel > Email > Subscription Categories in the Dashboard. Click Configure Subscription Categories to choose the landing page for which you want to configure subscription categories.

When setting up subscription categories for the first time, you can choose the MoEngage landing page or a custom landing page, as shown below.

MoEngage Landing Page

When you choose MoEngage landing page as the option, you will get the following screen where you can add categories and groups and preview the landing page.

If you are employing MoEngage Tracking for Unsubscribes, you'll have the option to use either the default MoEngage Landing Page or a Custom Landing Page to manage your user preferences.

Custom Landing Page

You can use this option to have a customized landing page and completely control the look and feel of your landing page. When you choose the Custom Landing page option, you must add the preference page URL as shown below.

User preferences must be manually ported to MoEngage if you are using the custom landing page. This can be done using the Update Subscription Preferences API. For more information, refer to Update Preferences API and Bulk Update Subscription Preferences API.

info	

MoEngage Landing Page vs. Custom Landing Page

The MoEngage Landing Page is available for everyone as a default option. You can choose the MoEngage Landing Page if you don't have the resources to build one. Enable MoEngage subscription tracking and customize your landing page with categories and groups. If you want extensive customization options, you can choose the custom landing page and build it according to your needs. When you have a custom landing page designed, all you have to do is add the category name and the landing page URL.

Configuring Categories, Groups, and Landing Page
MoEngage Landing Page

Choose MoEngage Landing Page in the Configure Subscription Categories option.

Categories

The Categories section helps you add, edit, disable, and archive categories.

Add Category

To add a category, click on +Add category in the top right corner of the Categories section. 

In the following in the Add a new Category screen enter the following details and click on Add at the bottom right corner to add a category.


Category Name

MoEngage uses the category name to identify a category uniquely. This is used internally for earmarking a category and is not visible to the user on the landing page. We recommend adding the group reference to which the category belongs while creating the category name to avoid confusion when using groups.

For example, there could be categories such as promotions and announcements that apply to multiple groups. Adding group references such as Promotions-Buses, Promotions-Flights, and so on can help you distinguish between the categories. MoEngage uses the category name to track the subscriptions.

Display Name

This is the label attached to a category shown on the landing pages. Display names need not be unique and can be similar across different groups. For example, if we have the promotions category under groups called Flights and Buses, the display names can be Promotions for both categories while the category names would have to be unique (for example, Promotions_Flights, Promotions_Buses, and so on). The Display Name is an aesthetic placeholder.

Description

This field will be shown on the landing page and describes the purpose of the category and information about the type of content to be expected when the customer subscribes to this category.

Groups

This field will be shown on the landing page and help you link the category to available groups. This field is optional, and the category-to-group mapping can be done post-category creation too.

Enter a name for the import in the Import name field.
Select user type as Registered users.
Click upload from the computer in the Select file field to upload the CSV file. Make sure to follow the below points while uploading the CSV file. In the CSV file to be uploaded:
One column should be reserved for IDs. These are the customer IDs that you use to identify your customers uniquely. For example, they could be the email IDs of your customers.
Maintain another column for the array of subscription categories from which your customers should be unsubscribed. Follow the below format to pass the unsubscribed categories: [""abc""|""xyz""|""def""]; where abc,xyz, and def are unsubscribed categories.

For example, As a marketer, you need a customer named John with email id: john@gmail.com, to be unsubscribed from unsubscategory1 and unsubscategory2. Then the CSV file to be uploaded should have the following format:
john@gmail.com, [""unsubscategory1""|""unsubscategory2""], in which the email id should be added in one column and [""unsubscategory1""|""unsubscategory2""] should be in the other column.

After uploading the file, click Preview file to preview the uploaded file. Click Next.

In the following screen, all the values will be preloaded under the Required mapping section as per the CSV file. You can also change the values if required.
Under Map columns section, map your Identifier column (in this example, the Email ID) to ID and Email Unsubscribed Categories column to the Email Unsubscribe Categories attribute. The categories are preloaded in Array String format.

You can select Do not create new users option if you want to exclusively modify the profiles of users who are already in your Moengage account.
You can enable the Save as a file segment toggle button if you want the users in the uploaded CSV file to be saved as a segment.
You can enable the Send import status toggle button and select an email ID to send import status to that ID. Click Next.

This is an Early Access feature. To enable it for your account, contact your CSM or raise a support ticket.

Overview

As a marketer, ensuring proper opt-in management is crucial for building trust with your audience and complying with regulations. Opt-in management describes the practices you employ to obtain and manage user consent for communications, primarily through emails. This includes two essential actions: 

Obtain explicit user consent for email communications.
Empower recipients to control what email communications they receive.

Understanding these opt-in practices is essential for effective and compliant email marketing. To help you implement these principles, MoEngage offers the following opt-in methods:

Single Opt-in
Double Opt-in
Single Opt-in

Single Opt-in is an email subscription method where a user subscribes to receive communications immediately after providing their email address, typically during a website signup process. This method assumes that by providing their email address during signup, the user has implicitly consented to receive communications.

By default, MoEngage implements the single opt-in method whenever a user profile is created in your dashboard. MoEngage assumes that the user providing their email ID makes them eligible to receive emails. This method prioritizes ease of sign-up with the assumption of immediate consent.

This method is commonly used in the Southeast Asian Region, including India. In contrast, European regulations often require explicit confirmation for marketing communications, with transactional emails being an exception.

info	

Information

Single Opt-in operates on the assumption of consent.
Though straightforward, Single Opt-in can sometimes lead to less engaged subscribers or include email addresses entered by mistake.
The regulations of some regions, aiming for higher engagement quality, highlight the significance of Double Opt-in.
Double Opt-in

Double Opt-in is a subscription method in which users must take an additional step to confirm their subscription after initially providing their email address during signup. Typically, this involves clicking a confirmation link in an email sent to the address provided. Only after this confirmation are users subscribed to receive promotional emails. This method prioritizes subscriber verification and engagement through an extra confirmation step.

Double opt-in helps you in the following ways:

Higher quality email list: Double Opt-in verifies that subscribers are genuinely interested, resulting in a list of more engaged users. This can lead to better open rates, click-through rates, and overall campaign performance. 
Reduced spam complaints: By requiring explicit confirmation, Double Opt-in significantly reduces the likelihood of users marking emails as spam. This protects the sender's reputation and improves email deliverability. 
Improved deliverability: Email providers view Double Opt-in as a sign of legitimate email practices. This can enhance deliverability rates, ensuring that emails reach the intended recipients' inboxes.
Greater accuracy of email addresses: Double Opt-in helps to ensure that the email addresses collected are valid and correctly entered. This reduces bounce rates caused by typos or fake addresses. 
Enhanced sender reputation: Sending emails to engaged subscribers who have confirmed their interest improves the sender's reputation with email providers. A good sender reputation is crucial for email deliverability. 
Double Opt-in in MoEngage

Whenever a user profile is created, MoEngage tracks whether the user has provided a double opt-in confirmation using the attribute Email Opt-in Status. This attribute can have the following values:

Optin pending: This value indicates that the user has not yet provided consent to receive email communications. Additionally, user profiles in MoEngage that do not contain the Email Opt-in status attribute will be treated as users with the value Optin pending.
Double opted in: This value indicates that the user has provided their explicit consent to receive email communications.
Opted out: This value indicates that the user has unsubscribed from receiving email communications.

The following scenarios explain how user interactions affect opt-in status:

Scenario 1: For a new user who recently signed up for your website following its adoption of double opt-in

John signed up for your website. Upon signing up: 

MoEngage creates a profile for John in your workspace.
MoEngage sets John's opt-in status to Optin pending.
You send a consent-seeking email to John, requesting his preferences.

John can then:

Not respond to consent-seeking email: John's Email Opt-in Status remains Optin pending because he has not provided consent.
Interact with the consent-seeking email: John clicks the confirmation link and selects his subscription category preferences while providing his consent. MoEngage changes John's Email Opt-in Status to Double opted in.
Change his preferences after providing consent: MoEngage updates the preferences accordingly, and the Email Opt-in Status remains as Double opted in.
Unsubscribe from your email: John's Email Opt-in Status changes to Opted out.
Scenario 2: For an existing user who signed up on the website before it adopted double opt-in

David is an existing user of your website. He existed before your website implemented double Opt-in. For such a user:

MoEngage sets David's opt-in status to Optin pending because he has not shared his preferences yet.
You send a consent-seeking email to John, requesting his preferences.
David can receive other promotional emails based on the campaign settings that were made live previously.

David can then:

Not respond to consent-seeking email: David's Email Opt-in Status remains Optin pending because he has not provided consent.
Interact with the consent-seeking email: David clicks the confirmation link and selects his subscription category preferences while providing his consent. MoEngage changes David's Email Opt-in Status to Double opted in.
Change his preferences:
After providing consent: David changes his preferences after providing his consent. MoEngage updates the subscription category preferences accordingly, and the Email Opt-in Status remains as Double opted in.
Interact with an older email: David interacts with an older email and changes his preferences. MoEngage updates the subscription category preferences accordingly, and the Email Opt-in Status changes from Optin pending to Double opted in.
Unsubscribe from your email:
After providing consent: David unsubscribed from your email after providing his consent. David's Email Opt-in Status changes from Double opted in to Opted out.
Interact with an older email: David interacts with an older email and unsubscribes from your email. MoEngage unsubscribes David, and the Email Opt-in Status changes from Optin pending to Opted out.
info	

Information

Whenever there is a change in opt-in status through any emails or landing pages, an event named Email Opt-in Status Updated is triggered to track all these actions.

Configure Double Opt-in in MoEngage

You can access the Double Opt-in method from the Subscription Management > Opt-in Management tab of Email settings. 

To move to the Double Opt-in Method, make sure you implement the following instructions, based on whether Inform or Landing Page is enabled for your workspace:

Existing User
New User

If you have a record of your existing users' opt-in status and wish to update it in MoEngage, you can perform a bulk update using one of the following methods:

Trigger the Track User Data API of MoEngage to update the opt-in status. For more information, refer to Track User.
Update the Opt-in status using the user imports capability of MoEngage. Perform the following steps to upload the opt-in via CSV upload for your users:
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage Segment, and then click User Imports.
On the User Imports page, click Import users in the upper-right corner.

Balance Engagement and Reachability Using Double Opt-in 

While the Double Opt-in method allows you to engage primarily with subscribers who have demonstrated a high level of interest, it's important to acknowledge that this approach can significantly reduce the overall number of subscribers on your list. This trade-off between subscriber quality and quantity is a key consideration for you.

For brands with a presence across different geographical regions, the decision to implement Double Opt-in can be strategically applied at a regional level. This flexibility recognizes that email marketing best practices and legal requirements regarding consent can vary substantially from one part of the world to another.

The Double Opt-in option of MoEngage allows you to enable or disable the Send only to double-opted-in users toggle based on these regional considerations while creating the email campaign. This allows for a tailored approach to email list management. For more information, refer here.

List-Unsubscribe Email

While seeing your subscribers go is difficult, it is often for the best!

So, making the process easier is always beneficial for an organization like yours. While, as a mandate, all promotional emails have a link to unsubscribe within the body of the email, the easiest way to help your users find this is to use List-Unsubscribe, which is a compliance requirement as of 2024.

What Is List-Unsubscribe?

List-unsubscribe is essentially an ISP-provided way to unsubscribe with just one click. It goes into your email header, and your mailbox providers decide whether to show it to the recipients depending on the reputation, volume, and engagement with the sender.

Clicking the ISP-provided native unsubscribe option can unsubscribe your users broadly in two manners:

One-Click Unsubscribe (RFC 8058)
This unsubscribes the user automatically because this will invoke the URI, the purpose of which is to do the same.
Mail-to Unsubscribe
This initiates an email on behalf of the user to the email mentioned within the email header. You are supposed to parse the emails and unsubscribe the users within 48 hours of the request.
How Does This Look in My User's Inbox?

 

info	

Information

While bulk senders are mandated to add this to their promotional emails, displaying the Unsubscribe button is under the mailbox’s purview, and no one can influence it.

Why Should I Do This?

While this was a deliverability best practice earlier, since June 2024, Gmail and Yahoo have made this a mandate to be followed by all of the bulk senders in their deliverability practices.

Though this is a mandatory process, following this not only helps you be compliant with the rule but also helps in the following ways:

Minimize your spam complaint rate
Optimize engagement and performance by sending emails only to interested subscribers
Potentially reduce email marketing costs by routinely cleaning list size
End subscriber relationships on a positive note
MoEngage Managed vs Self-Managed

MoEngage helps you adhere to these practices in two ways:

MoEngage Managed - Using this option allows you to seamlessly use MoEngage capabilities to capture and update a user's subscription on MoEngage. If you have other systems (3rd Party tools or in-house systems), you can forward this information from MoEngage to those systems.

Brand or Self Managed - Using this option allows you to invoke your brand's handling of user un-subscription; Generally used when brands want to manage user preferences on their side. In such cases, brands would need to capture users' un-subscriptions and update both their systems as well as MoEngage.

How Can I Configure This in MoEngage

You can use either of the two options based on your requirements:

Configure via MoEngage-Managed Approach
Configure via Self-Managed Approach


MoEngage Managed

MoEngage adds its unsubscribe URL and an email ID in the email header under the HTTPS URL section and mail-to section, respectively. While the former helps users unsubscribe with a click, the latter unsubscribes the user via the mail-to method of list-unsubscribe, as explained above. Also, MoEngage processes all requests and updates the preferences of the users in your workspace (formerly known as DB or dashboard).

 

To configure the list-unsubscribe via the MoEngage-managed approach:

Log in to your MoEngage dashboard.
Navigate to Settings > Channels > Email settings > Sender Configuration tab.
Click the email connector.
Click the vertical ellipsis icon and click Edit.
Under One-click unsubscribe, click MoEngage Managed.

How Does This Work?

As mentioned above, MoEngage adds its unsubscribe URL and email ID to the email headers when sending any promotional emails. When a user clicks Unsubscribe shown in the Inbox, one of the following will happen:

One-click approach:
When the user clicks Unsubscribe and confirms, the request is directly sent to MoEngage API, which processes it immediately and updates the user's preferences in the profile.
Mail-to approach:
When the user clicks Unsubscribe and confirms, an email from the ISP will be sent to one of our inboxes. MoEngage will process it within 48 hours and update the user's preference in the profile.
How to pass this to your systems?

If you'd want to pass the change in the preference of your users to any in-house system or third party systems, you can do the following:

Setup an event-triggered connector campaign that is triggered when Email Unsubscribed event is triggered to hit the APIs of yours or the third-party system and update the value. Refer here to know more.
Setup Streams to pass the Email Unsubscribed event to your endpoint. This can be further processed by you or passed to other systems. Refer here to know more.

Self Managed

How to find users who unsubscribed via this

MoEngage will raise Email Unsubscribed event with the attribute source as List Unsubscribe whenever we receive the request from a user to unsubscribe themselves. This applies for both MoEngage and Self-Managed approaches. However, for the Self-Managed Approach, ensure the outlined steps have been followed correctly.

Sign In With Apple

If your app or website supports Sign In With Apple, you must configure the same in Apple developer configuration to ensure your emails are delivered to users with Apple Relay IDs (ending with @privaterelay.appleid.com). Otherwise, your emails will either get bounced or quarantined by the Apple Relay Service, which means that users with the Apple Relay Email IDs will not see your email in their mailboxes. For more information, refer to Sign In With Apple.

Signing In with Apple

With the release of iOS 13, Apple introduced a feature called Sign in with Apple that allows users to authenticate or sign in to websites and apps that support signing in with Apple IDs. Hide My Email is a privacy feature available since this release, where users who do not prefer to reveal their email addresses to a service can hide it from the service by creating app-specific email addresses. These email addresses are called Apple private relay email addresses and are available in the following format: <unique-alphanumeric-string>@privaterelay.appleid.com> 

For more information, refer to Hide My Email.

How do Apple Relay IDs work?

If users do not prefer revealing their email addresses to a service, they can hide them by creating app-specific email addresses, termed ""Apple private relay"" email addresses"". In this case, the service has visibility to the Apple Relay ID alone and can use the same for email communication. When emails are sent to these Apple relay addresses, they are automatically forwarded to the user's mailboxes.

info	

Note

Suppose the sender tries to send an email to a different private relay address not associated with their service. In that case, the email will get bounced with the reason listed as 'unauthorized sender'. This ensures that spam emails do not reach the user's mailbox, even if the private relay address gets shared.

Apple Developer Configuration

To ensure the emails are delivered to users using their app-specific email addresses, Apple has laid out a set of steps that senders/developers must perform to deliver emails successfully. 

Log in to your Apple Developer account.
Navigate to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles in your Apple Developer account. For more information, refer to Apple Resources.
Click Services in the sidebar.
Click Configure under Sign in with Apple for Email Communication.
In the Email Sources section, click the add button (+).
Enter a comma-delimited list of the “Individual Email Addresses” or the “return-path/envelope domains” that will be used for email communication.
Find the individual email addresses for SendGrid configuration.
Find the envelope domains for other configurations.
Click Next.
Confirm the email sources entered and click Register. The table will display if the registered email source passed an SPF check.

If any of the sources show SPF failure, review the DNS configuration.

Find the Individual Email Addresses for SendGrid configuration

The format of the sign-in Apple address is bounces+12345@mail.example.com, where 12345 is your SendGrid account ID, and mail.example.com is the authenticated domain in your SendGrid account.

Log in to your SendGrid account.
Navigate to Settings > Sender Authentication > Domain Authentication.
Copy your Sign In With Apple Address.

Configure SSL Branded Links for SendGrid

 

MoEngage uses SendGrid as the default email sender for all the customers. All the clickable links in the email are converted to the SendGrid domain for click tracking, but the clicks are ultimately redirected to your website. If your customers observe the links before clicking on them, they will see sendgrid.com/some-landing-page rather than yourdomain.com/some-landing-page. Opt-in for Link branding if you want the links to be displayed as yourdomain.com.

Link branding can be set up by adding a couple of CNAME records in your DNS, but to ensure that the links are secure, you must also set up SSL for your domain. So, to finish link branding, you need to do the following steps.

Setup and validate link branding by adding CNAME records.
Set up SSL on the domain.
Verify if SSL is set up properly.
After you set up SSL, Kindly inform our team so we can take the final steps to finish the link branding.

Let's explore these steps in detail.

 

 

Set up link branding with CNAMEs

You should have received documentation from our team to add some DNS records, including a couple of DNS records with the purpose of Link Branding. Once you add these records, your link branding is set up. Your DNS records should look like this in the table given below.

 

If you stop at this step, Your link branding will work on HTTP. Please take some time to set up SSL so that browsers don't highlight the website as insecure to your customers.

The next step is to add SSL for your domain.

Set up SSL for the domain

In this step, you will have to set up SSL on your domain and also forward the requests coming to this domain to sendgrid.net. Terminate your SSL before forwarding the requests to sendgrid.net. Check step no.2 to read more on how to forward the request.

Step 1 - You must set up SSL for lurl.example.com, as you would for other domains. 

 

Step 2 - Forward all the requests coming to lurl.example.com to sendgrid.net. You can forward the request using your own CDN, Proxy, or API Gateway
If you want to set this up using CDNs like CloudFlare, CloudFront, KeyCDN, or Fastly, please refer to the respective documentation if you need help.
If using AzureCDN, put lurl.example.com in the Origin host header while configuring your CDN profile.
If you are using a Proxy, please refer to this link for additional help - https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/custom-ssl-configurations
API Gateway setup will differ based on the gateway, but ensure that you are forwarding the request to SendGrid.net with the HTTP host header as lurl.example.com

 

At this point, your DNS records should look like this in the table given below.

 

 

 

While setting up SSL, you will edit the CNAME record for lurl.example.com and point that to CDN, proxy, or API gateway. 

info	

Note

Do not change the CNAME for 123456.example.com, and it should still point to sendgrid.net. 123456 is an example, and it can vary for your implementation. Please refer to the documentation shared with you for link branding implementation.
Do not revalidate the records after configuring SSL, as the Link Branding will break.

 

Verify the SSL setup

Follow the below steps if your SSL is set up properly

To check that your forwarding and proxy setup is correct, run a dig command in the terminal to check that the first CNAME resolves at your CDN and not sendgrid.net.
For a dig in MacOS X, the command would be: dig cname mail.domain.com
In Windows, using the command prompt (e.g., cmd.exe), an example of the command would be: nslookup -q=CNAME example.com
If sendgrid.net is in the answer or authority section of the query, you will need to double-check if your CNAME in your DNS points to your CDN or Proxy or API gateway and not sendgrid.net
After this, our team would have sent you a link for testing. If you click on this link, it should take you to google.com. This is the final validation and confirms that SSL is setup properly and properly forwarded to sendgrid.net

After successfully setting up SSL, contact the MoEngage team to discuss the next steps.

Contact MoEngage team

After you set up the SSL, the MoEngage team will take the final steps to verify the entire setup and enable SSL click tracking on SendGrid. If you are using your own SendGrid, raise a support ticket with SendGrid.

 

 

FAQs
What is link branding?

Please refer to this article for more information on link branding - https://sendgrid.com/en-us/blog/how-to-set-up-ssl-click-tracking . This article explains why link branding is needed, why we must set up SSL, how to forward requests to Sendgrid, and some console commands to test the integration.

 
Why is SSL setup needed?

Top browser Chrome starts showing insecure links on the webpages when they aren't enabled on HTTPS - read more about this here. Safari browser, by default, will not even render HTTP pages, so it's recommended that SSL is set up on your domain when your customers click on any email links. At MoEngage, we have seen that some of our customers reported page loading issues on HTTP websites, so we are making SSL setup a best practice as part of the email setup, but it's not a mandatory step. Please evaluate the risks of pages not loading vs setting up SSL and take a final call.

 

Do I have to share the SSL certificate with MoEngage?

No, there is no need to share the SSL certificate with MoEngage. Kindly terminate SSL at your proxy, CDN, or API gateway and simply forward the request to sendgrid.net.

 

Wrong Link Error

Wrong Link Error happens when the forwarded request doesn't have the Host HTTP header as lurl.example.com 

If you are using CDN, Some CDNs automatically put the Host Header from the original request; in that case, you need not take any action to add this header additionally. In Azure CDN, you must configure this by putting lurl.example.com in the Origin host header while configuring your CDN.

If you use a proxy, you must explicitly set this Host header to lurl.example.com, as mentioned in the setup instructions.

 

How do I setup a proxy using Nginx?

After you terminate SSL for lurl.example.com on your load balancer and forward the request to your VM or proxy, using Nginx, you can forward the request to SendGrid with the right host header. You can use the following sample code to set up the Nginx Configuration. Kindly replace lurl.example.com with your domain link. 

Nginx Conf

Pre-Send Checklist

This section outlines the things that a new email sender should monitor before they are ready to send emails.

Set up the infrastructure for the sender and domain from which you wish to send emails.
Make sure all the setup and compliance requirements are met.
Make sure the email settings are added in the MoEngage UI and the email statistics are tracked as expected.
Make sure that you ramped up to send volume you are attempting to send.
Check the highest volume sent in the last 30 days
Check if the volume you are planning to send is less than 150% of the highest volume you sent in the last 30 days. if yes, you can go ahead and send emails. For example, if the volume sent in the last 30 days is 100k, and the volume you are planning to send is less than 150k, you can go ahead and send emails.
if the above criteria is not satisfied, and:
You have sent twice the peak volume in the last 30 days, then split the volume into two and send them with a 4-hour gap.
You have sent more than twice the peak volume, then scale up to reach that volume and increase the 50% volume each day until you reach that number.
If it’s a one-off email, then you can split it into multiple segments and send it in over 2-3 days without following scale-up.

Validations to be Performed Before Publishing the Email

Executing the steps above helps you test the email settings after the setup. You are advised to use the features below before publishing a campaign to ensure your emails work as you expect:

Check the Email Campaign Content
Preview the Email Content in the Editor: Preview the email content while creating it using the drag-and-drop or Custom HTML editor. Use this method to perform a sanity check on the rendering of your email content. Note that the addition of unsubscribe or manage preference links and open/click tracking related changes do not occur since no email has been sent.
Inbox Previews: Preview your email content across a combination of devices, email clients, and web browsers. Use this method to check the email is rendering properly on the combinations used by your email subscribers. Since no email has been sent, the addition of links or tracking related changes doesn't occur here either. For more information, refer to Inbox Previews.
Test Campaign: This method helps you check the email content by sending an actual email. Since an email is sent out, clicks and open stats, unsubscribe and manage preference links all get included in this email. Use this method to perform the final rendering check and validate the link's redirection before publishing a campaign."

Things to Consider Before Migrating IPs from SendGrid,https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/30519909227028-SendGrid-IP-Migration,"User Guide

SendGrid IP Migration

This article explains the migration of a dedicated SendGrid IP or outbound email from one account to another. 

If you wish to perform this migration and the accounts are not connected as a parent or sub-user, the administrators of both accounts must provide their written consent to proceed with the migration request.

Things to Consider Before Migrating IPs from SendGrid

Suppose your domain maintains a high reputation and is associated with dedicated IPs with a similar high reputation. In that case, migration is beneficial as this shortens the time needed for ramp-up because the migrated IP would already be warmed up.

Make sure to understand the following points before migrating the IPs from Sendgrid:

You can migrate only dedicated IPs. Shared IPs can’t be migrated because they are interconnected with multiple accounts or domains.
Migration is beneficial only if you migrate IPs with a high domain reputation.
Migration is a cut-off process. The SendGrid support team removes IPs from the client’s account and adds them to MoEngage’s Sendgrid account, so there will be short downtime during this period. Note that you can't use IPs from two different SendGrid accounts simultaneously.
You can use domains or subdomains in parallel from n number of ESPs, vendors, or SendGrid accounts. Technically, this is not an issue, but it is not recommended.
There is a downtime during the migration. This migration process requires coordination, meaning the DNS should be validated during or before the downtime. Ensure you are ready to send emails from MoEngage right after migrating IPs. If you migrate IPs and then spend 2 to 3 weeks or more to get your first email sent from MoEngage, IPs would lose reputation by then.

Migrating IPs is a good option, only if the IP already has a high reputation and a good sending history for at least 3 months and is already ramped up.

Migration does not offer any benefits if a new migrated IP has not undergone the ramp-up process.
If you migrate an IP with a bad reputation and delivery issues, you need to spend a lot of time (at least 6-8 weeks) fixing them.
Migrate SendGrid IPs

The following steps explain the process of migrating SendGrid IPs from one account to another:

The admin of the account hosting the dedicated IP should send an email to SendGrid support requesting to migrate the IP to the new account. The email should contain:
The IP address to be migrated.
The account with which this IP is associated.
The account to which this IP is to be migrated.
The admin of the account receiving the dedicated IP should also send an email to SendGrid support confirming their willingness to accept the dedicated IP into their account. This email should also include the IP address in question and the account it is to be migrated.
After the SendGrid support team receives written permission from both account admins, they will proceed with the migration process. This may involve some downtime as IPs are moved between accounts.
You can include the preferred date when you want the migration to take place.
After the migration, SendGrid support team notifies both account admins that the process has been finalized and the dedicated IP is active in the new account."

Mail Privacy Protection (MPP) and Email Analytics
Overview

Mail Privacy Protection (MPP) protects customers who use the Apple Mail app by preventing marketers from detecting when the customers open an email. MPP masks customers’ IP addresses so they can't be linked to other online activity or used to determine their location.

For users who opt-in to MPP, emails are preloaded using proxy servers. In this process, the server stores all the images, including the email tracking pixel, hindering the ability to use tracking pixels for metrics such as open tracking. As a marketer, you can expect MPP to result in issues regarding email engagement metrics.

How Is MPP Connected with Email Analytics?

To measure how email campaigns work, email marketers usually add a square transparent image in their email messages. When a receiver opens this email, the image gets downloaded. This image captures different types of data, including when the email was opened, the platform it was opened on, location, and many more. This analytics helps marketers relate better with their customers, curate better content, and keep them engaged with relevant emails.

When a marketer sends an email to a customer who has opted into Apple's MPP policy, Apple stores and downloads the entire email on its server. In this process, the server stores all images, including the email-tracking pixel. Thus, email marketers might believe that the customer opened the email erroneously. If the customer chooses to open the email, the Mail app downloads the email from the Apple server, which blocks the receiver’s actions from the email service providers. This way, open rates, geolocation, and other data are affected. Thus, the tracking pixel cannot analyze customer details that are helpful and relevant for personalization.

How Does MPP Affect Email Analytics?

The following are the effects of MPP on email analytics:

Because Apple preloads the tracking pixels on its proxy servers, the open rates will be inflated, resulting in incorrect metrics (such as inaccurate open rates).
Marketers cannot distinguish the percentage of email opens between an actual user and a machine or a bot.
Marketers cannot understand the actual Return on Investment (RoI) of marketing spend.
Marketers will waste the marketing budget when trying to reach out to inactive customers.
It can have an adverse effect on email campaigns centered around geolocation or time-based strategies.
Who Will Be Affected by MPP?

MPP affects any recipient using the native Apple Mail app on:

iOS 15
iPadOS 15
macOS Monterey
watchOS 8

MPP applies to all users who have connected their email account to the Apple Mail app and have opted into the security feature, regardless of email service (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, AOL, and so on). This impact is not constrained to subscribers who receive email at Apple/iCloud/me.com email addresses.

What is the Workaround for the MPP of Apple?

The engagement platform of MoEngage identifies machine opens and differentiates them from authentic user-triggered opens by analyzing the user agent from which a particular open was triggered. MoEngage has introduced metrics such as Adjusted Opens, Adjusted Open Rates, and Adjusted Click to Open Rates, which measure the opens from authentic unique users."
AMP Emails,https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/14078740448148-Email-Glossary,"User Guide 
Campaigns and Channels

Getting Started with Email
Email Glossary
AMP Emails

Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is an open-source project that aims to make the mobile web better by providing a framework for building content pages that consistently load fast.

AMP emails allow senders to include AMP components in the email so the recipients can perform actions like purchase transactions, etc, without leaving the email page.

BIMI

Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) is a technology that is built on top of DMARC and helps brands display their trademark logos in the Inbox. Gmail and Yahoo display a blue check mark for BIMI-enabled senders. It helps build trust in the recipient's mind.

Bounce

Bounce is a delivery failure. If an email is not accepted by the recipient server, it is called a bounce. There can be two types of bounces: soft (temporary and may deliver in the next send) and hard (permanent: The user doesn't exist).

Bulk Email

Emails sent in bulk i.e. as a part of a large group are called Bulk email.

Bulk Email Senders

Email senders who send emails in bulk i.e. who send a high volume of emails are called Bulk senders. Google identifies anyone who sends more than 5k emails per day as a bulk sender.

Daily Peak Sending Volume

This refers to the highest volume you would be sending in a day. This usually applies to new senders during the onboarding/warmup-ramp-up phase.

As such you can consider the highest volume you would be sending during/post ramp-up completion. Peak season volume is not included here.

Dedicated IP

If an IP is reserved for sending emails for just one domain or brand, it is called a dedicated IP.

 

DKIM

Domain Keys Identified Email (DKIM) is an email authentication method designed to detect if an email has been tampered with. DKIM attaches a new domain name identifier to a message and uses cryptographic techniques to validate authorization for its presence.

DMARC

Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) is an email authentication and reporting policy that is built on top of SPF and DKIM. DMARC instructs the ISP on how to handle an email that fails the DKIM and SPF checks. Strict DMARC policies ensure that spammers are unable to impersonate you. DMARC permits three policies.

p=none [means recipient servers can manage the email with DMARC failure as per their own descretion]
p=quarantine [means emails with DMARC failure should be sent to spam/junk]
p-reject [means emails with DMARC failure should be rejected i.e. blocked entirely]

Strict DMARC ""p=reject; sp=reject; pct=100"" prevents spammers from masquerading as you.

Domain 

If your emails are sent from, MyBrand <xyz@anything.mybrand.com>, your from domain would be anything.mybrand.com which is essentially a subdomain of mybrand.com.
In this example, From name is MyBrand, From domain is anything.mybrand.com, From address is xyz@anything.mybrand.com, and friendly from is xyz.

Domain Reputation

This is a value assigned to any domain by recipient servers based on their assessment of emails originating from that domain. A higher or better reputation increases the chances of further emails landing in the inbox. With a lower reputation, there are high chances of emails being placed in spam. Domain reputation is a result of how recipients and recipient sever filters perceive your emails.

Email Deferred

This is a transient state where an email was sent i.e. a delivery attempt was made but it was not delivered or failed. The recipient server responded by saying the server was busy or the IP was rate limited/throttled and retried later. So our system will retry these emails until it is either delivered or failed (bounce).

Email deferral is not the final state of the email. It will either get delivered or bounced with subsequent re-attempts until the pre-configured bounce-after period. The bounce after a period is typically 72 hours for Sendgrid. So after 72 hours of the first delivery attempt, if the email is still in queue, it will be marked as a soft bounce.

Email Deliverability

Email deliverability is the measure of emails that go to recipients' Inboxes. There is no way to calculate email deliverability as recipient servers do not share if they sent the emails to inbox or spam. Proxy indicators of deliverability include Domain and IP reputation, Campaign Performance Metrics (delivered, open, click, complaints, unsubscribe), and Inbox placement rate.

Email Sunsetting

Email sunsetting is the process of suppressing unengaged email addresses. Lack of engagement despite good inbox placement for a period of time - say more than six months - could be because the user has abandoned the mailbox, the mailbox is a spam trap, user no longer wants to interact with the brand. Hence, email sunsetting is used to keep the email list clean.

Email Suppression

This is a list of users who are excluded from receiving emails despite being target users. Typically these are the users who have unsubscribed from your communication, reported your emails as spam, or whose email address does not exist. Repeated soft bounces should also be excluded from sending and should be suppressed.

Feedback Loop

A feedback loop (FBL) or complaint feedback loop is a service offered by ISPs such as Yahoo, Microsoft, Comcast, Mail.ru, etc., wherein you get to apply for Feedback Loops for the IPs or Domains that you manage. In your provided email address [feedback address], the servers then forward the email complaints made by their recipients. The feedback address has to be added and verified during FBL registration.

info	

Information

Google does not share the details of users as a part of FBL. Only spam complaints percentage can be viewed on the Google Postmaster tool if a Feedback ID header is included in your emails while sending.

A feedback loop is a common term. Yahoo calls it a Complaint feedback loop, and Microsoft calls it JMRP (Junk Mail Reporting Program).

Filtered results in SNDS

The Filtered result is the aggregate spam filtering applied to all messages sent from that IP. This might not necessarily mean Inbox v/s Junk percentage as it also depends on individual recipient’s filters and behavior history, but it should be close.

Red: more than 90% of emails were identified as spam
Yellow: 10% to 90% of emails were identified as spam
Green: less than 10% of emails were identified as spam
Folder placement

Gmail has several tabs [Primary, Social, Promotions, Forums], Microsoft has two tabs [Focused and Others], and Apple recently announced they will be introducing tabs by the end of 2024.

Folder placement like Inbox placement is a measure of emails sent to each tab. It, like Inbox placement, can't be calculated in absolute numbers and we can get this vis 3rd party providers like Inbox Monster, eDataSource, Everest (Validity), and the like.

From Email Address

If your emails are sent from, MyBrand <xyz@anything.mybrand.com>, your From email Address would be xyz@anything.mybrand.com.

From Name

If your emails are sent from, MyBrand <xyz@anything.mybrand.com>, your From Name would be MyBrand.

Google Annotations

Email annotations are only relevant to the promotions tab in the Gmail app.

When you annotate emails, Gmail users can view your promotions directly from their inbox. Users can click on the annotated text or image from the Promotions tab to learn more about the promotion, without opening the email.

Hard Bounce

If the bounce is permanent, it's called a hard bounce. It typically happens when the recipient's domain doesn't exist or has been permanently disabled, or the recipient's email address does not exist or has been permanently disabled.

Inbox Placement

Inbox placement is the percentage of emails that are likely to have landed in the recipient's Inbox. Recipient servers do not share this information directly, so there's no way to determine this. However, third-party tools like eDataSource, Inbox Monster, Validity, EmailConsul, Kickbox, and so on., share approximate Inbox placement rates based on the results of Seed Testing.

IP Address

The IP address is the identifier of the email server from where your emails will be sent. These are assigned to your accounts with the ESPs at the time of onboarding.

IP Reputation

This is a value assigned to any IP by the ISPs based on their assessment of emails originating from that IP. A higher or better reputation increases the chances of emails landing in the inbox. With a lower reputation, emails are highly likely to be placed in spam. IP reputation is a result of how recipients and recipient sever filters perceive your emails.

Namespace Mining

Namespace mining is a practice of verifying if email addresses exist without sending (or attempting to send) emails to those addresses. This method is commonly used by malicious senders to generate lists of valid e-mail addresses to which they can send spam, phishing emails, or malware.

For example: pinging the servers with various combinations of common names to identify valid email addresses: johndoe@hotmail.com, johndeooo@hotmail.com, junedoe@hotmail.com, jonnydoe@hotmail.com, etc.

Namespace mining-like patterns may result in your email getting blocked. If you are not involved in namespace mining, check your servers to ensure they were not compromised by a hacker who is using them to attack the recipient’s servers.

Microsoft SNDS shows connection requests made (RCPT commands) v/s actual emails sent (Message recipients). A large gap between these two could be a result of compromised IP. Alternatively, it could also be due to rate-limiting on IPs which causes several retries. However, it can be mistaken by Microsoft as NameSpace mining behavior and might result in blocks.

Phishing

The attempt to steal personal information by presenting a fraudulent copy of a trustworthy identity as bait is called Phishing. Spammers forge sender's addresses and masquerade as a trusted brand to trick end recipients into revealing sensitive information.

Banks, online payment services, and social media accounts are common targets of phishing. These scams are often distributed via email, as well as other vectors.

Pre-Warmed IP

IPs that have an assigned reputation and have already been warmed up to send higher volumes can be called pre-warmed IPs. In the parlance of email campaigns, pre-warmed indicates that you would not need to undertake IP-warming activities.

Pristine Spam Traps

Pristine spam traps are honeypot addresses created specifically to catch spammers/senders who have poor/unsecured user collection methods. As these email addresses never sign up anywhere and are left on the web, anyone scrapping the list can get these users.

Product Carousels

Product carousels display multiple image previews for a promotion. It's an extended version of Annotations for the promotions folder in the Gmail mobile app.

Promotional Emails

Promotional emails are typically sent to inform your customers about new arrivals, offers, sales, and so on. The intent behind a promotional email is to increase awareness about your products/services and engage and retain customers with the eventual goal of generating revenue.

Recycled Spam Traps

Recycled spam traps are addresses that were once valid and owned by real people and may have even signed up on several websites, however, they were inactive for some time post which recipient servers sent a hard bounce response, and sometime after continuously sent hard bounce response, recipient servers converted those address to spam trap to monitor sender’s list quality. Any sender who continuously hits recycled traps is deemed as not following the list management best practices.

Sender Authentication

Sender Authentication is a set of technologies to validate the authenticity of the email i.e. the email sender is who it says it is, the IPs are authorized to send emails for that sender, and the email message has not been tampered with during transit.

Shared IP

If a common IP is used to send emails for more than one domain, it is called a shared IP.

SNDS

Microsoft's Smart Network Data Services (SNDS) gives an insight into the IP reputation at Microsoft similar to how Google postmaster tools share reputation information relevant to Gmail.

Snowshoe Spam

Snowshoe Spamming is a way of avoiding spam filters by spreading emails across various domains and IPs. Even compliance requirements are less stringent for low-volume senders, similarly, spam filters have comparatively low sensitivity for low volumes. That's the loophole the snowshoe technique operates on.

Soft Bounce

If the bounce is temporary, it's called a soft bounce. It typically happens in scenarios where the recipient's mailbox is full, the recipient's mail server is busy, the sender's IPs are blocked, the recipient servers are temporarily unreachable, and so on.

Spam Email

Spam is generally understood to be Unsolicited Bulk E-mail (UBE). However, you can consider any unwanted email as spam.

Spam Reports/Spam Complaints /User Complaints

These indicate users who received the emails in their Inbox and then marked them as spam. For Gmail, you can see this information in the Google Postmaster tool. For other mailbox providers who support traditional feedback loops, this information is available in the campaign analytics.

Spam Traps

Spam Traps are honeypot addresses created/repurposed by Mailbox Providers to access the list management practices of the email senders. Spam Traps addresses are valid and hence emails will be delivered to them. But they never engage with the emails.

Spamhaus

Spamhaus is the trusted authority on IP and domain reputation. Spamhaus is the largest block list. IPs and domains listed on the Spamhaus block list tend to have very low delivery and very high soft bounces. All the major mailbox providers like Gmail, Yahoo, Microsoft, Comcast, etc look at Spamhaus data while determining domain/IP reputation.

SPF

Sender Policy Framework(SPF) is an email authentication method that helps validate if the IP from where the mail has originated is authorized to send emails from that (mailed-by) domain.

Transactional Emails

Transactional emails are typically sent when an action is performed by the user or on the user's account, such as information about purchases, subscriptions, account activity, one-time passwords, invoices, shipping or billing information, and so on.

Unsolicited Email

If emails are sent to users who have not explicitly opted in for it, the email is called unsolicited.

Unsubscribe Drop

This is relevant in the case of email vendor suppression. If an email address exists in the suppression list of the email vendor (SendGrid) and emails are sent to those users from MoEngage, the email will be dropped as an Unsubscribe drop.

Web Scraping or Email Scraping

Email Scraping is a way of collecting email addresses from the web, be it websites, social media platforms, or local HTML documents. There are various tools available that allow you to automate this process and collect users this way.

The users collected this way would not have explicitly given consent to receive emails. This goes against deliverability and user collection best practices. This would also violate policies like GDPR, CASL, etc."

Email Onboarding

This article helps you to understand the different steps to be followed during your email onboarding process.

Prerequisites

Ensure that your target audience is ready for email onboarding. For this to be achieved make sure the below points are followed:

Import your subscribed users in the DB, and make sure this does not include previously opted-out or suppressed users.
Upload your opted-out users in DB with their unsubscribe profile attribute marked as TRUE.
Make sure to complete the website and app SDK integration so that your new users flow directly into MoEngage and real-time events are available.
Note that you can send emails without completing the website and app SDK integration. However, if you have never sent emails before, ensure that the integration is completed.
This is applicable for both MoEngage Sender and Other Email Sender.
Steps for Email Onboarding
Choose Your Domain

Both MoEngage Email Sender and Other Email Sender should ensure that they follow the below point while choosing the domain.

Make sure that the email sending domain (from domain) is the subdomain of your website domain. For example, if the website domain is https://www.example.com/ then the from domain is anything.example.com.
You must choose the sub-domain you want to use. If you own the website, you can create or configure subdomains without incurring any additional costs.
info	

Information

Getting Started with Email
Configure a Deep Linking Domain
Overview

Deep links are specific URLs that can directly point to specific content within a mobile app instead of the app's homepage.
Deep linking allows an app to be accessed and launched from a URL. When a user clicks a deep link, they are directed to a specific location within the app rather than opening it to its homepage. This could be a specific page, feature, or content within the app. Thus, deep linking provides a more personalized user experience and can guide users toward specific actions, enhancing user engagement and conversion rates.

Advantages
Enhanced user experience: Deep linking eliminates users' need to navigate multiple screens to find what they are looking for, boosting engagement and satisfaction.
Promote app installations: Deep linking can promote app installations. You can create customized links that take users directly to the app store with pre-populated information, making the installation process smoother and more convenient.
Retargeting and re-engagement: Deep links facilitate retargeting strategies by reminding them of products or services they showed interest in. This helps increase user engagement and conversions.
Personalized campaigns: You can create personalized campaigns by leveraging deep linking. By directing users to specific pages related to their interests or personal preferences, you can tailor campaigns to individual users, increasing the chances of conversion.
Configure Deep Linking Domain in MoEngage

Perform the following steps to configure a deep linking domain in MoEngage:

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, go to Settings > Advanced settings > Custom domain.
On the Email tab, click + Add deep linking domain.

On the Add deep linking domain side drawer, add the following details:


Complete the deep linking configuration of your respective provider. For more information, refer to the following links. MoEngage supports native integration from the following deep link providers:

AppsFlyer
Branch

info	

Information

Ensure that you follow instructions from your deep link provider regarding the CNAME pointing.
MoEngage does not procure an SSL certificate for your deep linking domain. Your deep link provider can help you with this.
If you utilize other providers for deep link shortening, it is crucial to deactivate click tracking for these particular links to guarantee their proper functionality. To achieve this, add the attribute 'clicktracking=off' to the anchar tag that has the deep link URL. For example, to turn off clicktracking for a deep link, the HTML would look like the below:
<a clicktracking = ""off"" href = ""Insert_your_Deeplink"">Click Here </a>
By implementing this parameter, click tracking will be exclusively disabled for the modified link within the MoEngage platform. However, the deep link will remain fully operational. Additionally, the click data associated with these links will be accessible through your chosen Email Service Provider (ESP) dashboard, allowing for continued monitoring and analysis of link engagement.
To ensure proper click tracking for the provided links, it is essential that the setup on the Email Service Provider (ESP) dashboard is executed accurately. The data must be actively posted to MoEngage. It is important to note that MoEngage does not perform link wrapping and, therefore, cannot directly monitor click activity. Instead, MoEngage depends on deep-linking providers to transmit the relevant click data back to the platform.
In the Deeplinking domain name box, type the deep linking domain name with which you want to wrap the deep links.
Select the Mark this domain as default check box if you want this domain as your default domain.
Select the I acknowledge that the pre-requisites are met and click tracking ESP settings is turned off check box.

info	

Information

 

Keeping the ESP setting turned on breaks the redirection when the recipient clicks the deep links received in their mailboxes. If you are using MoEngage-managed email, MoEngage handles this. If you are using your Email Service Provider (ESP), ensure the same on your ESP dashboard.

Click Save.
After saving, your deep linking domain is listed on the Email tab of the Custom domain page as shown below:

Click the ellipsis icon () against any of your deep linking domains to mark it as Default or Delete. 

If you have only one default link brand domain configured and delete the same, you cannot add this branding domain while creating the email campaign.
If you have configured multiple default link branding domains and delete one, any active campaign that uses the deleted link branding domain falls back to the new default link branding domain.
Add Deep Linking Domain to Email Campaign

After configuring the deep linking domain, you can add them to your email campaigns. Perform the following steps to add deep link domains while creating email campaigns:

Navigate to Step 2: Content of your email campaign.
In the Deeplinking domain list, select the deep linking domain to be used in this email campaign so that MoEngage wraps the deep links with this domain while sending out the email campaign. Note that any deep links marked as default during configuration are auto-populated in this list.


info	

Information

 

When creating the email content, adding the parameter deep_link=true to all deep linking URLs included in the email body is necessary. This allows the MoEngage platform to identify these links as deep links. The system then uses the deep linking domain chosen from the Deeplinking domain list to wrap them. All remaining URLs in the email body are wrapped with the selected link branding domain.

Continue to add the required details and publish the campaign. For more information, refer to Create an Email Campaign.
View the Deep Linking Domain Used in a Campaign

Perform the following steps to view the deep linking domain used in a published email campaign:

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
On the All campaigns page, select the required campaign.
On the Campaign analytics and info page, click the Info tab.
In the Sender details section, you can view the deep linking domain added to that email campaign.

info	

Information

Even if your brand does not use deep links, MoEngage recommends branding your links using its link branding feature. For more information, refer to Configure Custom Domain."

Types of Email Campaigns
One-Time

One-time campaigns allow you to send messages to your audience once—either immediately or at a scheduled time. These are generic batch and blast campaigns.

For example, when there are changes in the regulations or guidelines or the terms of services, the brand can send a one-time communication (blast) to its users.

Periodic

Periodic campaigns allow you to send messages to your audience on a recurring basis at a defined frequency. You can schedule daily/weekly/monthly periodic campaigns. Use correct exclusions and templates to ensure the same campaign is not sent multiple times to the same user.

For example, any communication sent to a customer that is both transactional and regular/periodic in nature such as monthly bills, monthly account statements.

Event-Triggered

Event-triggered campaigns allow you to send messages to your audience that are triggered based on different user actions/events tracked on the app or server. These campaigns enable you to trigger personalized emails to your users based on their actions. You can target users at the right moment and in the right context.

For example, when someone purchases an item, a transaction occurs. This 'event' can be configured to trigger a campaign to send an email pertaining to this transaction.

The following are some use cases you can achieve with event-triggered email campaigns:

Order confirmation email after a purchase
Email to re-engage Funnel drop-offs (cart drop-offs, subscription drop-offs, payment drop-offs, and so on)
Business Event-Triggered

Business event-triggered campaigns allow you to send messages that are triggered based on any defined business event. These campaigns are triggered campaigns or one-time campaigns. You can select the business event to be mapped to the campaign. Once the business event is selected, the event attributes associated with the business event are available in the segmentation filters.

Business Events allow marketers to create events that are based on business actions rather than user actions and run campaigns when these events occur. 

For example, a Back in Stock campaign is based on when the brand has refilled its commodity stock and wishes to communicate it to its customers. Thus, the event or action here happens at the brand's end, and Business Events help businesses create such events in MoEngage.

Flows

MoEngage Flows is a powerful cross-platform omnichannel marketing tool that helps marketers provide a comprehensive customer experience across multiple channels and drive customer engagement.

A Flow is a tool that helps you create multi-channel user journeys and track all users’ actions across multiple platforms. As part of a Flow, you can use the email channel (in conjunction with other channels) to engage users. 

For example, an e-commerce website users have added products to their cart but have not purchased them yet. A marketer wishes to engage with customers who have viewed their cart at least once and nudge them to purchase the products in their carts.

The following is the marketer’s plan of action:

Wait for 24 hours and then send a push notification (EngageCartAbandonedUsers) to the users in this target segment.
In case the users have received the Push notification, check for the users who have viewed the notification and clicked it.
For the user segment that has clicked on the notification, evaluate whether they have made a purchase. If they have not, send them an SMS with a 20% discount coupon code. For the user segment that has ignored the notification, send another push notification (RetryPush20%Off) and offer a 20% discount.
Wait for 36 hours and send an email to the customers who have received the SMS but have not made a purchase.
Wait for 10 days and end the campaigns.

Like this, you can schedule various communications (Emails and/or others) in Flows. For more information, refer to Flows.

Inform

MoEngage Inform facilitates a unified messaging infrastructure across multiple channels using a single API to build and manage transactional alerts.

You can use the email channel to send transactional alerts. For more information, refer to Overview - Inform.

The following are examples of transactional alerts that marketers can send through emails:

Order/Booking/Purchase confirmations and pertinent updates
Shipping/Delivery confirmations and applicable updates
Password resets
One-time password (OTP)"

Prerequisites

Before you start creating email campaigns, make sure you have configured email settings.

To create an Email campaign, perform the following steps:

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard.
From the left navigation, use one of the following options:
Click Engage > Campaigns. The All campaigns page is displayed. At the top right corner, click + Create campaign. The Create campaign page is displayed.

Click Create New > Campaign. The Campaign page is displayed.

Under Outbound, click Email and select one of the following campaign delivery types:

For more information about delivery types, refer to Delivery Types.
The Email creation page is displayed.

Steps to Create an Email Campaign

The following are the steps to create an Email campaign:

Target users: Define the target audience for the campaign.
Content: Define the content of the Email campaign to be sent.
Schedule and Goals: Define the campaign's delivery schedule and goals.
Step 1: Target Users

This section contains the following:

Campaign Details

The campaign details section contains the following fields:

Teams: If your organization has teams enabled, select a team in the drop-down list. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage.
Campaign Name: Enter the name of the campaign to manage and identify the campaign. The campaign name must have at least five characters, and the limit is 256.
Campaign tags: Campaign tags are used to provide context about the campaigns and describe the nature of the campaign or the campaign's central theme. Select campaign tags from the drop-down list. You can select a maximum of five tags. For more information, refer to Campaign Tags.
Campaign Content Type: There are two types of campaigns that you can send using MoEngage, and they are promotional and transactional. For more information, refer to Promotional Campaigns vs. Transactional Campaigns.

Subscription Categories: Subscription categories are a means to help users choose the type of communication they receive from your brand. They can be configured in the Email Channel settings. For more information, refer to subscription categories.

You can choose a subscription category for your email campaign using this field. This would help you target only those users who have opted-in to receive communication about a specific category. For example, a travel company could have recommendations, updates, and deals as subscription categories. To email users who have opted to receive communication about recommendations, choose the subscription category in this field.
This is a mandatory field when subscription categories are enabled. However, if subscription categories are enabled and no categories have been added yet or all the categories have been archived or disabled, this field will not be available in the Target Users step of email campaign creation.
Once you have started collecting preferences from the user, make sure you respect those preferences. Sending an email from a category that the user has not subscribed to may result in fines and also jeopardize the relationship with the user.
How does Subscription Category affect reachability?
The Subscription Category acts as an additional filter for the target audience chosen. For example, if a user is present in the Target Audience and if they have not opted to receive recommendations from the brand, they will be removed from the target audience list.
User attribute with email address: This field indicates the user attribute that stores the email address. When configuring the email channel, the user attribute that stores the email address is configured in the General Settings.
The attribute configured in the settings is selected in the User attribute with email address by default. You can override the same at the campaign level by selecting another attribute (from the dropdown)that contains the email address.

If you selected the Double Opt-in method in the Subscription management > Opt-in management tab of your email settings, the Send to only double opted in users toggle appears while creating the email campaign and is turned on by default. Note that this toggle appears only when the Campaign Content type is Promotional/Marketing. For more information, refer to Opt-in management.
When this toggle is on, MoEngage filters out previously unsubscribed users, hard-bounced users, and users whose opt-in status is not Double Opt-in. The campaign is then sent to the remaining group of users.
When this toggle is off, you can send campaigns to every user regardless of their opt-in status. This means that even though the opt-in status attribute exists for every user, MoEngage ignores its value and filters out only previously unsubscribed and hard-bounced users. The campaign is then sent to the remaining group of users, considering unsubscription settings and subscription categories.

Select Audience

This section contains segmentation filters that help you choose the target audience for your campaign. The following options are available:

All Users
Filter by User Property
Filter by User Behavior
Filter by User Affinity
Filter by Custom Segment

This filter option allows you to send the campaign to all the app users. When you use this option, you cannot add multiple filters.

If teams are enabled for your account, you will be able to see the custom segments created by your team. The segmentation criteria specified for the team for which you are creating the campaign will get appended to the segmentation filters with an AND condition. For example, if the segmentation criteria for your team is the set of users whose last known city is Los Angeles and you have selected users who've purchased a product within the last three days as the target audience for your campaign, your target audience would be users who have purchased a product within the last three days and whose last known city is Los Angeles. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage.

Information

This is an add-on feature. Please contact your MoEngage CSM (customer success manager) or the Support team to enable it for your account.

After selecting the filter criteria, you can do the following as well:

Create Multiple Filters: You can create and combine multiple user property rules, user activity rules, and custom segment rules to create a complex user segment using this option.
Click + Filter.
Click AND or OR.
Select the attribute or event and define the filter conditions.
Exclude Users: Select this checkbox to define the filter criteria for users to be excluded from the campaign. For more information, refer to Preference Management.
Reset filters: Click this option to reset the segmentation filters.
Show count: Click this button to display the total number of users who are currently in the configured segment.

Campaign Audience Limit

This feature empowers you to control campaign reach and expenditure by capping the number of users who receive it based on engagement metrics like sends, impressions, and conversions. It allows you to set total, daily, or instance-level limits to campaigns. For more information, refer to Campaign Audience Limit.

Control Groups

This section contains information about control groups for the campaign. Control Groups are enabled only for promotional campaigns. They are not applicable for transactional campaigns. You can enable the control groups to which you want to send the promotional campaign.

In the Control groups section:

Turn the Global control group toggle on to not send the campaign to all the users in the control group
Turn the Campaign control group toggle on to not send the particular campaign to the control group.

For more information, refer to Control Group.

	

Click Next or use the tabs at the top of the create campaign navigation to move to Step 2 Content.

Step 2: Content

To create email content you can choose between Drag and drop editor (either blank or pre-built WYSIWYG templates), and Custom HTML editor where you can upload your templates in HTML format or previously saved templates under My saved templates after you have saved your created templates. You can also import custom templates and template groups. For more information, refer to Import and Use Template Groups in Email Content.

After you select a template, on the next screen, you can enter email credentials and edit the content as follows:


Sender Details
Personalization in Emails

You can personalize the following:

Email Subject: Personalizing the subject using the customer's name or their topic of interest can help you get more opens and clicks. Choose the user attribute to personalize in the personalization editor.
From email address
Reply-to email address: When a customer, lead, or prospect replies to your email, the reply-to email address should be directed to the relationship manager or personnel handling them rather than to a static or generic email address. You can do so by personalizing the Reply-to email address. Select the user attribute that stores the email address of the relationship manager for the customer in the personalization editor.
Sender Name: Personalizing your sender name helps you optimize your open rate, click-through rate, and conversions. For instance, the sender name could be your brand name or could be xyz from BrandName. Such sender names make your brand more personable and result in higher open rates.
Email Content (including any URLs) 
CC and BCC
Custom Domain: Customizing your domain increases open rates as the recipients are likely to trust and open an email coming from a familiar domain. For more information, refer Configure Custom Domain.
Deep linking Domain: Deep linking your domain allows for a smoother and more direct user experience. Deep linking allows an app to be accessed and launched from a URL. For more information, refer to Configure Deeplinking Domain.

Type ""@"" and select among the list of user attributes. You will also need to select a fallback mechanism that applies when a personalization attribute is missing for a user. Read more about personalizing emails here.

info	

Note

The Sender Name should be less than 320 characters while using Amazon SES (as it supports only up to 320 characters). When the Sender Name exceeds this limit, Test Campaigns will result in a ""Transaction failed: Address length is more than 320 characters long"" error, and published campaigns that send out emails will experience SMTPDataError.
The personalized Sender Name will be sent as plain text. For example, if a link gets added as part of personalization, the link will be treated and sent as text instead of being treated as a URL.
 
Attachments

You can attach one or more files as part of the message in the email campaigns. For more information, refer to Add File Attachments to Email.

Gmail annotation

Gmail annotations help customers conveniently view and engage with your promotions from their inboxes. For more information, refer to Gmail Annotations.

Preview Text

Preview text is the text that appears below the subject line in the inbox. Preview text can help you connect with your users and increase your open rate. If you do not specify the preview text, the email clients pull the first line of test from the email content and display the preview text in the inbox (this may not be as appealing to the user as you writing the purpose of your email succinctly). In the Sender details section, you can add the preview text in the Preview Text field.

For example, if you were to add the following in the Sender Details:

Subject - Let Your Summer Look Shine!

Preview text - Summer Sale - Infuse freshness in your wardrobe with our latest offerings.

The message would appear in the inbox as shown below.

Note: It is recommended to keep your preview text within 40 - 130 characters so that it looks ideal across email clients and devices. If the preview text exceeds the character limit, it will be shown only up to the maximum character limit in the inbox. If the preview text is too short (falls short of the lower limit of 40 characters), MoEngage will add an adequate number of non-breaking spaces (approx 100) to ensure that the preview text length is compatible with all devices.

From email address

Select a ""from"" email address from the drop-down. If you do not see any email addresses in the drop-down, it is likely that you have not added/verified ""from"" email addresses in email settings.

While selecting a ""from"" email address, you can see the current reputation of each domain. For more information, refer to Domain Reputation.

Other options

There are additional options to:

Throttling is a feature that allows you to control the sending rate of an email campaign.

ISPs place rate limits on IPs or domains from their end based on IP/domain reputation and the sending pattern of the marketers. Normally, there is an upper limit for volumes originating from an IP. Throttling helps prevent exceeding these limits, which could result in deferrals/blocks/reputation drops, especially while sending high-volume campaigns and/or scaling up the volume.

Select the Throttle limit in the Request limit section. For more information, refer to Throtlling.

Next Steps

If you have successfully created the campaign, you will be taken to the Analytics page. For more information, refer to Email Campaign Analytics."

Create Content with the Drag and Drop Editor
Getting Started

The Drag and Drop editor is divided into two main areas: the main message editing section on the left, and the properties panel on the right. In general, you will be dragging and dropping content elements onto the stage and then editing their properties.

You have the following options available when you create content using the drag-and-drop editor:

Dark mode preview
This option allows you to preview your content in the dark mode. The generated preview is an approximation and can vary with devices and the ISP.
Switch to HTML editor
This option allows you to switch to the HTML editor and create content using it. Once switched, you cannot revert to the drag-and-drop editor. For more information, refer to Edit/Paste HTML template.



Preview
This option allows you to preview the created content. You can preview the Subject line, Preview text, Sender Name, From email address, and Reply-to email address.


 

Properties Panel

The properties panel is divided into the following sections:

CONTENT
ROWS
SETTINGS
CONTENT

The CONTENT tab allows you to choose a new content element and add it to your message. Drag and drop a content element (a button, an image, a text block, a transparent or solid divider, social media sharing) in the message area on the left.

TEXT
 

If you click inside a text content block, the text editor toolbar appears directly on the editing stage. It gives you access to a number of text editing tools: font family, font size, basic formatting, text alignment, numbered and non-numbered bullets, font color, links.

info	

Information

If you set the font family to Global Font, it will inherit the font family selected under the SETTINGS tab. This allows you to change the font family for multiple elements at once by changing that property in the SETTINGS tab.

Add Links


Links can be added by selecting the text and clicking on the Insert/edit option: 

The 'Insert link' pop-up window is displayed which allows the user to give the link details:

Add Personalized Links

Personalized links can be added using the More >> Links. This will open a pop-up window where the user can access and select from a list of personalized attributes (User profile attributes and Event attributes).

 
IMAGE

How to Insert an Image?

Images can be inserted using the File manager. The editor includes a built-in file manager. The file manager is the component that you will use to browse, search, and select the images and documents that you wish to use in your email message. With the handy file manager you can:

Browse, search, and sort existing files
Switch between list and grid view
Import new files
Create new folders
Preview and insert images into your message
How Does It Look?

The file manager opens over the editor, covering the entire working area. This allows you to browse your files without worrying about your screen size or resolution. 

The top section has actions and navigation helpers, with most of the space used to list your files and the information you need to work with them. By default, folders and images are shown in the Grid view. If you switch to List view, it will be used next time you open the File Manager. Here is an example of images within a folder, in the Grid view:

And here is the same folder, in the List view.

How to Access It?

The file manager will load in several scenarios.

When you click Browse in an image placeholder, which is displayed when you drag and drop an image content block into a message.

When you click Change image in the image properties panel:


When you click Link file when working with images and buttons:


How to Upload Files?

The quickest way to upload a file into the file manager is to drag it from your computer to the file manager window, dropping it anywhere on the page.

You can also

Browse and upload from your computer using the Upload.
Import from an external application using the Import button (see more below), if this feature has been enabled.
Search and import free stock photos using the Search free photos button, if this feature has been enabled.

Note that the maximum allowed file size that can be uploaded is 5 MB.

How to Import Files from Other Applications

The Import feature allows you to connect external applications such as DropBox, Google Drive, Instagram, and more, and import your files. 

How to Browse or Search Files

To locate your desired image or document, browse your folders and order their content by name, date, size or type by clicking the sort labels on top of the list.

An arrow icon next to this labels means that this is the current filter, and its orientation shows the order, ascending or descending.

Too many files in the selected folder? Click the lens icon to run a search. Results are filtered on the fly. Mind that this search is performed only in the current folder, and not in your entire repository.

How to Use Files?

When you move your cursor over a file or folder, that row will be highlighted and the available action icons will be shown on the right side:

Preview for files
Delete for both files and folders

If an action is momentary not available, you are notified by the tooltip text of the icon, such as when you try to delete a folder that contains files, because only empty folders can be deleted.

If you want to delete multiple files or folders, use the check boxes to select them, the delete action is shown on top of the list. Only elements that can be deleted will have a selectable check box.

How to Organise Folders?

You can create the folder structure you prefer to organise your files. To add new folders, use the Add folder icon.

For your folder names you can use letters (upper and lower case), numbers, spaces, periods (.), hyphens (-), or underscores (_).

To navigate to the parent folder, use the top breadcrumb. Clicking the home icon takes you to your root folder.

How Does the Image Editor Work?
Edit Images

The email editor includes an image editor that allows you to crop, rotate, resize, apply filters/frames, add stickers to any image, without leaving the editor.

 

Accessing the Image Editor

When you select an image in the editor, the Apply effects & more button is displayed. Click it to have access to a tool that allows you to edit the image in a variety of ways.

The editor has a lot of cool features, from filters to resizing and cropping tools.

 

You can quickly and easily change the image size.

 

There are also a number of predefined filters that can help you very quickly change the look of the image.

 

 DYNAMIC CONTENT

You can use the dynamic content block to add a personalized image:

Select the dynamic block and click Add Option.

Enter the details of the personalized image in the Personalized Content pop-up window.


Enter the personalized attribute in the Image Source URL field.
Enter the target link in the Target URL field.
info	

Note

After a Dynamic Content block is added, it cannot be edited or previewed in the WYSIWYG editor. You can delete an existing block and create a new one in case of edits.

HTML

The HTML block allows you to add your HTML code to an email message that you are designing with the editor. 

How to Add an HTML Code?

To add your code, drag an HTML content element into your message. It can be positioned alone, with other HTML content items, or mixed with other types of content.

The newly-inserted content block displays some default placeholder text. Click it and the right-side property panel displays the HTML code editing pane. You will find some placeholder code inside the editing area:

Paste your HTML code or write it directly in the editing area. The system highlights your syntax and indent your code to make it more readable.

Note: Using your code may affect how the message is rendered in email clients, preventing it from adjusting to the screen size (that is, the ""responsiveness"" of the message). Make sure to use HTML that is email compliant and responsive.

Which HTML Tags Are Allowed?

The HTML content will automatically correct some issues like HTML tags that are left open, and strip out code that cannot be used, such as script tags or iframe tags (this code tags are not allowed by the major part of email clients, can cause deliverability problems or security risks).

List of Allowed Tags

<a>, <abbr>, <acronym>, <address>, <area>, <b>, <bdo>, <big>, <blockquote>, <button>, <caption>, <center>, <cite>, <code>, <colgroup>, <dd>, <del>, <dfn>, <dir>, <div>, <dl>, <dt>, <em>, <fieldset>, <font>, <form>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <i>, <ins>, <kbd>, <label>, <legend>, <li>, <map>, <menu>, <ol>, <optgroup>, <option>, <p>, <pre>, <q>, <s>, <samp>, <select>, <small>, <span>, <strike>, <strong>, <sub>, <sup>, <table>, <tbody>, <td>, <textarea>, <tfoot>, <th>, <thead>, <u>, <tr>, <tt>, <u>, <ul>, <var>

VIDEO

The video content block allows you to share your video content in your emails. You need to copy and paste the URL of your video from YouTube or Vimeo, and the editor will do the rest: it will automatically grab the cover image for the video, overlay a Play icon on top of it, and link it to the video content.

The Content properties section prompts you to provide a video URL from YouTube or Vimeo, the popular video hosting services that we currently support. After you insert a valid URL, the content block in the editing panel displays the cover image for the video with a Play icon overlaid on top of it. You can edit the type, color, and size of the Play icon to change the way it looks. Note that the editor cannot access password-protected videos to get the cover image.

info	

Information

This feature does not embed the actual video in the email but rather links to it in a smart way.
The reason why the actual video content is not embedded into the message is that, it doesn't work very well. Many email clients do not support it.
Additionally, many emails are opened on mobile devices, and viewing videos on a mobile device can cause substantial data usage in addition to a poor user experience due to the quality of the data connection.
ICONS

The Icons block allows you to use small images and text together in a single content block to provide more flexibility in your designs.

How to Add an Icon Collection?

Click Add new Icon in the Content properties section of the editor sidebar to add the first icon for your collection. Then, click Change image to select an image from the file manager.

Click More options to create an accompanying section of text that you can position on the top, bottom, left, or right of the icon.

From this panel, you may also add a link for the icon and the image's alternate text. If you need to reorder the collection, drag the icon box in the content properties area.

For more design inspiration in using icons, visit the BEE editor blog post on using icons in emails.

MENU

The Menu block allows you to add a text-based Navigation element.

Perform the following steps to add menu items:

Click Add new item in the Content properties section of the editor sidebar.
Define the properties for each element for the menu item.


You can also reorder menu items by dragging the icon found to the left of the menu item title.
You can also configure the menu item as a mobile menu. This option is only applicable for mobile devices and When turned on, a “hamburger” menu will be applied on mobile. It can be expanded with a tap to reveal menu items in a vertical layout.


info	

Information

Mobile menus are not compatible with all email clients.

For more information on how to use the Menu block, visit the BEE editor article on Adding Menu.

ROWS

The ROWS panel includes different types of structural elements for your message. They allow you to create different sections of the message.

Selecting a row will switch the properties panel to the row and column settings. The editor provides flexibility and customization at both the row and column levels.

Save a Row

This option allows you to save a row and reuse it in other templates. This option can be very handy while handling repetitive content such as template headers or footers

Perform the following steps  to save a row:

Select the row that you want to save and click Save.
Enter a unique row name and select from one of the pre-defined categories. The saved rows can be found under ROWS in the respective category.
info	

Note

Multiple saved rows cannot have the same name. Saved Rows need to have unique names.

 

Create Rows with Product Set-Based Personalization

This option allows you to create rows with product blocks. A product block is a group of product attributes such as product image, product price, and so on. For more information, refer to Personalize Content Using Recommendations.

info	

Information

The prerequisite for this feature is creating a Product set. Refer to this link for more information.

Undo Widget

When enabled, the UNDO feature allows you to rewind and fast-forward to any point in your recent edit history. When changes are detected, a compact Undo widget displays in the bottom left corner of the stage (see annotation below):

 

Timeline Widget

The timeline allows you to browse through the most recent changes. The widget displays:

An icon to identify the content element type (an image, text, and so on)
A description of what changed, giving the new property value (if any)
The exact time it happened

These details help determine what modification was applied and allow the user to reset to an earlier version of the message.

The Undo widget currently displays the last 15 edits in the timeline, but you can always rewind to the Message Opened state to undo all changes since the message was initially opened in the editor.

Hide Content on Desktop or Mobile

Hide on feature is available for both the content level and the row level. You can now hide individual content blocks or entire rows from a specific type of device.

For example:

Content displayed on desktop	Content displayed on mobile
	

Do the following:

Navigate to Property Panel.
Scroll down to Block options settings

In Hide on, select Desktop or Mobile.


You can check the result by navigating to the Preview and selecting the Mobile view.

Hide Rows

To hide a larger portion of your design, hide an entire row instead. 

Select the row you want to hide.
Navigate to Row Properties.
In Hide on, select Desktop or Mobile.

SETTINGS

From the SETTINGS tab, you can modify general settings that apply to the entire message:

Content area width: This is the width of the area where content blocks are dropped. According to email marketing best practices, it should typically be set to 600px or less. Note that this is the maximum width that will be used on larger devices. When the device’s screen is smaller, the message will adjust automatically to it.
Background color: It is the background color for the message. This setting is effective only for rows (and columns) where color has not been specified. Otherwise, the background color specified for that content structure will be used.
Content area background color: It is the background color for the content area. This setting is effective only for rows and columns where color has not been specified.
Default font: It is the default font that will be used when another font family has not been specified. This setting affects all text set to use the global font.
Link color: It is the link color. As above, this setting affects all text links set to use the default color."

Import and Use Template Groups in Email Content
Overview - Template Groups

As a marketer, you may want to create multi-locale, multi-variant email campaigns at times. For example, if you want to run a campaign for 20 locales with two variants  each, you have to add content for 40 combinations. These 40 combinations are related to each other because they have the same message to be conveyed. It is common for such templates to be created together and be published in a campaign together.

MoEngage allows you to create Template Groups by passing the locale, variant, and group_id parameters in the Create Email Template API. For more information, refer to Create Email Template API.

The Template Groups feature allows you to import template groups into the MoEngage ecosystem and renders the mapped templates together. While creating an email campaign, when you go to Step 2 Content and the Imported templates tab, you can see template groups that you have created using the Create Email Template API. When you select a template group, MoEngage automatically populates content for all locale and variation combinations. This feature saves you time because you need not add templates manually for all locale and variant combinations. In the above example of 40 combinations, it takes just one click to populate all of the relevant content.

Create and Push a Template Group to MoEngage

If you create your content outside of MoEngage, for example, in some Content Management System (CMS), you can push it into MoEngage using our Create Email Template API. If you have a use case to run multi-locale campaigns and/or want to conduct A/B testing, you can pass the locale, variant, and group_id parameters in the API. This enables association of individual templates into a template group.

Preview a Template Group
In Step 2 (Content) of the email campaign creation journey, you can find these templates/template groups on the Imported templates tab. A template group can be identified with a badge indicating the total number of variations in the template group.

Hover the mouse on the thumbnail to see the Preview icon.
Click the Preview icon. The Preview template pop-up is displayed. You can see the preview of each template based on its locale and variation.

From the Locales and Variations drop-down lists, select the required values to see the associated template. If a locale does not have a variation, the Variations drop-down list is unavailable.
Click Choose and Continue to add this template group to the email campaign. All templates in the group will get added to the campaign automatically.
Add a Template Group to Email Campaigns
In Step 2 Content, go to the Imported templates tab. 
Hover the mouse on the thumbnail of the required template group.
Click the template group to add it to the email campaign. MoEngage automatically creates all locales and all variations within locales, and populates the same on the Step 2 Content page. 

MoEngage keeps the number of variations consistent across all locales in the template group. If some locales do not have variations, MoEngage adds blank variations in those locales. In that case, the following warning is displayed:

MoEngage adds warning icons for locales and variations to help you quickly identify that there are blank variations where you must add content.

Add CC and BCC to Email

CC (Carbon copy) and BCC (Blind carbon copy) are used in emails to copy recipients who are not part of the chosen target segment. When this feature is enabled, the CC/BCC recipients will receive the exact copy of the message that the main recipient receives ('To' field)

Example use cases

E-commerce/Travel/Hotel brands send email campaigns to sellers copying the respective account managers.

Banks copy the customer relationship manager while communicating with premium customers.

Adding CC/BCC recipients

In the second step of Email campaign creation(Content section), click CC or BCC or both to add CC/BCC email recipients to a campaign. You can add static addresses or personalized email addresses, as explained below.

Add static Cc/ Bcc addresses - every email will have the same set of Cc/Bcc recipients
Add personalized CC/BCC addresses  - the CC/BCC email addresses will be fetched from the personalized attribute 

To personalize the CC/BCC, type '@' and click on the Click to personalize button (that appears on typing '@' in the Cc and Bcc fields) to insert the personalized CC/BCC email attribute.

Impact of adding CC/BCC on Click and Suppression Tracking
Connector	Stats Tracking	Suppression Tracking
Sendgrid	

Open and click tracking for CC/BCC recipients are not captured in campaign stats. If you create an email campaign targeting 100 recipients along with one CC recipient, then the campaign stats will only have the open and click tracking data from the main recipients of the campaign.

	
Whenever a CC/BCC recipient unsubscribes or reports an email as spam, the CC/BCC recipient will be added to the suppression list and will not be considered in the subsequent campaigns. However, this will not affect the main recipient of the campaign.
Whenever a CC/BCC recipient encounters a bounce, the email will be delivered to the main recipient in the first instance. This will not affect the main recipient of the campaign.

Non-Sendgrid	

Open and Click tracking for CC/ BCC recipients are attributed to the engagement data of the main recipient. If you create an email campaign targeting 100 recipients along with one CC recipient, then the campaign stats for opens/clicks will be the sum of the opens/clicks from the CC/BCC recipients and the main recipients.

	
Whenever a CC/BCC recipient unsubscribes or reports an email as spam, the corresponding main recipient will be added to the suppression list and not considered in the subsequent campaigns.
Whenever a CC/BCC recipient encounters a bounce, the email will be delivered to the main recipient in the first instance. However, the main recipient will be added to the suppression list and will be suppressed from the subsequent campaigns.
Viewing the CC/BCC recipients for campaigns

Add GIFs to Emails
Advantages 

Incorporating GIFs into an email campaign can offer several advantages:

Visual Appeal: GIFs add a dynamic and engaging element to your emails, making them more visually attractive.
Increased Engagement: The motion in GIFs can catch the reader's attention and potentially lead to increased engagement rates, as recipients may be more inclined to pay attention to your message.
Convey Emotion: GIFs can effectively convey emotions or reactions, adding a human touch to your emails that plain text or static images cannot match.
Explain Concepts: Complex ideas or products can be illustrated more clearly using GIFs. These quickly show how something works without requiring the recipient to leave the email.
How to Add GIFs?

Consider the following methods while adding GIFs to your emails:

GIF Drag and Drop: You can source GIFs from platforms like Giphy and conveniently search them on MoEngage GIFs after dragging and dropping.

Image block usage: Alternatively, you can utilize the image block and provide the GIF's URL for insertion.

Best Practices

Incorporating GIFs in email communications demands careful consideration of the following key factors:

GIF aspect ratio and size: The GIF's aspect ratio and dimensions must be selected precisely. Oversized images may not load adequately.
Loading speed and subscriber engagement: The speed at which your email and its contents load is crucial. Slower loading times can reduce your recipients' engagement.
File size: Although no universal threshold exists for the maximum GIF size in an email, larger files take longer to load. Aim for GIFs under 200 KB to ensure smoother loading, especially for mobile users.
Mobile network considerations: Given that most users access emails on their smartphones, it's essential to account for varying mobile network speeds, even though many can connect to Wi-Fi.
Overall email size: Emails must ideally stay within the 100 KB range, with a maximum limit of 110 KB. Exceeding this limit, especially in Gmail, results in message clipping. Note that the media size does not significantly contribute to the email size; the HTML code and wrapped links affect it.
Recommended image size: For images, it is recommended to use an image size below 500 KB. Since GIFs often have larger file sizes, it's wise to set an upper limit of around 800 KB.
Acceptable Download Speeds: Ensure that your email's content, including GIFs, loads swiftly on different connections:
3G connection: Less than 4 seconds
4G connection: Less than 3 seconds
LTE connection: Less than 2.5 seconds
Desktop connection: Less than 2 seconds"

Gmail Annotations
Overview

Gmail annotations help customers conveniently view and engage with your promotions from their inboxes. Annotating emails enhances the content of your emails within the Promotions folder by incorporating elements like images, deals, and expiration dates from which customers can directly access the information without opening the emails. You can annotate emails to display the following features in the Promotions tab of Gmail:

Deal Annotations
Product Carousel
info	

Information

This feature applies to recipients who use Gmail as their mailbox provider.
This feature applies only to emails in the Promotions tab of Gmail.
This feature works only for personal email IDS and not Google Workspace accounts.
Deal Annotations are rendered for all users on mobile and desktop devices.
The Product Carousel is rendered only on the mobile app, and its rendering depends on various factors determined by Google. For more information, refer to the Prerequisite section.
Due to limitations around personalization, the click tracking of promo URLs is not supported.
Advantages of Email Annotations

Annotating emails in email campaigns can offer several advantages:

Enhanced visual appeal: Annotations allow the incorporation of elements like images, making the emails more visually engaging and captivating for recipients.
Better interaction: Annotations enable your customers to interact with promotions directly from their inbox, promoting higher engagement and action, such as clicking the annotated text or image.
Improved accessibility: Annotations allow your customers to access more promotional information without opening the entire email, saving time and effort. This can increase the likelihood of customers exploring and engaging with the promoted content.
Enhanced promotional value: Annotations provide a platform to highlight key aspects of the promotions, such as deals and expiration dates. This makes it easier for your customers to get essential details, increasing their interest in the offer.
Convenient mobile experience: Annotations target recipients who use Gmail on their mobile devices. They enhance the mobile experience, taking advantage of the increasing smartphone dependence on email browsing.
Prerequisite
SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentications must be configured for the sending domain as follows:
If you use MoEngage as your email sender, the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication configurations are completed as part of onboarding.
If you use your own email service provider, check if the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication configuration is set up correctly.
The sender domain (not email ID) must be allowed to be listed with Google. For this, an email must be sent to p-gmail-outreach@google.com.
The Product Carousel is subject to a Density Cap limitation, which requires it to be deployed to a bulk audience for proper rendering. While there is no explicit definition of bulk, an audience size exceeding 100 individuals is considered a fair estimation.

It should be noted that sending a marked-up email to oneself for testing purposes won’t result in annotations appearing in the inbox. However, marketers can preview the annotations in the MoEngage dashboard. Google also offers a tool for this purpose.
The algorithm is believed to render annotations where the content
abides by the ad policies of Google
uses high-quality imagery with correct aspect ratios
not personalized
comes from brands with a history of engagement.
High-quality images with specified aspect ratios must be used while creating Deal Annotations and Product Carousel. The aspect ratios are mentioned here. 
Configure Gmail Annotations in MoEngage

Perform the following steps to configure Gmail annotations while creating an email campaign:

Navigate to Step 2: Create Content in email campaigns.
Select the templates from any of the following options:
Drag and drop editor
Custom HTML editor
My saved templates
After selecting the template, navigate to the Email details section.
In the Gmail annotation tab, click Add Gmail annotation.

A deal annotation displays text-based details about a promotion, such as a promotion code or expiration date. Perform the following steps to create a deal card:

After adding the sender logo, turn the Deal annotations toggle on and enter the following details:

Field	Description
Description	Type a description for the deal card. This text is displayed as a deal badge. Make sure that you do not use more than four words or full sentence in this box, this may truncates the added description.
For example, 40% off or Sale is here. For best practices regarding deal badge, refer here.
Offer code	Type the discount or promotion code for the offer. Make sure that you the limit the characters added for optimal rendering.
For example, DEAL60. For best practices regarding discount code, refer here.
Start date	Select your offer's start date and time.
End date	Select your offer's end date and time. Ensure that your offer's end date is aligned with the campaign start date. If this condition is not satisfied, the Google annotation may not be displayed in the recipient inbox.

Headline	Type a short description of the promotion displayed under the preview image. Note that all the products added must have a headline. If you miss adding a headline for one product, it fails to display headlines for all products.
Original Price	Type the original price of the products to be displayed on the carousel. Note that all the products added must have an original price. If you miss adding the original price for one product, this fails to display headlines for all products.
Discount type	

Select the type of discount. The following options are available:

Discounted Price: This option considers the amount added in the Discount value field as the price amount and subtracts this amount from the original price. For example, if the Original Price is 700, the Discount type is Discounted Price, and the Discount value is 50, then 50 from the original price will be reduced.
Discounted Percentage: This option considers the amount added in the Discount value field in percentage and subtracts this percentage from the original price. For example, if the Original Price is 700, the Discount type is Discounted Percentage, and the Discount value is 50, then 50% of the original price will be reduced.

In both cases, the email recipient views the Original Price as struck off and the Discounted Price emboldened, as shown in the following image:


Discount value	Type the discount value for your products in the carousel.


You can preview the contents of your product carousel under the Preview section. Note that all the above fields of the Product Carousel can be personalized. To know more about personalization, refer to Personalize Email Content.
Click Delete Gmail annotation to delete the created product carousel.

Using BIMI 

BIMI is a verification framework that authenticates the brand and enables the display of the brand logo in the avatar field of emails. Yahoo! Mail and Google have adopted the BIMI method. For more information on implementing BIMI, refer to Why, What, and How BIMI and How BIMI differs from other authentication methods.

 

Ensure the following:

Ensure that DMARC authentication is based on organizational policy. Set it to either quarantine or reject.
Publish the BIMI record to your DNS, which has the logo indicator in SVG format or a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC).
You can contact the MoEngage Support team.

Using your email account 

To use your email account for adding a sender image, the following prerequisites need to be met:

Ensure that your sending address has a mailbox or emailing account.
Ensure that you can easily add a sender image in the mailbox or emailing account. 

Navigate to Settings and use the option to upload or change your sender image. For more information about adding sender images for Outlook and Google, refer to Outlook and Google.

Using Custom Fonts in Email

MoEngage Email campaign and channel supports any custom fonts, including web-safe fonts. You can contact MoEngage support to enable this. The MoEngage HTML WYSIWYG Editor and the Drag and Drop WYSIWYG Editor supports the following fonts:

Arial
Courier

info	

Font Support for Gmail and Outlook

Gmail only supports any custom fonts.
Outlook does not support custom or web fonts but only traditional web-safe fonts.
Using Gmail Markups

Markups help users interact with an email in Gmail without opening it by adding call-to-action buttons or links in the subject line. Gmail uses schema.org, a markup vocabulary, an open standard that can be used to add code (markup) to your email templates. With markups, you can highlight important information and improve conversions (click-through rates). For example, you can use Gmail markup to bring up cards in the inbox that highlight the travel information of the user (such as departure time, date, flight information, and so on). Similarly, you can add order confirmation, shipping/delivery information, and reservation details and highlight them or help users take action by adding actions to the email.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

 

Your domain should be registered with Google for the markups to work. For more information, refer to Registering with Google.

Add Markups to Email Template

To add a markup to your email template, do the following:

Choose the desired markup from the type that you want to add and navigate to it from here. For example, to add a one-click action to the email template, navigate to the one-click action reference page.
Copy the Micro Data (not the JSON-LD) for the desired action and paste it to your Email Template in MoEngage during campaign creation.

Example

 

To show the flight details on a card in the flight reservation confirmation email, do the following:

Copy the micro data from Flight Reservation. 


Add this to the body of your Email Template (either past the code inside the custom HTML template's Body or add an HTML block in the drag and drop editor and paste this code inside it) and publish the campaign.

Personalize Email Content
Overview

Personalized emails have higher open rates and conversions because they leverage the email context and are relevant. This article describes how you can personalize your email campaigns based on:

User attributes: Name, Location, or other attributes (for both general and event-triggered emails).
Event attributes: Product Image, Product Price, Product Name, and so on of an event- Added to Cart (only for event-triggered emails).
Business Event attributes: Product ID, Item Code, Product Image, Price, Series Name, Genre of the Series, Case, and so on.
Campaign attributes: Campaign Name, Campaign id, and Campaign Tags.

Before starting with personalization, ensure you have configured Email Settings and read about how to create email campaigns.

Personalization is supported in:

Email Subject 
Email Content
Sender Name
From email address
Reply-to email address

Along with Email Text personalization, MoEngage also supports the following:

Personalized Images for Cart Abandonment, Search Drop-offs, and so on
Personalized URLs to increase conversions by redirecting the user to the right link
Insert Personalization

To insert personalization in the Email Subject/Content Text, enter ""@"" and select the user/event attribute.

On selecting the attribute, you will be prompted to select the Fallback mechanism for this user attribute.

warning	

Warning

When Fallback Mechanism is unavailable through the MoEngage UI, you can define  the fallback using Jinja.

Example:

Dear {{UserAttribute['u_fn']|default('MOE_NOT_SEND')}} OR Dear {{UserAttribute['u_fn']|default('Guest')}}

default('MOE_NOT_SEND') will suppress the message from going out.
default('Guest') will use 'Guest' when the value for the personalization attribute is unavailable.
Fallback Mechanism

The fallback mechanism is useful when personalization fails due to the attribute not being present for the user or the non-resolution of the specific user attribute.


You can select one of the following fallback options:

No Fallback text: The user attribute will be removed if not present/resolved for that user.
Note: The No fallback option is not available for the Sender Name field.
Enter the Fallback text: The user attribute will be replaced with the text you have entered.
Do not send this email if personalization fails: The email will not be sent to the user if the personalized user attribute is not present/resolved for that user.
info	

Note

Campaign attributes cannot be edited in personalized previews.
During campaign creation, if the campaign ID is added for personalization, a dummy value is used in its place in the personalized preview, as the campaign ID gets generated only after the campaign is created.
Ensure that custom attributes do not have the same names as standard attributes of MoEngage. If a custom attribute and a standard attribute having the same name are used for personalization, it can result in incorrect personalization.

Content can also be personalized using Content APIs, Content Blocks, and Auxiliary Data.

Personalization for Business Event-Triggered Campaigns

In business event-triggered Email campaigns, you can use the attribute of the business event that is mapped to the campaign to personalize the campaign.

To personalize the campaign:

Type '@' in the content creation step to invoke the personalization editor.
The attributes of the Business Event mapped to the campaign are shown under the Business Event Attribute, as shown below:

Choose the attribute to be used for personalization and customize the message.

Personalization with business events can be a huge differentiator in terms of effort and automation, as you can use one template and send multiple campaigns with it. For example, if you have to communicate information about three new web series that are being launched, you can do so with the same campaign. You can use the event attributes to personalize the message for each series by using the series name, image, cast, and air date to send the communication to your dynamic segment (that matches the user interest (say, preferred genre) to that of the genre of the series).

Personalization Content Using Content Blocks

Content Blocks are reusable content that can be used across various campaigns. These are particularly useful for headers, footers, signature blocks, terms and conditions, and so on for email campaigns.

Add a Content Block

To add a content block:

Type @ in the message section and navigate to the Content blocks tab that pops up on the personalization screen.

Both HTML and Text type content blocks can be added when personalizing content for email campaigns.
Click Done to insert the chosen content block. View the added content block in the preview section.
Preview an Email Message That Contains a Content Block

The content block shown above appears as follows in the preview mode:

Personalize Content Using Auxiliary Data

You can personalize your Email content using auxiliary data by selecting the auxiliary data attributes in the personalization editor.

To personalize content using Auxiliary Data attributes:

Enter @ in the fields such as template, sender name, subject (wherever personalization is supported) to invoke the personalization editor.
Select the Aux Data tab.
In the Aux data drop-down list, select the Auxiliary Data file whose attribute you wish to use for personalization.
In the Lookup value drop-down list, select the primary key specified for the Auxiliary Data during import. This will identify the user for whom the auxiliary data is being fetched.
In the Attribute drop-down list, specify the attribute to be personalized using the auxiliary data.
Click Done. The auxiliary data Jinja will get added to the field or the editor.

For more information, refer to Personalize Campaign Content Using Auxiliary Data.

Personalize Images

Image personalization helps you insert contextual images in emails, which are mainly useful for cart abandonment emails.

Personalize Images Using the Drag and Drop Editor
Select the ""Cart Abandonment"" template in the ""Content"" section or use your own email template.

Drag and drop the 'Dynamic Content' icon from the content tab into the template.
Click the Dynamic Content inside the template. The Add button in the content tab that lets you personalize the image.

Click Add and the following screen is displayed.

Enter the image URL and personalize using ""@"". If you are tracking the entire image URL as an attribute, you can directly refer to that attribute using ""@"".
Select the fallback mechanism. This is applicable if the attribute is not correctly resolved or there is no image present at the URL after resolving the attribute. You can either enter a fallback image (this will be shown if personalization fails) or decide not to send the email if the image is not personalized.
Click Add to get the personalized image added to the template.
Personalization Images Using the Custom HTML Editor
Click the Custom HTML Editor in Step 2 of the campaign creation and choose the Edit/Paste HTML Template option. The following screen is displayed.

Click Image personalization on the top pane. The following screen is displayed.

Enter the image URL and personalize using ""@"". If you are tracking the entire image URL as an attribute, you can directly refer to that attribute using ""@"".
You can select a fallback mechanism. This is applicable if the attribute is not correctly resolved or there is no image present at the URL after resolving the attribute. You can enter a fallback image (this will be shown if personalization fails) or decide not to send the email if the image is not personalized.

Click Copy And Close to copy and insert this image URL. This will copy the image URL to the clipboard and close the Personalization window. A URL Copied pops up at the bottom right corner near the custom HTML editor.
Cick  the   icon in the custom HTML editor to insert the personalized image.

You can replace the existing image or insert a new image in the template.
Replace an Existing Image in the Template 
Select the image and click Replace.

Enter the personalized URL under the Image personalization tab and click Replace.

Insert a New Image in the Template
Click Insert Image in the top bar of the editor.

Enter the personalized URL under the Image personalization tab and click Insert.

After this personalized image is inserted/replaced, you can change the image size by extending/reducing the borders or by specifying a size in the Resize option on selecting the image. Make sure the image size matches the actual and fallback images. Otherwise, the resolution might result in image distortion.

Personalize URLs

You can also personalize the URLs or deep links where you redirect the user upon a click by the user. 

Click Link personalization as shown below:



Create a personalised URL in the text box that appears. Enter @ in the text box provided. 
In the following Email Personalization dialog box that appears, choose the attribute and click Done.

You can then copy this link and paste it wherever required, into the HTML code.

Personalize Email Content with Content APIs

Content APIs allow you to create personalized campaigns by fetching data dynamically at the time of sending the campaign based on Recommendations or coupons or other Personalization APIs. Such targeted, relevant, and timely communication has been proven to have much better engagement and conversion rates than generic email campaigns. For more information about Content APIs, click here.

Using Content APIs in MoEngage

Follow these three steps to use Content API in MoEngage.

Add an API to MoEngage.

Create a personalized email campaign using the saved Content API.

Personalize different elements in the email using Content API such as Images, Links, Dynamic text, and so on. You can employ Content API in both Subject Line and the email body.

Send the campaign.

Add an API to MoEngage

To set up an API to be used during MoEngage campaigns, add the URL and parameters of the Content API to the MoEngage platform. Follow these steps:

Navigate to MoEngage Dashboard > Settings > APIs and click the Content API tab.

Click Add button.
The following Add Content API screen is displayed.


 

Fill in the following details:

 
Field	Description
API Name	Type the Content API name
API Type	Select the type as Single.
API URL	Type the complete URL of the Content API.
Header	Click the plus sign and type the key value for the headers used in the Content API
Key Value Parameters	Click the plus sign to add key value for the parameters used in the Content API. Use “@” in the value field to choose from the list of pre-defined user attributes. The parameters cannot be personalized using Event attributes in the value field.

4. Click Save.

The Content API is saved in the MoEngage app.

Create a personalized email campaign

Create a campaign using the steps described in Create Email Campaign. During the campaign creation, in the content creation step use the ContentApi variable to access all the configured Content API sources.  You can use the Content API by directly calling the ContentApi variable in the code or by choosing the Content API from the Email Personalization UI.

You can add the created Content APIs using the Personalization screen as shown below. Type '@' in the Custom HTML Editor and add the Content API created.

Click on 'Done' and the Content API gets added to the email message.

For example, in the screenshot shown below, the Content API is used to dynamically fetch the Recommened Products for a given user id. Marketers can use this feature to engage users with product recommendations and nudge them towards making a purchase. The value parameter can be a dynamic parameter (type '@' to add a user attribute to be passed to the Content API) or can be a static parameter that can be keyed in the value section.

This when added, appears as follows in the Custom HTML Editor.

Click on the Preview option to see how the user will see it in their inbox.

Examples
Example 1

You may have a “cart” data source with the following JSON:

JSON
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{

	 ""date"": ""March 10, 2016"",

	 ""items"": [

	   {

	     ""name"": ""belt"",

	     ""image"": ""http://mydomain.com/images/1001.jpg"",

	     ""price"": 11

	   }, {

	     ""name"": ""shoes"",

	     ""image"": ""http://mydomain.com/images/1002.jpg"",

	     ""price"": 12

	   }, {

	     ""name"": ""hat"",

	     ""image"": ""http://mydomain.com/images/1003.jpg"",

	     ""price"": 10

	   }

	 ]

	}

In the content creation, use the following code:

Code
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% for cart_item in ContentApi.cart().items %}

	 <div>

	   <h2>{{ cart_item.name }}: ${{ cart_item.price|round(2) }}</h2>

	   <img src=""{{ cart_item.image }}"" />

	 </div>

	{% endfor %}
Example 2

The campaigns contain placeholders for different SKUs (in this case, hotels), along with the required formatting, segmentation, and triggering schedules.

Send the Email Campaign

At the time of sending the message, for the example above the system would:

Invoke the Content API to fetch hotels recommended for the user based on the search parameters like destination, check-in, and check-out dates, number of adults and children, and so on.

Populate the email with details of the recommended hotels like the name, rating, price, image, and ranking in an HTML-formatted, personalized email.

Do this for every user belonging to the specified segment dynamically without any manual input.

Each of these preview thumbnails can be clicked and viewed on a full scale.

You can also reload the preview images in case of issues. Note: Reloading a test will not decrease your monthly tests. 
You can also rate your tests with a thumbs up/down. This allows you to collaborate better with your teammates.
You can also export your tests by clicking on the export button. Enter a file name and select file type (pdf/zip) to export your results. The file will provide you with detailed images with respect to every device and client. The export will be sent to the logged-in user of the dashboard. 
Spam Checker 

Click on ""Spam checker"" in the sidebar to see the spam score of your content. The spam checker predicts the likelihood of your campaign hitting the spam folder instead of the inbox. The test looks at the content of your email that may cause spam delivery, such as:

Blacklisted URLs in the email or its content.
Misleading subject lines. Very image-heavy email content.
Spelling and grammar issues.
Missing unsubscribe link in the footer.
Spam trigger words, subject line (too long or too short), or a sender email address that has been blacklisted

Campaign Analytics

The analytics section contains information about the performance stats and revenue metrics.

Global Analytics Filters

These filters are applied to all the sections in the Analytics tab.

Date Range- Select the date range for which you want to view the performance stats.
Attribution Type- Select the attribution type (Click through, In-session, and View through) to view the analytics information for the specified attribution type. The default attribution type is View through attribution. Refer to the paragraph below for information on attribution types. For more information, refer to the paragraph below.

Attribution Types - You can track your conversion via three methods: View through, click-through, and in-session attribution. With conversion tracking, marketers can see which campaigns have led to achieving business goals (conversion goals for the campaign). If a customer clicked on your email and converted, it would be termed a click-through conversion, and if a customer opened your email and converted afterward, it would be termed a view-through conversion. In-session conversions are those conversions that were made within 30 minutes after the notification click.

For example, consider the case where three customers, namely Users A, B, and C, received your email from campaign C1.

User A clicked on the message and did the conversion event within 30 minutes (we assume it to be the same session) of clicking.
User B clicked on the message and did the conversion event 2-3 hours after clicking.
User C saw your message, later launched the app directly, and made the conversion.

When you attribute this conversion to campaign C1, User A is direct attribution, while User B and C are indirect attributions.

Attribution Type	Description	Example
View through	

The view through attribution is an Impression based tracking and is displayed by default when campaign analytics is loaded. View-through attribution is the total number of conversion goals executed by users who received your communication within the configured attribution window from the time of receiving the campaign. This appears as a default filter in your Campaign Performance.

	If the user received your email at 7 AM and your Attribution window was 12 hours, the user conversion events till 7 PM will be attributed to this campaign using View-Through Attribution.
Click through	

Click-through attribution is click-based tracking. Click-through attribution is the number of conversion goals executed by users who clicked the notification within the configured attribution window from the time of click.

	If the user receives your email at 7 AM, clicks it at 8 AM, and your Attribution window is 12 hours, the user conversion events till 8 PM are attributed to this campaign in Click-Through Attribution.
In-session	

The in-session attribution is based on In-session tracking. The in-session attribution is the number of conversion goals executed by users within 30 minutes after clicking your communication.

	

If the user receives your email at 7 AM, clicks it at 8 AM, and your Attribution window is 12 hours, the user conversion events till 8:30 AM (within 30 minutes of starting the session) will be attributed to this campaign in In-Session Attribution.

 

Attribution Window - Attribution Window is the duration calculated from the time a user receives or clicks the campaign having specific conversion goals. For example, two campaigns with a conversion goal as a purchase are created. Campaign C1 at time H hours and campaign C2 at H+12 hours. The customer achieves the conversion goal for purchase with the campaigns C1 and C2 at time H+15 hours. The conversion of customers is attributed both to C1 and C2.

In MoEngage campaigns, the maximum attribution window is 36 hours. When you send more than one campaign with a difference of less than 36 hours, then set the attribution window:

Lesser than 36 hours
With the duration difference in sending the campaigns.

For example, if you are sending campaigns at the difference of 12 hours, then set the attribution window as 12 hours.

Campaign Performance Stats

Campaign performance provides the impact of your email campaigns.

Actions that can be performed in the stats section

Choose the number view or the percentage view to see the stats as numbers or percentage values.
View the unique or total occurrences of stats by selecting Unique or Total in the dropdown at the top of the section.
Pin metrics - you can pin the metrics you want to see using the Pin metrics dropdown at the top right corner. You can pin up to five metrics. The selected metric pins are available in the Pinned Metrics section. Click Show all metrics to see all the metrics being tracked for the campaign and Hide unpinned metrics to see only the pinned metrics for the campaign.

The following campaign performance stats are available:

Conversion Metrics - These metrics pertain to the conversion goals set for the campaign. The higher these metrics, the more effective your campaign! The conversion metrics tracked for your email campaigns are shown in the table below.
Metric	Description
Converted Users	

This metric shows the number of unique users who have completed the primary conversion. Converted Users were previously called Conversions. This metric displays the number of times users converted from each campaign. For campaigns having only one recurrence, conversion represents unique users who have accomplished the primary conversion goal event at least once within the attribution window. For active campaigns, conversions represent the number of unique users converted per instance of an active campaign. Higher conversions indicate higher effectiveness of your campaign in driving the business goals. 

 

Example

If a user receives one Campaign Instance on Day X and another on Day Y and converts once on both days, the conversions are counted as two (instead of being counted as one in the previous version.)
If a user receives one campaign instance on Day X and converts twice from the same campaign, conversions will be counted as 1.
If a user receives two campaign instances of the same campaign on Day X and converts for both of them, conversions will be counted as 2. 

Event (Primary)	

This metric shows the total number of primary conversion goal events within the attribution window (configurable) from the time user received the notification.

 

You can also view the uplift percentage in the event primary card. For more information, refer to Uplift in Campaigns.

 

Event (Primary) - The conversions for active campaigns are several conversion events from all campaign notifications. The metric is the cumulative primary conversion events after the start of the first campaign.

 

Example

 

Suppose a user receives an email for a purchased campaign. If the user made two purchases, then the conversion events are two.


Conversion Rate(CVR)	

This metric shows the percentage ratio of users who have performed the conversion event. The conversion count is tracked as Unique. Higher conversion events indicate higher effectiveness of your campaign in driving the business goals.

 

CVR for the various attribution types is listed below:

View through attribution CVR = ((Unique conversions) / (Total impressions)) * 100
Click through attribution CVR = ((Unique conversions) / (Total clicks)) * 100
In-session attribution CVR = ((Unique conversions) / (Total clicks)) * 100

Revenue Metrics	

There are three revenue metrics for your campaign if they are enabled for the primary goal.

Total Campaign Revenue is the sum of the total order value across conversion events attributed to the campaign.
Average Order value = (Total Revenue/ Number of conversion events)
Average Revenue per user = (Total Revenue/ Number of unique conversions)

These revenue metrics are tracked for all attribution types- View through, Click Through, and In-session attribution.

Delivery Metrics - The delivery metrics tracked for your email campaigns are described in the table below.
Metric	Description
Attempted	This metric shows the number of users who qualified for the campaign and for whom MoEngage tried sending the message.
Sent	

This metric represents the total number of emails sent to the users. The number does not reflect the following:

Duplicate or invalid emails
Bounces or unsubscribed or complained users
Emails with email Frequency Capping and Personalization failures.

Sent rate is calculated as (Sent/Attempted)*100.


Delivered	

The total number of emails delivered to the users. This information is provided by email delivery partners like SendGrid.

 

The delivery rate is the percentage ratio of users to whom the emails were sent and delivered.

 

Delivery rate = ((Total delivered emails) / (Total emails sent)) * 100.

 

Note: The delivery rate applies to email campaigns sent using Sendgrid.


Failed To Send	

This metric represents the Failed rate and shows the percentage of campaigns that failed out of the campaigns that were attempted to be sent by MoEngage.

 

Failed rate is calculated as (Failed To Send/Attempted)*100.


Bounced	

The total number of emails that bounced due to incorrect email addresses and rejections from the mail server.

 

Bounce indicates both hard bounce and soft bounce of emails.

 

Bounce rate is the percentage of users who had the bounce of emails.

 

Bounce rate = ((Total hard bounces) + (Total soft bounces)) / (Total Sent emails)) * 100

 

Hard Bounce

 

The total number of email addresses that were rejected by the mail server due to:

Incorrect email address
Invalid email address
Email address does not exist
The email addresses are quarantined and do not receive emails from MoEngage.

Soft Bounce

 

The total number of email addresses to which the email was not successfully delivered due to temporary issues such as the mailbox being full, the mail server is not active, and so on.

 

The email addresses are not quarantined and will receive the emails next time.

Engagement Metrics - The engagement metrics tracked for your email campaigns are described in the table below.
Metric	Description
Opened	

The total number of times users have opened the email. MoEngage tracks a user open by adding a unique 1px invisible image in the email template. An open is recorded when this image gets downloaded when the email is opened by the user.

You can calculate Open Rates using the open metric, which is calculated as follows:

 

OPEN RATE (Unique)

 

The percentage of opens received from the delivered emails.

 

Open rate (Unique) = ((Total unique opens) / (Total delivered emails)) * 100.

 


Email Opens are also prone to inflation due to bot activity. MoEngage has introduced the Adjusted opens metric to help you understand the impact of the machine opens in your analytics and measure authentic user opens.

 

 

 

Adjusted open metric is calculated as follows:

 

ADJUSTED OPEN RATE

 

The percentage of authentic users who have opened the delivered emails.

 

Adjusted open rate = ((Total unique authentic user opens) / (Total delivered emails)) * 100.

 

Note:

This metric is visible only when the High sensitivity (recommended) option under Bot interaction sensitivity in General settings is enabled. To view the adjusted metrics in your engagement analytics, configure the Bot interaction sensitivity section in General Settings as mentioned here.
The uniqueness of opens is maintained for 10 days. So if a user U1 opens the email on D1 and D11, the unique opens will still be 2 because these opens were more than 10 days apart.

Clicked	

Clicks represent the total number of clicks on any link in the email by the users after the email delivery.


Click to Open Rate (Unique)	

This metric is the percentage of unique clicks to opened emails.

 

Click to open rate = ((Unique clicks) / (Unique opens)) * 100


Adjusted Click to Open Rate	

This metric is the ratio of unique user clicks to unique authentic email opens.

 

Adjusted Click to Open Rate = ((Unique clicks) / (Unique authentic user opens)) * 100

 

Note: This metric is visible only when the High sensitivity (recommended) option under Bot interaction sensitivity in General settings is enabled.

 

To view the adjusted metrics in your engagement analytics, configure the Bot interaction sensitivity section in General Settings as mentioned here.


Click through Rate (Total)	

The percentage ratio of total clicks for email messages delivered successfully.

 

Click through rate = ((Total clicks) / (Total number of emails delivered)) * 100

Retention Metrics - These metrics pertain to the number of users who have unsubscribed from receiving communications from your brand or have marked the email as spam. The retention metrics tracked for your email campaigns are described in the table below.
Metric	Description
Spam	

Spam represents the total number of users who marked the email as spam in their inbox.

 

Spam reports that you view in campaign analytics are excluded from Gmail ISP. Gmail provides visibility into spam rate and reputation metrics in the Google Postmaster tool.

 

Complaint rate is the percentage of users who reported the email as SPAM.

 

Complaint rate = ((Total complaints) / (Total Delivered emails)) * 100


Unsubscribed	

This metric represents the total number of users who have clicked the unsubscribe link and unsubscribed after receiving the email sent from the campaign.

 

When a user unsubscribes from receiving all communications from your brand, promotional emails are not sent to them.

 

Unsubscribed rate is the percentage of users who clicked the unsubscribe link.

 

Unsubscribed rate = ((Total unsubscribes) / (Total Delivered emails)) * 100

 

Note: The Unsubscribed metric includes users who have unsubscribed at Sendgrid as well. For example, if a user is marked as having unsubscribed in Sendgrid and the same information is not available with MoEngage, MoEngage will send the email to Sendgrid, and Sendgrid will not send the same to the user. This then would be counted towards the Unsubscribed metric in MoEngage.

Locale/Variation Performance 

You can see the breakdown of performance metrics (Opens, Adjusted Opens, Clicks, Conversions, Conversion goals, and so on) for each variation in the default locale. This helps you assess and compare the effectiveness of the variations.

You can view the uplift percentage on the tabular view of Locale/Variation performance. For more information, refer to Uplift in Campaigns.

Conversion Goals Performance (uplift)

You will be able to see this section when you have set more than one conversion goal for your campaigns. The section compares the performance of goals set by the marketer for the campaign.

Total Conversions: Will show all goal events for the respective goals i.e., if a user made a purchase twice, it will be shown twice. It is the equivalent of conversion events covered in the sections above.

Unique Conversions: Goals are unique across the users converted per campaign instance. It is the equivalent of the Conversions metric covered in the sections above.

You can view the uplift percentage in the tabular view of Conversion Goals performance. For more information, refer to Uplift in Campaigns.


 

Campaign Delivery

The campaign delivery stats section helps you understand the delivery funnel and the number of users that were removed in each funnel stage.

The various delivery funnel stages are explained in the table below:

Funnel Stage	What it represents
Users with Email	Represents the total number of users in the segment who have an email attribute
After B/U/C removal	Represents the number of users after removing email addresses that have bounced earlier, unsubscribed, or reported spam complaints from the Users with Email count.
After Invalid/Duplicate removal	

Represents the number of users obtained after removing Invalid emails (missing ""@"" & ""."") and Duplicate Emails (multiple users with the same email address) from the After B/U/C removal count.


After FC Removal	Represents the number of users obtained after removing emails that have crossed Frequency Capping as defined in the FC Settings from the After Invalid/Duplicate removal count.
After Personalization Removal	Represents the number of users obtained after removing emails for which the email could not be sent due to personalization failure.
Sent	Represents the number the count of emails that have been sent.
Delivered	Represents the total number of emails delivered to the users. This information is provided by email delivery partners like SendGrid.
Error breakdown

This section describes the various campaign delivery failures and their reasons. Errors are categorized under the following heads:

Failed to Send errors - these errors happen when the email has not been sent, and they could happen due to one of these reasons:

users who have been removed as they were part of the campaign's control group
users who have been removed from the campaign because of earlier bounces, unsubscribes, and complaints
users who do not have a valid email address or in case of duplicates (many users having the same email address)
users for whom personalization attributes were not available and thus were dropped from the campaign
Failed to Deliver errors - these errors happen when the email was sent by MoEngage but could not be delivered to the user. This could happen due to any of the following reasons:
Error	Description	Resolution
SMTPException	This is a generic SMTP error and happens when the SMTP connection was interrupted or closed. 	You will have to check with the SMTP Provider or try again later.
SMTPDataError	This error means that the SMTP Provider has refused to accept the emails sent by MoEngage. 	You will have to check with the SMTP Provider to resolve this error.
SMTPSenderRefused	This error means that the sender's address was not accepted by the SMTP Provider.	You will have to check with the SMTP provider or try again later.
SMTPRecipientRefused	This error means that the recipient's address was not accepted by the SMTP Provider.	You will have to check with the SMTP provider or try again later.
InvalidSMTPHostDetails	This error means that the SMTP host details provided are invalid. 	You will have to check the email configuration settings on the MoEngage Dashboard.
SMTPAuthenticationError	This error means that the SMTP authentication details are invalid.	You will have to check the username and password added in the email configuration settings on the MoEngage Dashboard.
EncryptedConnectionFailed	This error means that the SMTP connection failed due to TLS/SSL protocol issues.	You will have to check with the SMTP provider or try again later.
Error in Attachments	These errors could be because the file size in an attachment was too large, the attachment URL was invalid, there is no file available on the added URL, and so on.	You will have to check the attachments added in Step 2 (Content) of email campaign creation.
CustomAPI	These errors happen when a connection cannot be established with the custom API endpoint configured for your account.	You will have to ensure that the API endpoint is correct and retry sending the campaign.
MaximumLimitExceeded	This error occurs if the credit limit of your account with the SMTP Provider has been exceeded. 	You will have to check with the SMTP Provider and update the credit limit before trying again.
Content API errors	These errors occur when the personalized attributes are not available for some users or when a connection could not be established with the Content API endpoint.	You will have to ensure that the API endpoint and the configuration information are correct and retry sending the campaign.
Email Unsubscribe Drop	

Consider that there is more than one user profile, for instance, A and B, with the same email ID. If User A has unsubscribed in the past, it will reflect in User profile A, but not in User profile B. 

 

Hence, if A and B are targeted in an Email Campaign, MoEngage will drop User A and will show an error saying Failure to Send as part of BUC check. 

 

However, MoEngage will try to send that campaign to User B. This will result in an ""Email Unsubscribe Drop"" error as Sendgrid will not attempt the email delivery for User B as it identifies profiles based on email IDs. 

	Avoiding multiple user profiles with the same Email ID.

Personalization Errors

You can see personalization errors in the Failed to send error category in the Error Breakdown Table. Click See breakdown in the Name column for Personalization errors to get a detailed view of the number of users for whom personalization has failed and their reasons.

Personalization errors can be classified into the following categories:

Error Category	Description


User Attribute

	This denotes the unavailability of the user attribute used in personalization either because it is not available in the system (for example, copy-paste errors) or it is not available for the specific user. For example, if the first_name user attribute is used in personalization and it is not available for a user, this will result in a User Attribute error.


Event Attribute

	This denotes the unavailability of the user attribute used in personalization either because it is not available in the system (for example, copy-paste errors) or it is not available for the specific user. For example, if the product_name event attribute is used in personalization and it is not available for a user, this will result in an Event Attribute error.


Campaign Attribute

	This denotes an unavailability of campaign-specific information used in personalization. For example, if campaign tags have been used for personalization and the campaign tag attribute is missing, this will result in a Campaign Attribute error.


Undefined

	

This denotes errors that happen when MoEngage is unable to fetch the value for the attribute used in personalization. For example, if the image attribute is unavailable for a specific product in a product set, this will result in an Undefined error.




Unknown

	This denotes any error that does not fall into any of the categories mentioned above.

Note: The number of failures listed in the Personalization Failed category under Failed to Send denotes the unique number of users for whom personalization has failed. In some cases, this might differ from the count shown in the Personalization failure analysis UI as multiple failures can happen for the same user, and they might be counted under each of the failure categories shown in the UI. For example, if a user were to have a user attribute and event attribute failure, they would be counted for the number of failures in both these sections in the analysis screen while they would be counted as one in the Personalization Failed section.

Content API Analysis

In the case of a response other than 2xx, you will see the error code or the response of your Content API in the Content API analysis section below the error breakdown table, as shown below.

info	

Note

If the Content API being used in the campaign does not provide a 2xx/successful response, campaigns might still be delivered if the empty response has been handled in your JINJA code added in Step 2 of Campaign Creation (the content/message creation step).

Click Analysis

Click analysis and tracking help you understand which Call-to-actions (CTAs) work and can help you hone your email marketing strategy. You can view the performance of each link in your email and understand what works well and what doesn't with Click Analysis.

Note:

MoEngage tracks any URLs inside <a> or <area> tags only. URLs inside any other tag will not be tracked by MoEngage.
""Mailto:"" URLs are not tracked by MoEngage.
Click Map

A click map shows the links available on your email using a preview. In this section, you can:

view a heat map that helps you understand which links have performed better than others. Every link is named with Link# (where # represents a number. The first link for example, would be called Link1).
hover over a link to view the link name, unique and total clicks.
click on the link in the heat map. This will highlight the details about the link in the click breakdown table.
see a click breakdown table that has the following information:

Domain Reputation in MoEngage
Overview

Domain reputation is the health of a domain as perceived by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and mailbox providers. If your domain has a good reputation, the ISPs send your emails to the recipient’s inbox assuming that your emails are relevant and valuable to them. If your domain has a bad reputation, the ISPs may send your emails to the recipient’s spam folder or block your emails.

In email marketing, there are various factors that determine a domain's reputation. For example, engagement and conversion rate, spam complaint rate, spam traps, unsubscribe rate, and bounce rate.

If you are getting started with sending emails from a new domain, it is crucial to build your domain's reputation. For more information on how to build your domain reputation, refer to Email Warm-Up.

Domain Reputation Information in MoEngage Dashboard

MoEngage displays the domain reputation information in the dashboard so that marketers can understand their domain's health and its impact on the performance of their email campaigns. The domain reputation is indicated as High, Medium, Low, or Bad. This feature helps marketers to co-relate campaign's performance with domain reputation. It is recommended to add a domain with high reputation because it is a key factor that impacts email deliverability.

info	

Information

It is assumed that clients have provided access to their domain reputation information in Google Postmaster. MoEngage fetches updated domain reputation data from Google Postmaster and displays it in the dashboard.

All Campaigns Page

On the All campaigns page, MoEngage shows the domain reputation for email campaigns only. The current reputation of a specific domain used for the email campaign is displayed below the name of each campaign. 

Filter Campaigns

You can filter email campaigns using their domain reputation.

Email Configuration Page

MoEngage shows the domain reputation for each verified domain when you add a new ""from email address"" in email settings. Go to Settings > Channels > Email. The EMAIL SETTINGS page is displayed. On the GENERAL SETTINGS tab, you can see domain reputation for verified domains in the Domain reputation (DR) column.

Knowing the current reputation of a specific domain while adding a ""from email address"" in email settings helps you decide whether you must employ that domain or not.

Domain Reputation Trend

You can also see the trend of your domain reputation. The reputation of a domain can change over a period of time. Click the trend icon to see the trend of your domain reputation.

info	

Information

You need to have access to email settings to view this.

The Domain reputation pop-up with the trend of your domain reputation is displayed. By default, you can see the trend for the last 14 days.

You can select other periods from the drop-down list to see the domain reputation information in the past. Other supported periods are: Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Last 60 days, Last 90 days, and Last 120 days.

You can hover your mouse on the timeline to see the reputation of your domain on a specific date.

Email Creation Page

MoEngage shows the domain reputation for each unique domain when you select a ""from email address"" during email campaign creation.

When you hover your mouse on a specific domain, you can see more information such as when the reputation information was last updated. For example:

When you select a domain with a Medium/Low/Bad reputation, you will see a disclaimer. For example, in the following scenario, the marketer has selected a domain with a Low reputation:

Email Campaign Analytics Page

On the Campaign analytics and info page, MoEngage shows a disclaimer when the reputation of the domain used for that campaign is Medium/Low/Bad on the day when the campaign is published."

Domain Reputation Issues and Preventive Measures
Overview

Domain reputation refers to mailbox providers' (MBPs) perception of a domain's health. When a domain maintains a high reputation, MBPs usually deliver emails to recipients' inboxes, assuming they are relevant and valuable. Conversely, if a domain has a low or bad reputation, ISPs may redirect emails to recipients' spam folders or even block them altogether.
A variety of factors influence the domain's reputation. These include aspects such as engagement and conversion rate, spam complaints rate, spam traps rate, unsubscribe rate, and bounce rate.

info	

Information

The domain reputation data obtained from the Google Postmaster tool is exclusive to Gmail. It can't be applied to other mailbox providers with distinct metrics for monitoring sender health. For instance, Microsoft uses SNDS.

Adhering to the email best practices, such as setting up authentication, managing opt-in/consent, and sending personalized content, is an effective way to build a positive reputation. This can directly increase the return on investment (ROI) of your email marketing program. However, diverging from these guidelines can lead to negative consequences. The following section discusses the effects of not maintaining a stable domain reputation at high or medium.

Impact of Low or Bad Domain Reputation
Low Reputation

This indicates that Gmail has identified this sender as frequently sending a significant amount of spam. Emails from domains or IPs with low reputations typically land in the spam folder.

Bad Reputation

This indicates that Gmail has identified that this sender consistently sends a high amount of spam. Emails from domains or IPs with a bad reputation will always land in the spam folder or get rejected, which means they are soft bounced.

Impact

If your domain reputation is low or bad, your emails fail to reach the inboxes of Gmail recipients. Consequently, these emails will not achieve the intended objectives of your email campaigns, resulting in ineffective email communication with no conversions.

Thus, preventing your reputation from becoming low or bad is crucial. If it does occur, immediately halt, address all the issues, comply with industry best practices, and then gradually resume and increase the volume of your operations.

Reasons for the Drop in Domain Reputation

The email-sending behaviors mentioned below often lead to a bad or low reputation- either a gradual decline or an abrupt drop.

Ineffectual warm-up.

Reputation for all new senders must be built through warm-up and ramp-up over time.
Targeting unengaged users from a new domain.

Gmail, similar to all other mailbox providers, applies rate limitations to emails from a new sender and doesn't accommodate high volumes from a new domain or IP.
Warm-up is required to establish a positive reputation and gradually raise volume thresholds and acceptance rates.
This warm-up is accomplished by sending highly relevant content to a small group of highly engaged users at a slow rate (low RPM) and gradually increasing the volume.
Sending in fixed patterns without accounting for delivery, engagement metrics, and spam complaints.
If you ignore the signals from recipients, Gmail will put your emails in spam to protect those users.
Creating sudden spikes in volume instead of steadily increasing it. The sudden volume surges almost always cause a reputation drop.
A sudden volume spike always raises questions.
You would not be ramped up to send higher numbers.
Find the 
Secondly, from where did such a high number of email users suddenly come from?
Did they consent to receiving emails?

When was the last email sent to these users?
Is the prior consent still effective?
A gap in sending patterns followed by a surge in email volume or irregular high-volume campaigns.

IPs and domains tend to cool off after two weeks of inactivity.
They will slowly lose their reputation and ramped-up state.
An inactivity must be followed by a smaller send to the most engaged users and a gradual volume increase.
Moreover, after a longer period of inactivity (say 6 months or more), you need to reaffirm the content and manage expectations.
Not suppressing inactive users.
Take into account the signals from end recipients.
If users are not interacting with your emails, your sending behavior (frequency, segmentation, content relevancy) needs to be adjusted accordingly. You mustn’t continue to send emails to them in the same pattern. Use dynamic segments to manage this.
After a long period, if users continue to remain inactive, then they should be permanently suppressed.
Sending emails to purchased lists or users who did not explicitly sign up to receive emails.
This violates the basic rules of list management and data privacy.
Fix Domain Reputation Issues

As a marketer, you must adhere to the following guidelines to enhance the visibility of your email campaigns, particularly if your domain reputation isn't high.

When Domain Reputation Drops to Medium 

This indicates you can still improve the domain reputation.

Pause all one-time email campaigns from the affected domain for 3 days.
Use this time to figure out why the reputation droppedand charter your plan to fix it.
Continue sending event-triggered campaigns as before, unless there’s an issue with event-triggered campaigns.
Add a frequency capping (FC) of one email to a user in 1 day.
Make sure to send at least 1 campaign per week.
DO NOT target customers who have not engaged in the past 6 months.
Use RPM if 1k.
Create event-based triggered or life-cycle campaign use cases.
Use content personalization and reduce one-time campaigns.

When the domain reputation improves to High, revise the sending criteria for the unengaged cohorts as listed below:

For the cohorts of customers who have not engaged in the last 45 days:
Send targeted content.
Conduct surveys to analyze the lack of engagement.
Reduce the frequency of sending emails.
For the cohorts of customers who have not engaged in the last 9 months:
Suppress the customers permanently.
When Domain Reputation Drops to Low

This indicates your sending behavior is already suspicious.

Pause all one-time email campaigns from the affected domain for 10 days.
Use this time to figure out why the reputation dropped and charter your plan to fix it.
Continue sending event-triggered campaigns as before, unless there’s an issue with event-triggered campaigns.
Add a frequency capping (FC) of 1 email to a user in 3 days or less.
Send a maximum of two to three email campaigns weekly and at least one email per week to your most engaged users.
Note: Most engaged customers are customers: has executed email open at least 2 times in the last 30 days AND has executed app/site opened at least 2 times in the last 30 days
Do not target customers who have not engaged in the past 6 months.
Use RPM of 1000.

When the domain reputation improves to Medium, revise the sending criteria for the less engaged cohorts as listed below:

Expand the audience criteria to include other openers and app/site openers.
Increase the send frequency if required.
Create event-based triggered or life-cycle campaign use cases.
Use content personalization and reduce one-time campaigns.
When Domain Reputation Drops to Bad 

This indicates that Gmail has already flagged you as a bad sender and all your emails are likely going to spam if they are delivered at all.

Pause all email campaigns (one-time, event-triggered, flows, business events) from the affected domain for 20 days.
 Use this time to figure out why the reputation dropped and charter your plan to fix it.
Add a frequency capping (FC) of 1 email to a user in 7 days.
If there are any issues concerning your audience quality, or if reputation issues persist for over six months, send a confirmation email to reaffirm consent.
Send a maximum of two email campaigns weekly, and at least one email per week to your most engaged users.
Note: Most engaged customers are customers: has executed email open at least 5 times in the last 30 days AND has executed app/site opened at least 5 times in the last 30 days
Use RPM of 1000.
Do not target customers who have not engaged in the past 6 months.

When the domain reputation improves from bad to low, revise the sending criteria for the less engaged cohorts as listed below:

Expand the audience criteria to include other openers of the last 30 days.
Increase the send frequency to 2-3 campaigns per week if required.
Resume smart triggered campaigns.
Create event-based triggered or life-cycle campaign use cases.
Use content personalization and reduce one-time campaigns."

Optimize the Email Performance

This article helps you understand how to optimize email performance. For information on domain reputation issues and preventive measures, refer here.

Overview

The performance of your emails is evaluated based on email delivery and engagement metrics. This includes:

Delivery metrics assess factors such as the ratio of emails sent versus those delivered, instances of bounces, and deferrals. 
Engagement metrics, on the other hand, encompass a wider range of indicators, ranging from positive to negative outcomes.
Positive engagement metrics consist of metrics such as delivered, opened, clicked, and converted.
On the contrary, negative engagement metrics encompass complaints about spam and cases of unsubscribing from your emails.

To improve email performance, you must enhance your delivery and positive engagement while keeping your negative engagement low. To achieve this, you must perform the following:

Analyze your history
Find areas of improvement
Plan your campaigns
Analyze Your History

To enhance your email performance, it is essential to identify the specific areas that require improvement. For this, you must retrospectively assess the email performance data from the past 6 months and check for any recurring patterns. To analyze your email performance history, examine the following:

Trends in delivery and engagement metrics
Domain reputation data
Spam complaints rate
Active user base growth
Inbox placement reports

If you focus only on the most recent trends and overlook the overall trends, you might miss a gradual decline in email performance over several months. If you find any issues while analyzing the email performance history, you must debug, repair, and ramp up your email plan.

Find Areas of Improvement

After analyzing your email performance and addressing the issues identified during the analysis, it is crucial to identify potential areas for improvement. Consider the following areas where you can enhance email performance, with suggestions for each respective area:

Issues	Resolution
High hard bounces	
Secure user email collection points: This helps prevent incorrect or fake email addresses from being added to your email list.
Implement double opt-in: This adds additional verification to the email subscription process. Email addresses are added to the email list only after the user confirms the subscription. This guarantees the delivery of your emails to legitimate and active recipients.
Create an onboarding flow: By providing clear instructions, valuable content, and a positive user experience during the onboarding process, you can establish trust and increase the likelihood that subscribers will actively engage with your emails. This, in turn, helps reduce the chances of high hard bounces caused by disinterested or unengaged recipients. For more information on customer lifecycle campaigns, refer here.

High soft bounces	
Suppress repeated soft bounces: You must suppress soft bounces except in cases caused by IP/domain blocks or content filtering. This helps maintain a clean and engaged email list, prevent unnecessary retries, and ensure that your emails are delivered only to active and responsive recipients.
Use low request per minute (RPM): This allows your server or email service provider to manage resources effectively and maintain a reliable and efficient email delivery rate, leading to fewer bounces. For best practices regarding RPM, refer here.
Use the best time to send (BTS) for higher volumes: By sending emails at these times, you increase the chances of recipients opening, interacting with, and responding to your emails. This higher engagement leads to a lower risk of soft bounces because engaged recipients are more likely to have active and accessible email addresses.

High deferrals	
Adjust request per minute (RPM): This helps you balance sending emails at a reasonable rate and ensuring a smooth delivery process. It can result in fewer deferrals and increase your email campaigns' overall deliverability and success. For best practices regarding RPM, refer here.
Optimize the sending patterns: By sending emails consistently and in a controlled manner, you enhance the chances of successful delivery and improve the overall deliverability of your email campaigns. For best practices regarding sending patterns, refer here.
Ensure the warm-up is successful: This helps email providers recognize your IP address as a trusted sender, reducing the chances of deferrals. For more information on email warm-up, refer here.
Use the best time to send (BTS) for infrequent high-volume campaigns: This helps align your email delivery with your recipients' preferences and habits, improving your campaigns' overall effectiveness and success. It also reduces the likelihood of your emails being deferred due to low engagement or buried in recipients' crowded inboxes.

High unsubscribed	
Optimize segmentation strategy: This helps you achieve targeted and relevant email content, leading to increased engagement and a lower likelihood of unsubscribing. For best practices regarding segmentation strategy, refer here.
Increase frequency capping: This helps reduce campaign overexposure, improve relevance, enhance campaign effectiveness, and provide a better user experience, thereby reducing unsubscribing.
Ensure content is relevant to the segments: This helps in personalized messaging, meeting user expectations, addressing individual needs, avoiding spam or irrelevant content, and constantly refining content based on feedback and analysis.
Explore event-based triggered or life-cycle campaign use cases: This helps you deliver timely and personalized content to users based on their specific actions, behaviors, or campaign life-cycle stages. These strategies provide users with valuable and meaningful interactions, keeping them engaged and reducing the likelihood of unsubscribing.
Use content personalization and reduce one-time campaigns: This helps increase relevance, avoid information overload, enhance the customer experience, deliver segment-specific messaging, and provide personalized recommendations. These strategies create a more targeted and valuable interaction for subscribers, fostering engagement and reducing their likelihood of unsubscribing.

High spam complaints	
Ensure the unsubscribe link, both in the email body and list-unsubscribe, is working as expected
Ensure the unsubscribe requests are processed and reachability is updated as expected
If you send emails from multiple vendors, make sure all suppression users (unsubscribed and spam complaints) are in sync at all times between all systems.
Secure user email collection points. For this, implement double opt-in.
Creating onboarding flow and set the right expectations: This helps establish permission-based communication, be transparent about communication frequency, deliver value-oriented content, offer unsubscribe options, send welcome and confirmation emails, and proactively collect feedback. By following these practices, you can build trust, engage subscribers, and minimize the chances of their messages being marked as spam.
Optimize segmentation strategy: This helps enhance relevance, minimize message overload, eliminate content duplication, enable personalized communication, ensure optimal timing and frequency, and allow continuous testing and refinement. By delivering targeted and valuable content, you can engage subscribers, foster positive interactions, and reduce the chances of their messages being marked as spam. For best practices regarding segmentation strategy, refer here.
Increase frequency capping: This helps maintain a balanced approach to messaging. You can deliver valuable content while minimizing the risk of subscribers marking messages as spam.
Ensure content is relevant to the segments: This helps deliver targeted messaging, enable personalized communication, respect subscriber preferences, optimize message frequency, provide explicit permission and unsubscribe options, and encourage regular preference updates. By delivering valuable and relevant content, you can enhance the recipient's experience and minimize the risk of messages being marked as spam.
You can also configure subscription categories to allow users to choose what kind of emails they want to receive and at what frequency.
Explore event-based triggered or life-cycle campaign use cases: This helps create a more targeted and personalized approach to messaging. This, in turn, reduces the risk of recipients perceiving the communication as spam and ultimately leads to fewer spam complaints.
Use content personalization and reduce one-time campaigns: This helps maintain user engagement and build trusted relationships with valuable and relevant personalized content. It also decreases the likelihood of emails being marked as spam. 

Declining open trends	
Optimize segmentation strategy: This approach helps increase the likelihood of email opening by addressing their specific needs, utilizing personalized subject lines, and appropriately timing the emails. Regular testing and understanding audience preferences refine your approach, boosting open rates.
Increase frequency capping: This helps increase the willingness to open and engage with the emails received, send more personalized emails, and maintain the recipient's interest, thereby improving open rates.
Ensure the content is relevant to the segments: This helps you enhance personalization, increase relevance, boost engagement, build trust, and avoid sending irrelevant emails. Collectively, these factors contribute to higher email open rates.
You can also configure subscription categories to allow users to choose what kind of emails they want to receive and at what frequency.
Optimize the sunsetting policies: This helps maintain a more engaged and interested subscriber base, leading to higher open rates, improved deliverability, enhanced engagement metrics, better personalization, and cost optimization.
Analyze your onboarding flow: This allows you to refine your welcome emails, personalize content, optimize CTAs and email timing, conduct A/B testing, and address potential pain points. These efforts collectively improve the effectiveness of your onboarding process and increase email open rates.
Use AI to improve subject lines: This helps you create effective written content for email marketing campaigns, increasing the number of email opens. For more information on generating email subject lines and previewing text with Merlin AI, refer here.

Declining click trends	
Optimize segmentation strategy: This helps send relevant and personalized content, targeted offers, and behavioral triggers and keeps audiences engaged. These factors can significantly increase click rates by making your emails more compelling and aligned with each segment's interests and needs.
Ensure content is relevant to the segments.
Use content personalization and reduce one-time campaigns: This helps to increase the relevance of email content, improve engagement rates, utilize behavioral triggers, cultivate smaller engaged audiences, prevent email fatigue, and enable ongoing optimization. These efforts increase click rates by providing recipients with tailored, valuable, and timely content.

Infrequent campaigns	
Create weekly personalized periodic campaigns: This helps in consistent engagement, tailored content, responsive design, A/B testing, promotion highlights, and long-term relationship building. These factors collectively contribute to higher click rates by regularly delivering timely, relevant, and valuable content to subscribers. To maintain the reputation while sending only monthly campaigns, refer here.

 

Plan Your Campaigns

Given that deliverability or performance issues cannot be promptly resolved, it is crucial to plan email campaigns. Outline your strategies for effectively targeting each optimization option.

Review and monitor all metrics closely by running the email performance checklist.
Revise and adjust plans as you learn.
Repeat this in each quarter."

info	

Information

All of these must be done for each different sub-domain.

 

Criteria	Factors to be monitored
Compliance	
Are all the compliance requirements met?
If not - Pause everything and fix this first.

Email set up	
Is the email setup still intact?
If not - pause everything from the domain/IP set that has issues and fix that before resuming.

Sent volume	
Is the volume in line with the ramp-up plan (if applicable)?
If not, pause -> backtrack -> make sure all metrics are intact -> then resume.
Was there a volume spike?
Volume spike would be sent volume more than 150% of the highest volume sent in the last 30 days.
If yes, why did that happen? What has been done to ensure, it doesn't recur?
Send only to email openers with reduced frequency and reach out to each postmaster explaining the cause of the issue and steps taken to recover/prevent it from happening again.

Sending frequency	
Are you sending enough times per week/fortnight to keep the IPs warm?
If not, try other lifecycle use cases, and reach out to the postmaster to explain why you have sporadic sends.
What is the RPM being used?
If there are deferrals/delayed delivery/infrequent sends, lower the RPM.

Delivery rate	
What is the average delivery rate?
If it's below 98%, review the reasons behind it.
If there are high hard bounces, secure audience collection points, implement double opt it, send welcome campaigns, and look whether hard bounces are automatically suppressed as expected or not.
If there are high soft bounces, reach the error description, and fix it accordingly.

Deferrals	
Are there deferrals [event: Event Deferred]?
If yes, pause for a day and clear the queue, resume with lower volumes and low RPM, and reach out to postmaster support.

Open and click rate	
Are the Unique open rates across all ISPs on par with the benchmark?
If not, revise your sending strategy.

Spam complaints (Gmail)	
Is the spam rate higher than the threshold?
If yes, review the user-collection sources, check if the right expectations are being set, if the sending patterns are optimal, and if the content is relevant to the user.

Spam complaints (from the stats)	
Is the spam rate higher than the threshold?
If yes, review the user-collection sources, check if the right expectations are being set, if the sending patterns are optimal, and if the content is relevant to the user.

Domain and IP reputation (Gmail)	
Is the domain reputation LOW/BAD?
If yes, pause everything, investigate the root cause behind the drop, fix the underlying problem, reach out to Google Postmaster support, resume slowly, and ramp up.

SNDS status (Microsoft)	
Is the filtered status RED?
If yes, pause everything, investigate the root cause behind the drop, fix the underlying problem, reach out to Microsoft Postmaster support, resume slowly, and ramp up.

Inbox Placement	
Is the overall placement lower than 95%?
Is this low only for a specific domain?
Review all other metrics (performance, reputation, complaints) and fix accordingly.

Blocklists	
Are the IPs and domains in blocklists/blacklists?
Blocks identified by reviewing soft Bounce reason.
If yes, apply for removal.

Next Steps	
Review the trends going back 6 months, find the gaps, and optimize.
Follow best practices."

Best Practices Regarding Sending Patterns

Sending patterns depends on your business and industry. Follow the below best practices regarding the sending patterns related to email campaigns:

To keep the IP and domain warm, send at least 1 campaign to active users per week.
You can send one campaign only to active users per week regardless so the engagement rates are higher.
Send at least one campaign per month to the ramped-up volume.
Conversely, only ramp up to the volume you plan to send immediately and in the next 6-8 weeks.
Ramping up to a higher volume when you don’t plan to send such high volumes is a moot activity.
Lower the sender patterns based on engagement. This is mostly related to the E-Com business.
For most active users: send as required or 2 per week.
For less active users: slightly lower than most active users; one per week.
For new users: follow the onboarding flow or treat them as less active users.
For other users, who are not active recently but are not inactive yet:  Send targeted campaigns based on their previous history.
For inactive users, who have not engaged in more than 9 months: Suppress permanently and do not send to them."

Best Practices Regarding Request Per Minute (RPM)

RPM stands for 'requests per minute.' In email campaigns, this term refers to the number of emails sent per minute. Follow the below best practices regarding RPM.

During the warm-up phase, use an RPM of 1k only for the first 10 days, before slowly increasing it.
The warm-up plan includes RPM recommendations as well.
After ramping up, slowly increase RPM week on week.
If you are sending after a pause of more than 10 days, use low RPM and spread the volume over three hours.
Ideally, you should be able to send your entire volume within one hour or less. Configure RPM accordingly.
RPM * 60 = Volume delivered in an hour
If your RPM is low and your emails spread out a lot, slowly increase your RPM.
Give one week for each change to stabilize.
Monitor closely to ensure there are no deferrals.

Best Practices to be Followed for Unsubscribe Link

Follow the below best practices while adding an unsubscribe link in email campaigns:

Add unsubscribe link: Ensure that an unsubscribe link is included in all emails except transactional emails. The unsubscribe link within the email can also be your preference management page. For more information, refer to List-Unsubscribe Email.
Include list-unsubscribe headers: This must be included for all emails except transactional. This is a compliance requirement as per Gmail and Yahoo mandates in 2024. For more information on the list-unsubscribe email, refer here.
Ensure that the unsubscribe link is readily visible: End-users must easily find unsubscribe links or buttons; otherwise, they may report spam, impacting deliverability more negatively than unsubscribing.
Honor the unsubscribe requests: Ensure to honor unsubscribe within 2 days, if not immediately. While this is a regulatory ask in certain countries, it is as important from a customer experience standpoint.
MoEngage suppresses unsubscribed users in near real-time. If you manage unsubscribes and one-click unsubscribes directly, make sure to sync the data with MoEngage in real time."

Best Practices to be Followed for Segmentation Strategy

Segmentation strategy must continuously evolve as per the marketing needs and performance metrics. At the same time, segmentations must be dynamic to include new users and exclude unengaged ones. Follow the below best practices to get better results from your segmentation strategy:

Segment the audience based on user engagement activity such as active, less active, seasonal, inactive, etc. 
Tailor the send frequency that works for each different cohort as listed below:
For most active users send 3 to 4 emails a week
For less active users send 1 email a week
For seasonal users send emails once a month
For new users send emails as per the onboarding flow
For inactive users:
Send retargeting emails once a month.
Retire if they remain unengaged even after sending retargeting emails.
Sunset the inactive users:
Continued lack of activity may be because users no longer use that email address or might no longer be interested in the brand, or email communications.
Reach out to the users via other channels and stop sending emails to them.
Mailbox providers suspend unused mailboxes if they haven’t been used in a period. After bouncing them for a while, they convert them into spam traps. So, if the ISPs themselves have a sunsetting in place, it’s imperative that the senders/marketers also have these in place.

For example, if a user never opened the emails even after receiving dozens of emails in over 6 months, it’s best to send some other communication to them.
Limit the frequency of non-transactional emails.
If multiple event triggers and flow campaigns are active, users may receive multiple emails per day.
It’s best to limit non-transactional emails to a maximum of 1 per day or 2 per day.
You can ignore frequency capping for important campaigns such as policy change, purchase confirmation, and delivery updates."

Best Practices to be Followed for Warm Up

Follow the below best practices for Ramp Up

ISPs (Internet Service Providers) tend to have a low acceptance rate for emails from a new domain and IP. Hence, you need to start slow and steady to send emails to users who are likely to engage positively.
Follow the warm-up plan.
Send email campaigns to engaged users only, which include:
Email openers of the last 90 days
New users of the last 30 days
App/site openers of the last 60 days
Purchasers of the last 30 days
Remaining users
Follow the RPM recommendations as per the plan RPM (1k).
Send personalized event-triggered campaigns.
For the use cases for e-commerce lifecycle marketing campaigns, refer here.
Go slow in the first 7-10 days of warm-up.
If you see a drop in delivery rates, open rates, or reputation. Follow the below steps:
Pause ramp-up immediately for 3 days
Review the reputation
Change the template and run tests
Send only to email openers (has executed email opened at least two times in the last 60 days)
Review the reputation and resume slowly.
Don’t send the same email content repeatedly during the entire ramp-up process.
Keep changing email content.
Do not send the same email repeatedly to users.
Increase the pace of ramp-up based on performance.
Our standard ramp-up plan follows a medium pace. The volume increase is gradual which is not too fast or too slow.
Test what pace of email sending increment works for your brand and stick to it.
Don’t push more volume when there are negative signals (high spam complaints, rate-limiting, spam placement of emails, low delivery, drop in the opens, etc.)
Let the reputation stabilize at your general sending volume and frequency for at least 2 months post-ramp-up before you experiment.
Monitor very proactively during this period.
A stable reputation means good delivery, no rate-limiting, good and steady opens, low hard bounces/complaints, and a High domain reputation."

Best Practices to be Followed within an Email Body (HTML Guidelines)

Follow the below best practices within the email body before sending an email campaign:

Use multiple small images rather than one large image. Spammers generally tend to use one big image hence emails with just one image without any additional content may get flagged as spam.
Use text, images, buttons, and bullets as required.
Do not use link shorteners, such as https://bitly.com/ links. If the link shortener's domain reputation is bad, your emails could be affected. Furthermore, spammers often use link shorteners. If they use your preferred link shortener, it could negatively impact your emails.
Ensure to add a consistent footer with brand details. This helps improve trust with end recipients. Make sure to include the below details in the footer:
Brand name
Postal address of the company
Contact email or phone number
Brief detail on the brand
Privacy policy link
About us or Contact Us link
Working Unsubscribe link
Social media links/icons
Make sure the HTML size of your email body is less than 102 KB. Otherwise, it is clipped in Gmail. Follow the below points to avoid clipping in the Drag and Drop editor:
Use default fonts
Use padding instead of divider rows
Compress images
Inbox Service Providers such as Gmail and Yahoo block <svg> tag. You can use <img> tag instead of <svg> to render SVG images
Add more elements in the same row rather than adding multiple rows
Use <table> tag instead of CSS property flexbox so that the table gets rendered correctly in all the inbox providers
Don’t add separate rows for mobile-only and desktop-only
Reduce the number of links
Reduce the number of images - email size, in general,
Don’t have empty elements (empty rows, empty content)
To know more about CSS properties that are supported in Gmail, refer to CSS Support.
Make sure the email is visible without having to scroll. This improves engagement.
Make emails web and mobile/tablet screen-friendly as most people use emails on their phones.
Horizontal scrolling should not be required as it is a bad user experience.
HTML should render as expected in dark mode.
Do not add links to the background image. This creates accidental clicks when the user might only be trying to scroll and is a bad experience overall.
Add CTA wherever required. Reduce the number of clickable links other than the header and footer to 3 to 5 links.
Not all images might need a link.
Do not over-add links. This bloats the overall email size and increases the chances of clipping.
Include text in emails.
Maintain a 60:40, text-to-image ratio.
Add alternate text for images, so that your users could still know what you meant to include if images are turned off.

This improves accessibility for visually impaired recipients.
This makes the text easier to read via Siri and Alexa.
Use clear and uncomplicated language. This ensures that the email is easy to read and understand.
Do not use too many capital letters or exclamations, as it looks suspicious.
Experiment using the A/B test to check users’s preferences on certain HTML formats/elements, etc.
Try theme-based content
Mostly relevant to ECOMs and OTTs.
Try themes based on popular shows/movies, and holidays.

Best Practices to be Followed While Creating Subject Line and Sender address

Following the best practices while creating a subject line and sender address can increase the credibility of your emails, reduce spam reports, and ultimately improve the performance of your email marketing campaigns.

Follow the below best practices while creating subject lines:

Limit the number of characters in the subject line (including spaces) to less than 80 characters.
This makes it quick to read and also fits mobile screens well.
Make sure the subject line is contextually in line with the overall email.
A subject line should not set wrong expectations.
Use emojis to make the subject lines more interesting/appealing to recipients, but do not overdo it.
Do not use redundant words, too many capital-lettered words, or repeated special characters (e.g. !!!, ??, $$$).
This may look suspicious and, depending on the brand, a bit immature.
Use personalization (including content, offer, and context) as much as possible, this increases the probability or likelihood of the customer opening the email.
Use annotations and cards. It highlights the email in the promotions tab in the mobile app.
Use Subject lines to complement the cards.
Avoid sensitive data (for example - “Dear John, your XXXX points of ACME Inc voucher is expiring in 5 days.”).
Sharing sensitive data in the subject line can cause privacy issues.

Follow the below best practices while creating from name:

Recipients of the mail, see the From name in the list of emails, and not the entire address.
Make sure the From name clearly indicates the sender.
Brand names are preferred as From names.
Depending on the use case - for example - a change in policy, the below format can also be used for “From Name”, especially if the email is signed with a person’s name at the end.

Best Practices to be Followed While Collecting User Emails

Unsecure and non-transparent collection of user emails results in bad-quality data. This may also cause other frequent and repeated issues with email campaigns and domain reputation. Ensure to follow the below best practices while collecting user emails:

Collect user emails from organic users who have explicitly given consent. Below are two methods to get consent from the users.
Double opt-in method: In this method, when a customer signs up with your brand a verification email will be sent to them. After the customer clicks on the verification link, you can send emails to them.
Single opt-in with a Captcha: In this method, the customer is asked to re-enter the email address to avoid typos also captcha prevents the bot signups. You can also integrate with a real-time list validation service to verify email at the sign-up page.
Be transparent and set correct expectations with your customers while collecting user emails.
Let your customer be aware of the following:
The reason for collecting their email addresses
What you will do with the collected data
With whom the data will be shared
The type of communication you send them and the frequency of engagement.
Make sure not to auto-select Send me marketing/promotional/newsletters/etc option when users need to input an email address for any transaction.
Do not purchase lists, scrape email addresses, etc - i.e. do not send emails to people who have not explicitly consented to receive them.
Make sure to be compliant with user collection or data privacy laws in your country. Some of the data privacy law include:
U’s Digital Service Act (DSA) & Digital Market Act (DMA) from 2024
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, May 25, 2018)
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA, January 1, 2020)

Best Practices for Email Deliverability

Follow the below best practices to achieve and maintain good email deliverability.

Optimal Set up:
Make sure you are compliant and your email setup is correct.
Check for compliance.
Test email set up.
Ensure audience collection points are clean.
Use double opt-in, if possible.
If not, use a single opt-in with captch at the signup point to avoid bot signups.
Do not send marketing/promotions to users if they have not explicitly signed up.
Check user collection best practices.
Ensure email send frequency is proportional to end user’s engagement levels.
Send less frequently to less engaged users.
Consider retargeting campaigns for unengaged users.
Use Frequency capping to limit the emails sent per user per day/week.
Sending too frequently results in user fatigue which increases spam complaints and unsubscribed.
Set correct expectations and be open and clear.
Set correct expectations while collecting users and stick to those.
Subject lines and pre-header text must never mislead the users about the content of the email.
Steady Sending patterns
Maintain steady sending patterns to ensure IP and domain remain warmed up.
Send at least 1 campaign a week to active users.
Send at least 1 campaign every 2-3 weeks to the ramped-up volume / all opted-in users [barring the suppressed inactive users].
Make sure you are warmed up to send the intended volume.
Check warm-up best practices.
Use the correct RPM to throttle the emails.
If you send too fast without ramping up, it will result in delivery issues.
Refer to RPM recommendations.
Do not suddenly increase volume.
Peak season campaigns tend to include less active/inactive users.
Prepare for peak season mailings at least 6 weeks in advance.
Important announcements can be sudden.
Make sure these are text-only and throttled/split over the day/s well.
Ramp-up instead of resuming after inactivity.
IPs and domains get cold when inactive.
Start slowly by sending to highly engaged users.
Slowly expand to other users with lower email engagement.
Do not send higher volumes at once.
Send to email openers only, with higher throttling (low RPM).
Dynamic Strategy
Maintain a 70:30 ratio for Active v/s Inactive Users.
The major portion of the target criteria should be active users.
This helps keep the overall negative engagement low.
Send event-based personalized campaigns like event-triggered and flow campaigns.
Use cases for e-commerce brands can be found here.
Make sure content is relevant to the users.
Sending irrelevant content makes people lose interest in the sender.
If engagement levels drop, reduce send frequency and send targeted content.
Survey to find reasons for disinterest.
Suppress inactive users if there has been no engagement in 6+ months (or less/more depending on the industry.)
ISPs like Comcast, Yahoo, and so on, disable unused mailboxes.
If mailbox providers themselves have policies to suspend users, it’s imperative that the sender also have strategies to suppress them.
Monitor and Revise
In case of issues:
Deferrals i.e. rate limited by ISP.
Use lower RPM
Look into sending patterns.
Pause for a day, let the IPs rest, and raise a ticket with postmaster support.
High user-reported spam complaints/unsubscribes:
Reduce sending frequency
Check whether the content is relevant to each segment.
Low opens/clicks
Send only to email openers
Review the target audience
Review FC settings
Ensure content v/s segment relevancy.
Pause and monitor.

FAQs
FAQ Regarding Ramp Up
Are Warm Up and Ramp Up the same?

No, refer to the here to view the differences.

Why do you need to warm-up?

ISPs are skeptics at best when it comes to deciding on email inbox placement. While authentication (DKIM and SPF setup) is important, it is not enough for the ISPs to trust you. It needs to be built gradually by ensuring high engagement in your emails. Emails coming from a new IP/domain that hasn't built a good reputation as yet, ISPs might choose to handle your emails as below:

Only accept a small number of emails
Receive emails at a slow pace
Put all the emails in the spam folder
Put the first few emails in the inbox, monitor the engagement from the initial recipients, and then determine where to put the remaining emails.
Block emails from you, if you try to send more than a smaller number
info	

Information

Your reputation with the ISPs can take a hit with even a single bad campaign. Recovering from such a setback can take anywhere between 4 to 8 weeks.

How to warm-up?

As part of the warm-up, you will need to send relevant emails to a small volume of users who are most likely to engage. The exact amount of time required to do this will depend on the current reputation of your domain/IP and the performance of your campaigns. Below stated are some high-level guidelines:

Send lower volumes to begin with, increase them gradually, and throttle your campaigns. Don’t worry about scaling up initially; instead, focus on generating positive engagement.
Send to users who are most likely to engage positively.
Pay attention to performance metrics, viz. delivery rate, open rate, click rate, spam complaints, and unsubscribes. Course correct based on your observations.
Check your reputation on postmaster sites, and inbox placement data on third-party sites. Course correct based on your observations.
Monitor your performance metrics and reputation closely for the first ten days. Once your reputation is stable, move to ramp up.
Why do you need to ramp up?

After building a good reputation, you need to increase the sending volume until you reach your daily average. And that’s ramp-up! While warm-up is slow, ramp-up tends to be faster. The pace of ramp-up, however, should be determined based on the campaigns' performance and domain/IP reputation during warm-up.

If they're excellent, you can ramp up much faster and take some calculated risks.
If they're average, ramp up at a breathable pace, and progress cautiously.
If either of them is bad, fix it first.
How should you ramp up?

Increase your daily sending volume by 30% to 50% each day. Ensure that your performance doesn't drop and that the domain and IP reputation stays consistent.

What volume should you ramp up to?

Your intended daily, weekly, or monthly volume defines the volume you should ramp up to. For example:

User Base	Peak Volume	Ramp Up Plan
100K	100K	Ramp up to 100K.
100K	50K	Ramp up to 50K.
100K	The general sending volume is 20K. Once a month, 100K.	For general sending volume, 20K ramp-up will suffice. For the monthly 100K send, you will need to use a segmented strategy.

 

info	

Information

IPs start getting cold after two weeks, and thus higher infrequent volumes will require special handling.

ppp

How to control the volume during ramp-up?

Controlling the volume can be done in multiple ways:

Create smaller segments based on the daily prescribed volume.
Use control groups while creating campaigns.
If applicable, we will also enable back-end limits.
What is a scale-up plan? Is this different from ramp-up?

While ramp-ups are done at the time of onboarding, scale-ups address the seasonality in sales that most businesses observe. The marketing efforts, as a result, also need to follow the same cycles. In peak seasons, your sending volumes can be higher than usual. To meet the same, the email sends need to be increased to those levels. This is known as a scale-up and is done in the weeks leading to the peak.

Typically, a larger user base at such times includes lesser engaged users, and hence an integral part of the scale-up becomes segmenting such inactive users based on their last activity, inactivity, sign-up date, sign-up source, and so on. This helps avoid any negative impact of the scale-up on your domain's/IP's reputation.

If you have 90k data, but your ramp-up plan is 150k. How do you get 150k data?
The ramp-up plan remains the same.
Backend limits do not need to be revised.
Follow the plan till 90k and ask for backend limits to be disabled
What steps can be taken when the open rates of your emails are dropping?
Pause all campaigns for 3 days. Take this time to investigate the reason behind the open rates drop.
Review the reputation and all the metrics.
Revise the template.
Test the new template.
Send only to email openers for the next 2 campaigns.

If things are fine, resume ramp-up. Otherwise deep dive and resolve the issues before confirming.
Note that campaigns sent only to less active or inactive users are expected to have low opens.

What steps can be taken, if you do not have data to ramp up?
Create Event Triggered and Flow campaigns.
Ramp up with “delivered” volume.
Make sure to set correct expectations.
How will your ramp up get completed if you cannot send campaign everyday?

Follow the below steps to complete your ramp up if you cannot send campaign everyday

Try sending at least 2 campaigns per week.
You can also send 1 campaign per week but to different users - this way the recipients will receive only 1 campaign per week but the number of ramp-up sends per week will be more. This way the ramp-up can be completed faster.
Use proper exclusions during ramp-up.
How should you suppress out-outs, if you cannot pull users from the old vendor for suppression?
When you pull opted-in data, try pulling openers first excluding suppression data in the old vendor.
When you pull “all users” data, make sure to exclude all the suppression data/BUC data in the old vendor, and then export the list.
Start with a welcome campaign first from MOE. Start multiple event-triggered and flow campaigns.
Ramp-up with MOE opened and delivered users.
Target app/site openers.
What should be your exclusion criteria?
EXCLUDE criteria must use OR condition in UI. Audience criteria should have an “AND” condition and exclusion criteria must have an “OR” condition.
Exclude suppression data
Exclude soft bounces (has executed email soft bounced at least 1 time in the last 60 days)
BUC (Hard Bounces, Unsubscribes, Spam Complaints) users get suppressed by default.
If the opener data is low, will it have an impact on the ramp-up process?

This likely means that you had deliverability issues with the previous vendor. To prevent this from affecting your ramp-up process, you can follow the steps outlined below:

Send campaigns for the first 7 days to openers' data only. Even if you can not increase the volume.
Once reputation data is available (and reputation is HIGH), then you can slowly ramp up with additional data. Send to new users first before bringing in users from the old vendor.
Reduce send frequency to 2 emails per user per week.
This is because the quality of users is unknown. So, better to start slowly and then move up if needed.
Send Event-triggered campaigns.
How to resolve, if your complaints rates are high?

This indicates users do not want your emails. Follow the below steps to resolve this issue.

Pause all campaigns for a week.
Review the segmentation v/s content and ensure email content is relevant to users.
Reduce the send frequency to 2 emails per user per week.
Start a welcome flow. Make sure to set correct expectations.
Review how the users are collected.
Did they explicitly sign up?
Were they forced to share their email ID to perform certain transactions?
After the email ID was collected, did you allow the user to choose their email preferences?
How should you manage your unsubscribe data during migration?
Sync the unsubscribes between two vendors
Move the users to MoEngage and don’t move them back to the old vendor
Sync unsubscribes regularly throughout the ramp-up duration.
Will your ramp-up be affected if you send emails to inactive users during the later half of the process when a higher volume is required?

Ramp-up should only happen until the volume you usually send to. If you usually do not send to inactive users then your volume would be lower. Hence, you need not send higher volumes. Ramp-up doesn’t mean you have to send emails to all users in your database irrespective of their activity.

 

How do I ramp up without increasing the number of emails per user if I typically only send weekly emails?

Suppose your campaign strategy involves sending only weekly emails. In that case, you can speed up your ramp-up phase by sending out the same weekly campaign daily during the initial two to three weeks, but ensure it reaches unique users each time. You need to use proper exclusions to ensure each user receives only one email each week from either of your vendors.
This method helps increase your operations swiftly while still adhering to the once-per-week email frequency for each user. However, it's important to note that through this method, the exact day of the week each user receives an email may vary during this two to three-week phase.

The same would be the case for monthly campaigns well.

 

Post-ramp-up: How can I sustain my ramped-up state or reputation with only monthly campaigns?

If you only have monthly sends, it could be suggested that you send all event-triggered, flows, one-time, and periodic campaigns i.e. all non-transactional emails, from the same sub-domain/IP.

Apart from this, create a personalized weekly periodic campaign with the below details.

Dynamic users, such as ""has executed app/site open at least 1 time in the last 7 days"" for E-commerce brands.
Should be periodic repeating weekly
Use content personalization.

Maintaining weekly personalized event-based campaigns can have several beneficial impacts:

It helps maintain the domain's reputation and prevents IPs from cooling off.
Engages active users of the app.
Assists in maintaining a good reputation as personalized event-based campaigns generally perform well.
Keeps 'interested' users engaged and incentivises conversion.

For the monthly planned email, which presumably would have a significantly larger volume than weekly sends, you should split this into multiple segments. To prevent spikes in volumes, you should spread the volume across different times of the day, and even multiple days.

Additionally, you should use BTS to send high-volume email campaigns throughout the day."

There are no significant technical disadvantages of using your own provider apart from the lack of hand-holding and deliverability support throughout the process.

Also, the MoEngage team troubleshoots and manages issues with the vendor.




Shared IPs

	

No.

	Yes


Full access to the Vendor

	

No, but typically, you may not require full access because all the data will be in the MoEngage workplace.

	Yes

 

Can I migrate the same domain and IP to MoEngage Sendgrid?

Yes, MoEngage can migrate domains, which can be used simultaneously in different ESPs. If the IPs are dedicated IPs in Sendgrid, those can also be migrated. For more information, refer to SendGrid IP Migration.

I am getting SMTP failures while sending emails from the MoEngage connector. What does it mean?

The error code should have an error description. Alternatively, you can ask the support team to export the exact SMTP description and raise a support ticket to help resolve the issue. Some of the common error messages are described below.

Error Message	Reason for the Error	Resolution


Email address not verified.

 

	This happens when the from address or from domain is not validated.	You must validate the domain with the email provider (generate and add DNS records) or verify the from address with the email provider.
SMTP service disconnected.	This happens when the SMTP connection is not successfully established with the sending server, which could happen if the SMTP account is deleted.	

Check the email settings and the associated account or sub-account with the email provider.


SMTP account not activated. 	This happens when the SMTP account in Sendinblue is not activated or the activation timeline has expired.	

Activate the account with SendinBlue - check with SendinBlue support


Throttling failure: Maximum sending rate exceeded	This happens when you send emails at a rate higher than the sending rates set at Amazon SES.	

Throttle the campaign and increase the sending limits on SES.


Throttling failure: Daily message quota exceeded	This happens when the maximum daily send limit set on SES has been exceeded. This will refresh at midnight.	

Increase the sending quota on SES.


Message rejected: Sending paused for this account. For more information, please check the inbox of the email address associated with your AWS account.	This happens when the account is suspended or paused.	

Check the SES UI to know the reason behind this error and contact SES support to resolve this error.


Authentication failed: Basic authentication is not allowed with 2FA enabled.	This happens when the Sendgrid account has 2FA enabled, so emails will be accepted only from pre-verified sources.	

Disable Allow List in SendGrid or contact your customer success team to enable the NAT flow.


Invalid Sending Pool Name: IP Pool is not valid, or no available IPs are found in the pool.	This happens when the IP pool associated with the domain/sender doesn't exist, or contains no IPs	

Check the configuration on SES and ensure the IP/IP pool assignment is correct."

FAQ Regarding Google Postmaster Data

This article covers the most common questions about Google Postmaster data.

Why can't I view domain reputation data in the MoEngage UI, even though it is available in Google Postmaster?

In case you do not see domain reputation data in MoEngage UI, check for the following:

Check if you have provided access to MoEngage for that domain.

If not, MoEngage may not have access to pull domain reputation.

Check if you are sending emails to @gmail.com users from that domain.

If not, there won’t be domain reputation data to display.

Check if emails are authenticated, i.e., the DKIM domain is the same as your “from the domain.”

If not, there won’t be domain reputation data to display.

Check if you can see the domain reputation in Postmaster.
If not, there might be a global outage, or you might not have sent emails from DKIM-signed domains, as mentioned above.
Check if you added the domain in less than 2 days.
If domains are added in the MoEngage UI and/or access was shared less than 2 days ago, the system may not have pulled the data yet, and it will be fetched in the next run.
Why can I not see domain reputation data after setting up a Google Postmaster account?

Domain reputation data is only available:

If you send emails from DKIM-signed domains. Note that the domain reputation data is unavailable when you send emails from a non-authenticated domain or use a different DKIM domain.
If you send sufficient volume to the @gmail.com domain. Gmail has not published a minimum number of emails required; 500 emails at @gmail.com is a good approximation for the minimum required volume.
Domain reputation data only populates after 2 days. For example, reputation data for 1/20 will only be available on 1/22 or later.
Why domain reputation data is missing from my Google Postmaster account?

Sometimes, data might be missing from Google Postmaster for every user. This typically happens globally. The deliverability team of MoEngage sends feedback to Gmail. Google might populate the data later or skip it altogether.

Why am I not able to view data on spam-compliant rates?

Data on spam complaint rates only appears in Gmail.

You won't be able to view the spam-compliant rate data in the campaign analytics as Gmail doesn’t send this data back to the senders like in a traditional feedback loop.
The spam rate in Google Postmaster is not a spam folder placement rate. It is the percentage of users who have received emails from that domain in their Inbox and reported them as spam."

FAQs
FAQ Regarding Email Delivery Rates
What is the threshold for bounces after which my reputation is affected?

There is no specific threshold for bounces. Ideally, most email senders can achieve delivery rates of 98-99%, which is also the case with most MoEngage customers.
High bounce rates can be due to hard bounces caused by invalid email addresses. This indicates poor email list quality, and over time, it can negatively impact reputation, particularly if the rate of hard bounces exceeds 1% per day.

Is there a possibility that MoEngage and Email Service Provider (SendGrid, Amazon SES) dashboards indicate an email is delivered even if the intended recipient does not receive it?

Yes, emails get marked as Delivered once the recipient email server accepts the request to deliver the email. It is possible that mail clients (gmail, yahoo etc.) may not deliver the email to the recipient even after sending the delivery callback to ESPs (SendGrid, Amazon SES). In such cases, details related to delivery can only be established by reaching out to the mail client in question.

Are there rules to be maintained to reduce the hard bounce rate?


No explicit or exact rules must be maintained to reduce the hard bounce rate. But if you experience a daily hard bounce rate of 10%, this significantly impacts your reputation much sooner than a daily hard bounce rate of 1%.
Double-opt-in, welcome, and sign-up campaigns typically encounter high hard bounce rates, such as 3–5% daily, without significant issues. This is expected when you send the first email to a new customer.

What causes soft bounces?

Soft bounces occur due to poor list quality and reputation issues, such as a full mailbox, unreachable smaller domains, or IP blocks. You must suppress soft bounces that occur repeatedly but are not a result of IP or domain blocks.

How does soft bounce affect my reputation?

A sender with below-average email list quality often experiences frequent blocks. Ultimately, reputation is affected by your audience's quality and your sending behavior.
You must aim for a 99% delivery rate, excluding the sign-up/welcome campaigns. You must also have a sign-up or welcome campaign that cleans any new audiences added to your database. Monitor and request email removal from the database or mailing list whenever an IP/domain block occurs.

Does MoEngage support email address validation?

Currently, MoEngage does not have in-house support for this and is yet to partner with third-party email validation vendors. If you wish to clean your email list using a third-party email validation tool, you must manage it independently. Some examples of such tools include Email List Verify, NeverBounce, ZeroBounce, Kleanmail, Verifybee, and BriteVerify.
Note that Sendgrid offers email list validation.

Can we send emails to the purchased lists?

No, you cannot send emails to the purchased list. Sending emails to users who have not expressed consent can impact delivery and deliverability. Most countries also have strict mailing and privacy laws, which make sending without consent a punishable offense.

Can we send emails to cold users?

MoEngage does not recommend sending emails to cold users. 

Depending on the country (GDPR mandates the deletion of user accounts and data after 18 months of inactivity) and without legal restrictions, cold users can be targeted carefully. However, it is advisable to approach this strategy in smaller volumes and mitigate any potential impact on deliverability over an extended period. You must consult with your email deliverability consultant to develop a plan accordingly.

What is throttling?

Throttling is a method of slowing down the speed at which emails are sent, ensuring a consistent pace per minute rather than delivering the entire volume at once. If throttling measures are not implemented, MoEngage attempts to send emails rapidly. Use Request Per Minute (RPM) to throttle your campaigns and send them steadily. For more information, refer to Throttling.

How does campaign throttling help?

Throttling contributes to improved email delivery. By default, most systems are designed to send emails at once. For instance, if you send a batch of 1 million emails, MoEngage attempts to deliver them all simultaneously. However, this approach can lead to problems like rate-limiting imposed by ISPs, resulting in delivery delays, minor IP blocks, or even temporary blocks due to rate limitations. In some cases, higher rate-limiting and subsequent retries may be interpreted by ISPs as Namespace Mining behavior, potentially resulting in a significant IP block.
However, by implementing throttling at a rate of, let's say, 10K RPM (emails per minute), the 1 million emails can be sent steadily over an hour and a half, thereby avoiding the issues mentioned above. Throttling all campaigns is considered a best practice. Depending on the client, volume, and system stability, the throttling rate can gradually increase as the volume increases.
Throttling is crucial for new senders, as ISPs (such as Yahoo) tend to impose volume rate limits on new IP addresses. Implementing throttling from MoEngage helps facilitate a faster warming-up and minimizes Yahoo issues."

Email Delivery Rates
Overview

Email Delivery Rate is the ratio of the number of emails that were successfully accepted by the recipient server to the number of emails that were sent.

info	

Information

The email delivery rate is calculated as follows:


Email Delivery Rate = [#Delivered emails/ #Sent emails]*100
Email Delivery Rate = [(#Sent emails - #Bounced emails)/ #Sent emails]*100
Reasons for Low Email Delivery Rate

The reasons for a low email delivery rate are as follows:

Hard Bounces

If an email address or domain doesn't exist, it is classified as a hard bounce. A high hard bounce rate indicates that your email list quality is bad and many of your users don't have a valid email address. Hard bounces may also occur due to the following reasons:

Unsecure audience collection
Lack of overall list hygiene.

In MoEngage, all users marked as hard bounces are suppressed from all future mailings. 

Soft Bounces 

These occur due to temporary failures such as a full mailbox, a recipient’s domain being unavailable or unreachable, IP or domain blocks, emails being blocked due to content getting flagged as spam, or blocks due to the low reputation of the domain/IP. Soft bounces indicate a temporary issue with email delivery, which can be resolved later. High soft bounces result from bad list quality and/or bad sending practices.
In MoEngage, users marked as soft bounces are not suppressed from future mailings. 

Deferrals

This is a transient state where an email was sent, that is, a delivery attempt was made, but it was not delivered or failed. The recipient server responded that the server was busy or the IP was rate limited/throttled and retried later. So, the MoEngage system retries these emails until they are delivered or failed (bounce).

Email deferral is not the final state of the email. It gets delivered or bounced with subsequent reattempts until the pre-configured bounce-after period, typically 72 hours for Sendgrid and 14 hours for Amazon SES. So, after 72 hours of the first delivery attempt, if the email is still in the queue, it will be marked as a soft bounce.

Deferral is the intermittent event between the sent and the outcome of that sent, which can be delivered or bounced. Also, one sent event can have multiple deferrals. In contrast, one sent event can only have one of the delivered or bounced events.

Lateral Bounces 

These are exceptional cases where the recipient servers initially accept the emails (delivered) and then reject them later. This usually occurs due to a misconfiguration in the recipient servers' incoming mail handling settings.

Improve Delivery Rates

Hard and soft bounces are the primary reasons behind low delivery rates; decreasing their number helps improve your delivery rates.

Reduce Hard Bounce

A high hard bounce rate indicates that your email list is old and/or is not getting cleaned regularly. Perform the following steps to reduce hard bounces:

 Verify that the auto-suppression mechanism for hard bounces works as expected.
Check the audience collection points. For new customers, secure your list collection points to ensure that valid email addresses are collected. You can use double opt-ins or captchas in the sign-up form or ask the customer to re-enter the email address to avoid typos.
Remove old unengaged users regardless of whether the email address is valid after some inactivity (say 9 months).
Clean the database using a third-party service if you haven't sent emails in a long time or have offline signups.
Send a welcome campaign to new users.
Abstain from purchasing lists.
Reduce Soft Bounce

Perform the following steps to reduce soft bounces:

Make sure hard bounces are low.
Ensure domain and IP reputation is either medium or high.
Check for IP blocks and apply for remediation. Suppress users from those domains until the blocks are lifted.
Suppress users who continuously soft bounce due to the mailbox being unavailable or full.
Test the email content (HTML) and make sure that it is getting filtered out by spam filters.
info	

Information

You can get a consistent 99% delivery rate with good audience quality and good sending behavior. 

Reduce Deferrals
Warm up and Ramp up emails correctly for new senders.
Existing senders should refrain from causing sudden volume spikes.
Use low Request Per Minute (RPM) to throttle all one-time campaigns.
Use Best time to send (BTS) for higher volume campaigns, especially if you send high volumes infrequently.
Ensure the number of IPs is adequate to support the volumes, especially for regional domains.
If you see any issues, pause and send a smaller volume to previous email openers, and then scale up properly before the issue escalates.

Self Debugging Email Deliverability Issues

The below listed points help you to self-debug email deliverability problems.

Check if all the compliance requirements are met. Expected results are:

SPF, DKIM, DMARC pass

DMARC policy [p=reject]

List-Unsubscribe header

In-body unsubscribe link

Check if the email setup is intact.
Look for any volume spikes. Expected results are:
Consistent volume pattern while looking at week-by-week summary.
No unusual volume spike (more than 1x growth compared to the highest volume in the last 30 days) in any day.
Less than 10 10-day gap between (high volume) sends.
Less than 3 weeks gap in between high volume sends
Ramp-up should be as per the plan, if in the ramp-up phase.
Look for any unusual target segment such as inactive users targeting, missing suppressions, or the presence of unusual emails in the list. Expected results are:
Optimal active v/s inactive targeting: 70:30.
Proper suppressions and frequency capping exclusions.
No inactive users (6+ months) in the usual target segment.
Check if there has been any suspicious sign-up. For example, a sudden spike in welcome campaign volume would be suspicious. Unless there is an activity going on or it’s the peak sale season, there should not be a more than +- 20% difference in the usual welcome campaign volume. Expected results are:
No unusual sign-up activity
No bot signups
No unusual app/site activity
Check postmaster data for reputation at Gmail; check SNDS for IP status at Microsoft. Expected results are:
HIGH reputation at Gmail
Less than 0.1 % of users reported spam on Gmail
Green-filtered results at SNDS
Check the performance metrics for the last 15 days, weekly performance going back 90 days, and monthly performance going back 6 months. Expected results are:
More than 99% delivered rate, except for the Welcome campaign or double opt-in campaign.
More than 30% unique open rates. Consistent through weeks for each segment group - active, inactive, personalized, triggered, etc.
Stable click rate - consistent through weeks for each segment group - active, inactive, personalized, triggered, etc.
Low complaint rates (<0.1%)
Low unsubscribe rates (<0.5%)
Consistent conversion rates from week to week for each campaign or segment group.
Consistent performance for each triggered campaign or flow campaign.
No deferrals.
Read all the failure reasons to see if there were any blocks due to IPs/domains being in block lists or due to low reputation. Expected results are:
No soft bounces due to IP/domain blocks or mailbox provider blocks.
Check the HTML content. Expected results are:
No personalization failures
No distorted or poorly formatted emails
No spam-like content
Personalized or segmented for each send
Light images or videos that load quickly
Consistent branding in emails.

After you spot the issues, go into the repair mode, then slowly test and resume sending smaller volumes to the most engaged users at a low RPM and then ramp up."

Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI)
Overview

BIMI is an emerging technology that is built on top of the DMARC.

Unlike, adding a profile picture for from address, BIMI comes with a trademarked logo for the domain which shows up across all ISPs that support BIMI (Gmail, Yahoo, Proofpoint, etc.). The BIMI logo is also an additional form of branding and proving the sender’s authenticity.

Configure BIMI for your Brand

Follow the below steps to configure BIMI for your brand, thereby cultivating immediate brand recognition and enhancing user experience:

Inspect if your domain meets the standards for BIMI. For more information, refer here.
The root domain and sub-domain must have strict (reject or quarantine, with pct=100) DMARC. The root domain must also have SPF and MX records. For more information, refer here.
For example,
	host -t txt _dmarc.moengage.com

	_dmarc.moengage.com descriptive text ""v=DMARC1; p=reject; sp=reject; pct=100; rua=mailto:dmarc@moengage.com; ruf=mailto:dmarc@moengage.com; fo=1""
Trademark your brand logo.
Create an SVG file for your trademarked brand logo and upload it on the web server. Example: MoEngage Logo, Uber Logo.

Get a VMC for your brand logo

Apply for VMC.

Currently, acceptable VMC providers are - Entrust DataCard and DigiCert. Gmail only shows the brand logo in Inbox if certified VMC is present. While some email clients make VMC optional, Gmail needs it for BIMI to work.
Create and publish the BIMI record. You can also inspect your BIMI record and other prerequisites here.
The logo might take 2-3 days to appear in emails sent.
Why is BIMI important?

BIMI is a way of establishing visual identity. Since BIMI enforcement requires strict authentication, it also helps prevent spoofing of your brand domain.

Since BIMI is built on top of DMARC, the root domain and sub-domains must have a strict DMARC policy, which prevents domain spoofing.
Having a brand logo display on the user’s inbox always boosts authenticity and can improve trust and thus engagement.
Gmail has now (May 23) introduced a verified blue tick checkmark for BIMI users, which is an indication of authenticity that generally everyone is used to. This again separates the “authentic” senders from others and builds trust amongst customers.
Indirectly, keeping up with the evolving technologies, especially those built on strict authentication policies and branding, is a good indication to the ISPs that you are up to date and in line with the best practices.
Blue Verified Tick

As BIMI is built on top of DMARC and authentications, few MBPs have introduced additional visual branding on top of BIMI. All the domains that have valid BIMI configured will now see a Blue Tick on the sender name as shown below.

Avoid Spam Traps
Overview

Spam traps are honeypot addresses created or repurposed by mailbox providers to assess the email list management practices of email senders. Spam trap addresses are valid, so emails are delivered to them, but they never engage with the emails.
The main purpose of spam traps is to catch spammers or senders with poor list management. There are three types of traps:

Pristine traps: These traps flag senders who send unsolicited emails. A pristine spam trap is an email address that a real person has never used and is created solely to identify spam emails.
Recycled traps: These traps flag senders who do not maintain list hygiene. Recycled traps are old email addresses that mailbox providers converted into traps after the users abandoned them and bounced for a while.
Typo traps:  These traps flag senders who do follow email best practices. Typo traps are addresses with typos on major domains like gail.com, yaho.com, or homail.com. Email senders implementing confirmed opt-in and sunsetting inactive users should not hit these traps.
Reasons for Spam Traps Getting into the Email List

Spam traps never sign up for emails or engage with emails. They can infiltrate your email list in several ways. A few of these are:

If you collect users through purchasing lists, social media scraping, or any sort of explicit signup, you are likely to hit traps.
If you do not permanently suppress users who have bounced, you are likely to hit recycled traps. Usually, when changing vendors, if you do not suppress previous-suppressed users, they might get into your list.
If you do not sunset unengaged users, the traps in your list continue to grow.
Impact of Hitting Spam Traps

Senders who follow list management best practices should not hit spam traps. Hence, senders who consistently hit spam traps may be perceived as spammers. Essentially, in varying degrees, the impact could be:

Delayed delivery (emails being rate-limited and deferred)
Low delivery (emails being soft bounced)
Low engagement (emails might be sent to spam)
Drop in the domain and IP reputation
Preventive Measures to Avoid Spam Traps

To prevent spam traps from getting into the database and that number from growing, follow the management best practices listed below:

Ensure user collection methods are clean.
Suppress hard bounce immediately. Ensure these remain suppressed even when migrating to a different vendor. To know how to suppress hard bounce, refer here.
Sunset inactive users after 9 months of inactivity and permanently suppress them from emails"

FAQs - Email
What is Bot Activity in Email Marketing?
Overview

Bot activity in emails refers to automated programs or scripts that interact with email campaigns in a way that mimics human behavior. These bots can perform various actions, such as opening emails, clicking links, filling out forms, or marking emails as spam. The purpose of bot activity can range from benign, such as email security scanners checking links for malicious content or email analytics services tracking engagement, to malicious, such as creating fake sign-ups, skewing marketing data, or conducting email-based phishing attacks.

Bots are not actual subscribers, so their actions result in misleading data and negatively impact the effectiveness and accuracy of email marketing efforts. Identifying and filtering out bot activity is essential for email marketers to maintain a realistic understanding of their campaign performance and audience engagement.

Bot Actions on Emails

Bots can perform a variety of actions on emails, including but not limited to:

Opening emails: Bots can automatically open emails, potentially inflating open rate metrics.
Clicking links: Bots can click links within emails, skewing click-through rate data and leading to incorrect conclusions about subscriber engagement.
Marking as spam: Some bots may be programmed to mark emails as spam, damaging the sender's reputation with email service providers and affecting deliverability.
Unsubscribing: Bots can automatically unsubscribe from email lists, harming the mailing list of a brand.

Not all reasons behind bot activity are sinister. There are scenarios where bot opens are a side effect of a feature intended to improve email users’ lives. Some examples are:

Mail Privacy Protection (MPP): This was a feature introduced by Apple in its iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey updates, primarily affecting the native Mail app. MPP masks users’ IP addresses and loads remote content privately in the background, essentially pre-fetching email content as soon as it reaches the inbox. Pre-fetching email content makes it difficult for email senders to track opens accurately since emails are automatically opened regardless of user engagement. For more information, refer to Mail Privacy Protection (MPP) and Email Analytics.
Image pre-fetches / security checks done by mailbox providers: In an attempt to load the emails faster or validate the links included in the email for security, mailbox providers also tend to download content, which can result in pseudo-open signals being sent back to the marketing platforms.
Impacts of Bot Activity on Email Marketing
Distorted engagement metrics: Bots can generate fake opens and clicks, leading to inflated engagement metrics that do not accurately reflect an email campaign's performance.
Increased spam complaints: If bots are programmed to mark emails as spam, it can lead to an increase in spam complaints, harming the sender's reputation.
Reduced reach: Bots that result in unintended unsubscribes can seriously impact the reachable users. This results in the effort, time, and energy spent building a mailing list going to waste.
Decreased deliverability: High unsubscribes and spam complaints due to bot activity can negatively impact the sender's email deliverability and reputation with internet service providers.
Skewed A/B testing results: Bot activity can interfere with A/B testing by generating false positives, leading to incorrect conclusions and suboptimal campaign decisions.
Track Bot Activity on Email Campaigns by MoEngage

Through various measures, MoEngage can differentiate between bot email opens and ones coming from real end users. Tracking bot activity can help marketers understand the impact of the machine opens in the engagement analytics and measure authentic user opens. For more information on these metrics, refer to Email Campaign Analytics and Info."

How to Find Users With Bounced Emails?
Problem

Unable to identify users with bounced emails.

Explanation
An email hard bounce occurs when the MoEngage system detects that the recipient's email address does not exist. This tracking is unique for each user based on their user ID.
An email soft bounce is tracked in the MoEngage system when there is a temporary delivery issue. This tracking is unique for each user based on their user ID.
Solution

Perform the following steps:

Go to the desired Email campaign to identify users who have encountered bounced emails.
Copy the campaign ID.

Hover over to the left menu and select Segment > Create segment.
While creating the segment, use the OR condition instead of the AND condition between the Email Bounced and Email Soft Bounced events in the nested filters.



For more information on how to export users and access user profiles, refer to User Data Exports.

Example
As shown in the following screenshot, the first filter searches for users who experienced at least one hard email bounce in the past 30 days.


The second filter searches users who experienced at least one soft bounce in the past 30 days.


In both filters, the Readable Campaign Id (case-insensitive and dependent on a specific scenario) matches the specified value.
As a result, hard or soft bounce emails associated with Readable Campaign Id in the past 30 days will be identified as true."

Why Does the Padding of an HTML Content Block Impact the Entire Template?
Problem 

The padding intended to be applied only to a specific HTML Content block is being added to the entire template instead.


Solution
Use content tags and text elements to add content to the body.
Avoid adding duplicate <html> tags in custom content blocks.
Adding global styles may cause unintended effects. For example, the styles applied also affect the editor's user interface (UI).
If styling is required, use inline Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to ensure it only affects the specific element.

Email Errors

The following table depicts some email errors and their resolution.

Type of Error	Error Code	Description	Resolution
Failed to Deliver	SMTPSenderRefused	The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) refused the sender's address.	

Check with the SMTP provider, or try sending the email again later. If the error is not resolved, raise a support ticket.


Failed to Deliver	SMTPRecipientRefused	

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) refused the recipient's address.

	
Check with the SMTP provider, or try sending the email again later.
Review email IDs and fix the data issue.

Failed to Deliver	Error in Attachments	These errors can occur because of large file sizes, invalid URLs, and the files' unavailability on the added URL.	
Check the attachments added in Step 2 (Content).
Check that the attachment URLs are correct.
Ensure that the file type, number of attachments, and individual and cumulative size are within defined limits.

Failed to Deliver	MaximumLimitExceeded	The credit limit on the SMTP end is exceeded.	

Check with the SMTP and try sending emails again after the credits are updated.

If you use MoEngage as your Email Service Provider (ESP), raise a support ticket.
If you use your own ESP, recharge your credits or contact your ESP's Account Executive.

Failed to Send	Duplicate emails removed	Users were suppressed because of duplicate email IDs in your segment.	
Perform a data clean-up to remove duplicate profiles.
If you need to contact the suppressed customer, request to enable the brand-based deduplication control for you, or use one-time flow campaigns and turn off deduplication.

Failed to Send	BUC	These users were suppressed because a bounce was received, an unsubscribe request was made, or spam complaints were made from them in the past. 	

No action.

Suppressing these users saves negative engagement and protects your domain reputation.


Failed to Send	GCG	These users were suppressed because you configured the Global Control Group. This group helps you compare the performance of the users targeted via campaigns. 	Turn off the Global Control Group exclusion in Step 1 of campaign creation, or remove the Global Control Group from email settings altogether.
Failed to Send	Users removed due to CCG	These users were suppressed because you configured a Campaign Control Group. This group helps you compare the performance of the users targeted via campaigns.	Turn off the Campaign Control Group exclusion in Step 1 of campaign creation.
Failed to Send	FC Removed	

This error occurs when messages are suppressed because the recipient has reached the maximum message limit according to the Frequency Capping (FC).

	Update the FC settings.
Failed to Send	DND Removed	This error occurs when the message is triggered in the Do Not Disturb (DND) hours you configured.	DND applies only to event-triggered campaigns. DND does not apply to one-time, periodic, and business event-triggered campaigns. These types of campaigns are delivered according to the schedule.
Failed to Send	Not sent due to campaign-level minimum delay	This error occurs only for event-triggered campaigns.	
Segment your users differently and schedule campaigns so that they don't overlap.
Remove the minimum delay setting.

Failed to Send	Invalid emails removed	This error occurs when users with invalid emails are suppressed.	Perform data correction or email list validation.
Failed to Send	Encryption/Decryption Failure	This error occurs because of encryption or decryption failure.	

Raise a support ticket.


Failed to Send	IP Warm-Up Removed	This error occurs because your IP warm-up is removed.	Get your warm-up plan updated.
Failed to Send	Invalid API response	This error occurs because of an invalid API response.	 
Failed to Send	Personalisation Failure	This error occurs because of a personalization failure.	Address the missing data."

FAQs - Email
Why Are UTM Parameters Not Tracked When the Embedded URL Redirects to WhatsApp?
Problem

The Email campaign aimed at redirecting users to WhatsApp did not properly track the UTM parameters associated with the campaign.

Explanation
The UTM parameters used in the Email campaign were not tracked correctly on MoEngage because WhatsApp modifies them when the app is opened.
When WhatsApp was opened, it changed or removed the UTM parameters, causing them to be inaccurately tracked on MoEngage for the Email campaign.
Example
The email you received had a redirection URL in which UTM parameters, such as utm_source=MoEngage and utm_medium=EMAIL were missing.
The modified UTM parameters need to resemble utm_source=MoEngagedue.

Why Does Encryption or Decryption Fail in Email Campaigns?
Problem

When sending an Email campaign during testing, the message “Users removed due to Encryption/Decryption failure” is received. Even though encryption is enabled for one attribute, it is not utilized in the campaign.

Solution
This error indicates an issue with how personally identifiable information (PII) is being handled in your campaign. 
This can occur even if you have enabled the PII Encryption feature (Encrypt attribute toggle) for your workspace.
You should pass the email data in an encrypted format to ensure the expected behavior of the PII Encryption feature.
Enabling the PII Encryption feature (Encrypt attribute toggle) will automatically encrypt future email data, preventing this issue.

FAQs - Email
Why Are Users Receiving Campaigns in the Wrong Time Zone?
Problem

The campaign is designed to be sent based on the user's local time zone. However, despite the intended timing, the campaign is being sent to users in the wrong time zone.

Explanation
When a campaign is intended to be sent in a user's time zone, it is typically scheduled to arrive in each user’s local time zone.
If the scheduled time has already passed in the user’s time zone, they may receive the campaign based on the original time zone it was set to (India time zone). 
This variation can result in users receiving the campaign at unexpected times.

FAQs - Email
Why Isn’t Email Content Displaying Correctly in Dark Mode?
Problem

The text color in emails varies depending on the device's display settings. Email text turns black when viewed in dark mode, making it hard to read.

Explanation
The dark background in Email campaigns causes the text color to change in dark mode due to color inversion.
The Gmail app does not render templates correctly in dark mode, leading to color inversion.

You can use a dark mode-friendly email template or incorporate a dark mode-friendly background image.

Email 
FAQs - Email
Why Does the SMTP Data Error Occur in Email Campaigns Sent Through Amazon SES?
Problem

Emails could not be sent through Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) due to a ""SMTPDataError.""

Explanation
This error occurs when the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) connection is not correctly established for sending emails.
Amazon SES imposes sending limits to control the number of emails that can be sent within 24 hours (daily sending quota) and per second.
Suppose the number of messages exceeds the daily maximum for your AWS account. In that case, the API call made from MoEngage to Amazon SES will be rejected, resulting in a ""454 Throttling failures: Daily message quota exceeded error(SMPTDataError)"". 
Solution

To avoid this error during bulk email sending, consider the following points in coordination with the customer or Amazon support team: 

IP usage 
Verify if the customer uses Amazon's dedicated or shared IPs.
Dedicated IP. The request limit is 40 emails per second for each IP. For example, if the customer uses three dedicated IPs, the limit would be 120 emails per second.
Shared IPs. The request limit is 500 emails per second, but the domain reputation might decline if multiple Amazon customers use the same IP.
Throttling settings
Adjust throttling at the global level and campaign-level delivery control. For example, to target 55L users in a one-time Email campaign, it is recommended to use ten dedicated or shared IPs and set throttling to 20000 emails per minute in global and campaign settings.
Daily email request limit
Confirm the total email request limit per day in the customer's Amazon account.

Why Are Images Failing to Load in HTML Email Campaigns?
Problem

Solution

Use single quotation marks within the URL() syntax when adding the image, such as for a background color.

Campaigns and Channels 
Email 
FAQs - Email
Rendering Issues in HTML Templates
Rendering issues in the Android Gmail App
If emails opened in the Android Gmail app render the desktop version of the template rather than the mobile one, this could be because of Gmail's Auto-fit email messages settings. This is, however, not observed in the iOS version of the app.
Auto-fit Email Messages Setting

By default, the Gmail Android app turns on auto-fit email messages. Gmail automatically resizes the messages when this setting is on. This causes the desktop version of the template to be rendered instead of the mobile one. When the setting is unchecked, the mobile preview renders fine.

Turn off this setting to ensure that the mobile preview is used. To turn it off, do the following:

Navigate to the Gmail app.
Tap the menu icon on the top left.
Tap General Settings and uncheck the Auto-fit Email Messages option.
If images are pixelated even though they've been added to the template using the image URL option during Email campaign creation, Auto-fit Email Messages could be causing the issue. MoEngage does not process the images in this option. Turn off the Auto-Fit Email Messages option to ensure that the image renders fine.
Email Clipping in Gmail

The Gmail client can show clipping messages for many reasons, some of which are listed below:

The size of the email template is large. We recommend limiting the size of the template to within 90KB.

Gmail may display the text “Message has been clipped"" without actually clipping the message if the following characters are present in the email:

Non-ASCII characters such as the copyright symbol ©, registered symbol ®, trademark symbol ™

Some HTML entities, such as the ones added for whitespace (nbsp), can cause clipping issues. An HTML entity is of the format &<entity_code>, and the ones listed below may cause email clipping:
&nbsp; - non-breaking space (in a few cases)
&copy; - ©copyright
&reg; - ®registered trademark
&yen; - ¥ yen
&pound; - £ pound
&cent; - ¢ cent
We recommend that you inspect the HTML template code and remove the above-mentioned entities from it to ensure that clipping doesn't happen. For example, if you find trailing &nbsp; at the end or beginning of the template or any &nbsp; used in between the content(or tags) to add a white space like Hello&nbsp;User in the template, remove it. Replace Hello&nbsp;User with Hello User and resend the email.
If you observe clipping in test emails, this might be because they have the same subject line. Gmail often combines, or ""threads,"" emails with the same subject line into a single email in your inbox. If you send several test emails for the same campaign, this may lead to the message becoming so large that Gmail clips it. However, for testing purposes, you can change the subject line or delete the previous test emails in your inbox and then send the test email again.
Blank Preview for Emails
Blank previews could be because Accelerated Mobile Page tags, such as <amp-carousel>, <amp-image>, are being used in the HTML template. AMP tags are not standard HTML tags; AMP is a Google module that works when a script for AMP is added to the HTML.
Script tags are disabled(they get removed) for security reasons by MoEngage. Thus, if AMP tags were added to the email, they would not get rendered, and this will result in a blank preview. For the list of supported HTML tags, refer to the Allowed HTML Tags for Email Templates.
HTML Table with JINJA not working

HTML editors move the JINJA code away from the table to the top if you place the JINJA code between the table content.

Let's say you want to render the names of the products in a table in each row. The below syntax will fail to render correctly in the HTML editor.

HTML
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	<table>

	<% for item in items %>

	<tr><td>{{item.name}}</td></tr>

	<% endfor %>

	</table>

The right way to render a table using the JINJA value is to include a dummy row with JINJA syntax. A dummy row is usually written by using the display property as None.

HTML
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	<tr style=""display:none;"">{% JINJA CODE %}</td></tr>

Using the above code, we can now try to render the table correctly by putting the JINJA code in the dummy row.

HTML
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	<table>

Difference observed in count returned by segmentation and campaign segmentation.
Q: Why there is a difference in count returned while running the query on segmentation and count from campaign segmentation? 

Ans: When we run the campaign filter conditions to segment for the target audience under segmentation, we do not apply extra filters and the query selects users based on the filters specified. However, when the same query is executed during the (email)campaign creation, the following filters are applied in addition to the filters mentioned while creating a campaign:

FAQs - Email
Users are removed due to Personalization Failure
Problem

All the users targeted via an Email campaign were removed due to personalization failure. 

Cause

As the personalization was based on the custom attribute 'First Name', personalization of this campaign failed as it was looking into MoEngage tracked attribute 'First Name' because this attribute did not exist for any of the users in the target segment.

Personalization Code: {{UserAttribute['First Name']|default('MOE_NOT_SEND')}}

As the readable names of both the attributes i.e custom attribute 'First Name' and MoEngage Tracked attribute 'First Name' are the same, the personalization resolves to look into MoEngage tracked attribute and not the custom attribute.

 

Solution

It is not recommended to track custom attributes with same names as the MoEngage tracked attributes as these are reserved keywords. Though we would be able to track this data on user profile, you would face an issue when personalization is done based on these attributes. 

List of MoEngage tracked attributes:

1) Name
2) First Name
3) Last Name
4) Birthday
5) Gender
6) Location
7) Mobile Number (Standard)

Why is the no. of emails sent lower than user segment count?

This is a very common question from marketers sending email campaigns. We provide a clear Delivery Breakdown of emails - right from ""User segment count"" to the no. of emails that were finally sent - at the bottom of the Email Campaign Info page (which you can see by clicking on any campaign on MoEngage Dashboard > Campaigns page).

The various delivery points are as follows:

Segment Count - Total number of users that belong to the segment of the campaign
Users with Email - Total number of users who have an email attribute 
After B/U/C removal - Number of users obtained after removing email addresses that have earlier bounced, unsubscribed, or spam complained.
After Invalid/Duplicate removal - Number of users obtained after removing Invalid emails (missing ""@"" & ""."") and Duplicate Emails (multiple users with the same email address)
After FC Removal - Number of users obtained after removing emails that have crossed Frequency Capping as defined in the FC Settings.
After Personalization Removal - Number of users obtained after removing emails for which the email could not be sent due to personalization failure.
Sent - This is the final count of emails that have been sent.

The exact number of email removals is also mentioned in ""Campaign Delivery Breakdown"", as shown in the snapshot below -

Any emails you send have an impact on your IP and domain reputation. So, we must maintain a clean email sending list - free of emails that bounced, unsubscribed, or complained - which we achieve by not initiating further emails to these email addresses."

info	

Information

In the same way, you can add user attributes.
After you save the sender configuration, you can enable Delivery Tracking for your messages.
Delivery Tracking

Delivery tracking allows you to track the delivery status of the SMS messages sent using custom connectors (service providers). Delivery tracking, when enabled, will show a metric - Delivered, which helps you understand whether messages have been delivered to the user and analyze delivery failures and errors. You can use this information to clean up your delivery list periodically (by removing users for previous deliveries that were unsuccessful). This will help you avoid sending SMS campaigns to users with repeated delivery failures, thus saving costs.

You can add the Delivery Tracking information once you save the connector (service provider) settings for the first time.

Steps to Enable Delivery Tracking

To enable delivery tracking:

Click on the ellipsis icon by hovering over the newly added sender on the SMS settings screen.
Select Edit. The Sender Details screen opens.
Click Next to enable delivery tracking.
The Track sms delivery toggle is turned on. Turn it off to disable delivery tracking.

Copy the SMS delivery tracking URL and paste it into the callback webhook settings of the partner's dashboard. MoEngage generates a unique identifier called custom_connectorID under the SMS delivery tracking URL, as shown below. All senders in a connector will have the same custom_connectorID and delivery tracking URL.

	https://api-0X.moengage.com/sms/dlr/custom/<custom_connectorID>
Map attributes/fields in the delivery response 

You can either map the fields from the delivery response or map the fields manually by choosing the desired option. This mapping helps MoEngage understand the service provider's delivery response. To map the attributes in the delivery response, choose one of the following options:

Map attributes of the delivery response
Map fields manually
If you have not tested your configuration with Send a Test SMS during the previous step, click on Send a test SMS to map the attributes from the delivery response. It may take up to 15 minutes to receive the delivery callback information. Once MoEngage receives this information, it will be shown in the Dashboard.
Field Name	Description


Attribute storing unique ID of the sent response

	

This field uniquely identifies the request. The value of this field should ideally match the value present in the Transaction or msg ID field.


Attribute storing Unique delivery ID field of delivery response	

This field stores the unique identifier of the delivery response. The value in this field should match the value in the sent response. This will help MoEngage identify the delivery response for any given SMS.




Attribute storing delivery status

	

This field contains the delivery status of the sent SMS. This is used to calculate the Delivered metric by MoEngage.




Success values for delivery status

	

The values denote that the SMS has been delivered successfully. We mark a message as delivered if any values mentioned in this field are received as part of the response. If any other value is received in the response, it will be considered a failure by default.




Attribute storing failure reason

	

This field contains the failure reason when an SMS delivery is unsuccessful. The failure reason can be seen in campaign analytics. For more information, refer to Failure Reasons.

Map fields from the delivery response
Map fields manually

To map the fields from the delivery response:

Click Send a Test SMS to send a test SMS and receive a response from your service provider. Once MoEngage receives this information, it will be shown in the Dashboard. You can map the fields from this response. 
The dropdowns are auto-populated with the field names parsed from the delivery response. The following image shows the sample SMS sent and delivery response. The auto-population of the dropdowns from this response for mapping on the Dashboard is also illustrated in the image.

Once the delivery response has been mapped, click Save to save the delivery callback configuration.
info	

Note

The delivery callback is a POST request and accepts a JSON payload.

To optimize system usage, reduce costs, and increase reliability, the delivery callback response payload should not exceed 150 KB in size. MoEngage will send a 413 Bad Request error if the response exceeds this limit. It is recommended to change the payload to a reduced size and send the response again in such a case. MoEngage recommends updating your payload creation code if this error is observed consistently.

Only Admins and Managers can configure Delivery Tracking in MoEngage.

SMS & RCS 
Getting Started with RCS
Introduction to RCS

Rich Communication Services (RCS) is a type of messaging that allows businesses to engage with their users more dynamically and interactively. As a marketer using RCS, you can leverage rich media, such as images, videos, and interactive elements, to create more engaging and visually appealing messages.
With RCS, you can create personalized and targeted campaigns that can be delivered directly to your users’ messaging app. This allows for a more seamless and convenient communication experience for the end user, as they can easily interact with your brand. RCS also offers advanced analytics and reporting capabilities, allowing you to track the performance of your campaigns and make data-driven decisions.
The following image shows an RCS message delivered to a user's messaging app:

Advantages

As a marketer, you can consider RCS as an engagement channel for the following reasons:

Enhanced customer experience: RCS allows for more interactive and engaging conversations. Features such as suggested replies and actions can guide a customer through a transaction or support inquiry smoothly, improving the customer journey significantly.
Rich media capabilities: RCS can include high-resolution images, GIFs, videos, and audio messages, making communication more appealing and informative.
Branding opportunities: RCS messages can be branded with logos, color schemes, and other visual elements to maintain brand consistency and recognition.
Verified sender: RCS includes verified sender status, which gives customers confidence that they are interacting with a legitimate business, increasing trust and security.
Use Cases

Following are some business use cases that can be achieved using RCS:

Retail promotions: Retailers can send rich, interactive promotions that allow users to view images of products and even make purchases directly within the messaging app.
Appointment reminders: Healthcare providers or service-based businesses can send appointment reminders to customers so they can confirm, cancel, or reschedule their appointments directly through the message.
Banking alerts: Financial institutions can send secure account alerts and enable customers to perform simple banking actions like checking balances or fraud alert verification through RCS messaging.
Personalized marketing: Marketers can create personalized campaigns based on customer behavior, interests, and purchase history, delivering tailored recommendations and offers.
Event tickets and check-ins: Customers can receive their event tickets through RCS and even check into events seamlessly.
RCS in MoEngage
Creating RCS campaigns in MoEngage follows the same steps as other channels. Simply select RCS only or RCS with SMS as fallback as the message type when creating RCS campaigns.
MoEngage offers a comprehensive view that aggregates analytics for both RCS and SMS, in addition to providing distinct engagement funnel visualizations for each messaging channel. This functionality enables the optimization of user engagement and amplification of campaign effectiveness. For more information, refer to SMS & RCS Campaign Analytics.
Using the RCS with SMS as fallback message type, you can send RCS campaign with SMS as a fallback. This means if the recipient's device or network does not support RCS, the messages will automatically be sent through traditional SMS, thereby ensuring 100% delivery of these messages. This capability ensures that every segment of the target audience is reached, enhancing the reach and impact of your campaigns.
You can send RCS campaigns using the current user profiles; it is not necessary to create new user profiles specifically for RCS campaigns.
Compliance

The compliance of RCS is the same as that of SMS. For more information, refer to the following articles:

Understanding Explicit vs. Implicit Consent
Messaging Regulations for Europe
Messaging Regulations for Canada
Messaging Regulations for India
Messaging Regulations for US
RCS Partners

MoEngage RCS partners are intermediaries that enable you to procure a number and then send messages. For more information on RCS partners, refer here.

info	

Information

The information requested can differ depending on the carrier.

 

Info	Details
Company name	This is the company name displayed to customers in RCS conversations.
Recipient countries	These are the countries where the messages are intended to be sent.
Company description	This is the company description displayed to customers in RCS conversations. The text of the company description must have a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio relative to white.
Brand color in hexadecimal code	This is the hexadecimal code of your brand color. For example, if your brand color is red, the hexadecimal code for red is #FF0000.
Customer-facing phone number	This is the phone number displayed to customers in RCS conversations.
Customer-facing email address	This is the email address displayed to customers in RCS conversations.
Company website	This is the company web address displayed to customers in RCS conversations.

These mobile phone numbers will be added for testing purposes, and they must include the country code, such as +19999999999. 


Sender billing category	

This refers to the classification used to determine the cost of sending RCS messages. This classification is based on the type of messages sent and their usage.

Conversational: A charge for a conversation that consists of multiple A2P (Application to Person) and P2A (Person to Application) messages within a given period. Select this option if your sender engages in complex user interactions involving messages exchanged in both directions.
Single message: A charge for a single message that includes rich RBM (RCS Business Messaging) content, like a message with a rich card. Select this option if your sender generally sends rich messages and seldom expects to receive replies.
Basic message: A charge for a simple text message of up to 160 characters. Select this option if your sender has upgraded SMS to RBM and seldom expects to receive replies. Generally, the agent is expected to send plain text messages of up to 160 characters. However, the agent is not restricted - it can send richer content if programmed to do so and will be billed accordingly.
Note: The single message and basic message categories never result in conversational billing events. Carriers will charge a basic or single message price for each message based on the content being delivered. This process ensures a clear and straightforward billing system.

Your RCS service provider submits an official registration request to the RCS technology providers (such as MNOs). The registration process typically takes 2–3 business days. The RCS technology provider will notify you when your registration is successful. After that, you can test the connection.

Test the Connection

You can test the connection using the following ways:

Send text messages using your RCS service provider dashboard.
Create an RCS campaign in MoEngage using the allowlisted test mobile phone number.
Verification and Launch

RCS Templates
Overview

RCS helps elevate brand trust and increase business engagement. It allows you to send personalized messages and visual media to customers, improve efficiency, and enable automated notifications. You can send RCS messages using Rich Card or Simple Text message types.

Businesses can communicate with customers interactively through RCS messages created using exciting templates. Templates are pre-designed components that can be easily customized and reused to create RCS messages efficiently. They allow for quick and seamless content creation, saving time and aiding in the development of engaging and visually appealing messages.

For users outside India, template approval is not needed, and sending free-form RCS messages is allowed. Although the use of RCS templates is not mandatory for these users, it is still recommended for the convenience of reusing message content.

info	

Information

The template approval process is required only while sending RCS messages to users in India. These templates are linked with the RCS agents created through your RCS providers.

The following points are to be noted for URL Shortening:

Shortened Links expire in fourteen days and cannot be tracked after expiry. When a customer opens a link beyond its expiry, they see a ""This link is no longer active"" message.
If user and event attributes are used in the shortened links, the attributes' names must abide by the following:
They must not contain spaces.
If the attributes contain links, their values should not contain http:// or https://. These can be added before the attribute to shorten the link.

Data Personalization

User attributes, Product Sets, and Content API can be used for personalization. To insert personalization in the message field, enter @ and the following personalization UI opens as shown below:

Choose Fallback

If the attribute chosen is unavailable for the user or there is some failure in displaying the attribute, you can choose a fallback option as shown above.

Select No Fallback in case there is no alternative to the failed attribute. The personalized attribute will be substituted with empty string in case of personalization failure.
Select Do not send SMS & RCS when you choose not to send the SMS & RCS in case of personalization failure.
Select Replace text in case you choose to replace the failed attribute with a text of your choice. The personalized attribute will be replaced with the Fallback text you provide in case of personalization failure
info	

Note

Ensure that custom attributes do not have the same names as MoEngage's standard attributes. If a custom attribute and a standard attribute having the same name are used for personalization, it could result in incorrect personalization.

Personalization for Business Event-Triggered Campaigns

In business event-triggered SMS & RCS campaigns, you can use the attribute of the business event that is mapped to the campaign to personalize the campaign. To do so:

Type @ in the content creation step to invoke the personalization editor.
The attributes of the Business Event mapped to the campaign are shown under the Business Event Attribute as shown below:



Choose the attribute to be used for personalization and customize the message.

Personalization with business events can be a huge differentiator in terms of effort and automation, as you can use one template and send multiple campaigns with it. For example, if you have to communicate information about three new web series that are being launched - you can do so with the same campaign. You can use the event attributes to personalize the message for each series by using the series name, image, cast, and air date to send the communication to your dynamic segment (that matches the user interest (say, preferred genre) to that of the genre of the series).

Personalize using Content Blocks

Content Blocks are reusable content that can be used across various campaigns. These are particularly useful for headers, footers, signature blocks, terms and conditions, and so on.

To personalize using content block, type @ in the message section and navigate to the Content blocks tab in the personalization screen that pops up.

Click Done to add the chosen Content Block and it gets added to the message as shown below.
Turning on the Insert only the content of the content block toggle disconnects the content from the existing content block, and any future updates to the content block will not be reflected in the campaign.
SMS
RCS
Personalize Using Auxiliary Data

You can personalize your SMS & RCS content using auxiliary data by selecting the auxiliary data attributes in the personalization editor.

To personalize content using Auxiliary Data attributes:

Enter @ in the Message field to invoke the personalization editor.
Select the Aux Data tab.
In the Aux data drop-down list, select the Auxiliary Data file whose attribute you wish to use for personalization.
In the Lookup value drop-down list, select the primary key specified for the Auxiliary Data during import. This will identify the user for whom the Auxiliary Data is being fetched.
In the Attribute drop-down list, specify the attribute to be personalized using Auxiliary Data.
Click Done. The Auxiliary Data JINJA will get added to the field or the editor.


For more information, refer to Personalize Campaign Content Using Auxiliary Data.

Personalize Using Content APIs

SMS Campaigns can be personalized using Content APIs to deliver relevant and timely information to the customers. 

Add Content APIs

Content APIs can be added to the MoEngage dashboard. Using the following navigation to access Content API: Settings > APIs > Content API and click Add to add the Content API. Click here for more information.

Create a Personalized Campaign using Content API
Type @ in the content creation step to invoke the personalization editor.

Campaign Performance Timeline View

This section provides a clear overview of how messages progress through different stages such as Attempted, Sent, Failed, Delivered, Clicked, and Read over time. This helps track engagement, spot delivery issues, and improve messaging. Filters are available to focus on relevant messages. The timeline chart makes it easy to see trends and performance changes at a glance. You can switch between a graph view for trends and a tabular view for detailed metrics.

The Read metric is applicable only to the RCS message type.

Locale/Variation Performance

Now that you have understood consolidated and individual  metrics for SMS or RCS, let’s examine performance across different locales and variations to view how the overall effectiveness is impacted. You can also check the uplift percentage in the tabular view of locale and variation performance. For more information, refer to Uplift in Campaigns.

Use the metrics list and filters to customize comparisons:

Group by locale: View performance by locale with variations grouped under each locale. You can hover over the bar graph to see how each variation performed.

Group by variation: View performance by variation with locales grouped under each variation. You can hover over the bar graph to see how each locale performed within a variation.

info	

Information

Delivery metrics are only available in the “All Locales” view and are not available while viewing analytics for individual locales.

Campaign Delivery Stats

When reviewing campaign performance, it is essential to understand the user journey and identify potential drop-off points. The funnel stages include:


Funnel Stage	What it represents
Users with valid mobile numbers	Represents the total number of users who have a valid mobile number.
Users After FC Removal	Represents the number of users who have a valid mobile number and do not breach Frequency Capping (FC) criteria.
Duplicate Mobile numbers removed	Represents the number of users who have met the above funnels after the removal of duplicate mobile numbers.
Sent	Represents the number of users for whom the message was sent successfully to the SMS and RCS Provider. 
Delivered	Represents the number of users for whom the SMS and RCS Provider has sent information about having received a delivery confirmation receipt from the mobile network operator.
Click Performance

Now, let’s take a closer look at how users are interacting with your RCS messages. The following metrics are applicable only to RCS messages:


Total clicks: The total number of times users clicked on RCS messages.
Unique clicks: The number of individual users who clicked on unique links at least once.
Event details
Suggestion clicks: This metric shows how often users engage with quick replies, links, or URLs in RCS messages.
URL clicks: This metric measures how many times users click a URL within an RCS message.

For more information on how to use these events to create an event-triggered campaign, refer to Create an Event-Triggered Campaign.

Conversion Goal Performance

This section appears when multiple conversion goals are set for a campaign. It allows you to compare the performance of the goals set by the marketer for the campaign.

Total conversions: Displays all goal events, meaning if a user completes the same goal multiple times, each instance is counted.
Unique conversions: Counts only one conversion per goal for each user in each campaign.
For example, if a campaign has two conversion goals, Sign up and Purchase, and a user signs up twice and makes two purchases, only one Sign up and one Purchase will be counted as unique conversions for that campaign.

The uplift percentage is displayed in the tabular view of Conversion goals performance. For more information, refer to Uplift in Campaigns.


Attribution Details

Before diving into campaign-specific insights, you can use the following global filters that apply across all sections in the Analytics tab:


Date range: You can select the date range to view the performance stats.
Attribution type: You can select the attribution type (Click through, In-session, and View through) to view the analytics information for the specified attribution type. 

info	

Information




Attribution types are only applicable when you have set a conversion goal for your campaign.


The following are the types of attribution:
Click through conversion: When a user clicks your message and converts, it is attributed to click through conversion.
View through conversion: When a user sees your message and doesn't click it but converts afterward, it is attributed to view through conversion.
In-session conversion: When a user converts within 30 minutes of clicking on the message, it is attributed to in-session conversion.
For example, consider the case where three customers, namely Users A, B, and C, received your message from campaign C1.
User A clicked the message and did the conversion event within 30 minutes (we assume it to be the same session) of clicking.
User B clicked the message and did the conversion event 2-3 hours after clicking.
User C saw your message, later launched the app directly, and made the conversion.

When you attribute this conversion to campaign C1, User A is direct attribution, while User B and C are indirect attributions.

Attribution Type	Description	Example
View through	

View through attribution is the total number of conversion goals executed by users who received your communication within the configured attribution window from the time they received the campaign. This appears as a default filter in your Campaign Performance.

	

If the user received your message at 7 AM and your attribution window was 12 hours, the user conversion events till 7 PM will be attributed to this campaign using View through attribution.


Click through	

Click through attribution is click-based tracking. Click through attribution is the number of conversion goals executed by users who clicked the notification within the configured attribution window from the time of click.

	

If the user receives your message at 7 AM, clicks it at 8 AM, and your attribution window is 12 hours, the user conversion events until 8 PM are attributed to this campaign in Click through attribution.


In-session	

The in-session attribution is based on In-session tracking. The in-session attribution is the number of conversion goals executed by users within 30 minutes after clicking your communication.

	

If the user receives your message at 7 AM, clicks it at 8 AM, and your attribution window is 12 hours, the user conversion events until 8:30 AM (within 30 minutes of starting the session) will be attributed to this campaign in In-session attribution.

Attribution window: The attribution window is the duration calculated from the time a user receives a campaign with specific conversion goals. For example, two campaigns with a conversion goal of a purchase are created: Campaign C1 at time H hours and Campaign C2 at H+12 hours. The customer achieves the conversion goal for purchase with the campaigns C1 and C2 at time H+15 hours. The conversion of customers is attributed both to C1 and C2. 

The maximum attribution window is 7 days for SMS and RCS campaigns in MoEngage. When you send more than one campaign with a difference of less than 7 days, then set the attribution window:

Lesser than 7 days.
With the duration difference in sending the campaigns.

For example, if you are sending campaigns with a difference of 12 hours, set the attribution window to 12 hours.

Error Breakdown

Knowing why messages fail to reach users is key to improving engagement. This section details the number of campaign delivery failures and their reasons. The failures are segregated into two parts:

Failed to send: When MoEngage does not send messages to your SMS and RCS provider due to issues like personalization errors or problems at the SMS or RCS provider's end. 
Failed to deliver: When your SMS and RCS provider does not deliver messages due to issues with the SMS and RCS provider, including delivery receipt failures or errors in transit while MoEngage awaits confirmation from the provider.

For more information on SMS and RCS errors, refer to Common Errors in SMS and RCS campaigns.


Best Time for Sending (BTS)

BTS campaigns use MoEngage's AI SHERPA to analyze past user engagement to determine the best time to send campaigns, ensuring messages reach users when they are most likely to engage. Here's how it works:

BTS: AI-driven delivery that personalizes send times for maximum engagement
Default time: The campaign is sent at a fixed, predefined time if BTS is not applied.
App's most active time: Messages are scheduled when users are generally the most active on the app.

For more information, refer to Best time to send.

Time Zone Based Delivery

This section is the final step in analyzing your campaigns. It ensures that campaigns reach users at the right time, no matter where they are. Instead of sending messages at a single global time, this feature adjusts delivery based on each user’s local time zone. This helps maintain relevance, prevent delays, and increase engagement by ensuring users receive messages when they are most likely to interact. If a time zone match isn't possible, the system uses a default send time to maintain consistency. 
For more information, refer to Send campaign in recipient's time zone."

Compliance and Deliverability
Understanding Explicit vs. Implicit Consent
Introduction

In this article we will talk about the different types of consent (explicit vs. implicit) in MoEngage and who you can or cannot send SMS & RCS messages. Being able to send SMS & RCS messages to a subscriber basically boils down to having the proper consent.

There are two types of consent:

Explicit (also sometimes referred to as express consent)
Implicit (also sometimes referred to as implied or inferred consent)
info	

Note

This information is not legal advice. MoEngage recommends that you consult with your legal counsel to make sure that you comply with applicable laws in connection with your marketing activities.

Explicit consent

Explicit consent occurs when someone directly tells you that they want to receive marketing messages from your brand. You can get express consent when they:

Sign up through a form
Give you their information on an in-person mailing list (in your store or at a booth)
Tell you verbally that they want to get marketing messages from you and provide you with their contact information
Opt in to a push notifications through a permission prompt when opening the app

With explicit consent, the subscriber must knowingly consent to receive marketing messages.

Pros and cons of explicit consent
Pros

Provides higher-quality subscribers

Is always allowed

Doesn’t expire

Cons
May lead to fewer subscribers

When you have express consent, you are free to send that subscriber marketing messages until they opt out — it doesn’t expire. One con with express consent is that fewer people will explicitly opt in than implicitly opt in. Thus, list growth might be slower, but those who do subscribe will be higher-quality contacts than those who haven’t knowingly or explicitly consented.

Implicit consent

Implicit consent is when someone gives you their contact information (e.g., email address, phone number, etc.) but does not explicitly say they want to receive marketing messages from your brand. A common example of implicit consent is when a customer makes a purchase and provides their email at checkout. They have not explicitly said they want to receive marketing messages from the brand, but it can be inferred that they have an interest in relevant content. In this case, you have their information, but they haven’t agreed to receive marketing communications.

Examples of implied consent include:

Signing up for gated content or resources (e.g., a forum, article, Wi-Fi network, etc.)
Inputting contact information during checkout (if they haven’t checked a box or otherwise agreed to receive marketing messages)
Giving you a business card
Buying or leasing a service, good, or product from you
Agreeing to a contract (written or electronic) with you
Partaking in a gaming or investment opportunity with you
Making a donation to you (if you are a registered charity or political organization)
Volunteering for you (if you are a registered charity or political organization)
Being a member of your organization’s club, association, or non-profit volunteer group

The laws around implied consent vary by country; typically when implied consent is allowed, it is either restricted to a certain time frame (e.g., it’s only good for two years) or in specific circumstances.

Pros and cons of implicit consent
Pros

Provides a greater number of subscribers

Cons

Leads to low-quality subscribers and deliverability issues

Usually expires after a certain amount of time

Is banned or heavily restricted in certain jurisdictions

A pro of implied consent is that you can gather a lot more contacts with implied consent than express consent. However, since these contacts haven’t actually agreed to receiving marketing messages from your brand, they are more likely to opt out or mark you as spam, leading to deliverability issues. 

Implied consent is not allowed in certain jurisdictions, and in others, it’s only allowed under special circumstances. Thus, by relying on implied consent, you risk running into compliance issues, depending on where your recipients are located.

Best practices for consent

There are a few best practices for consent you should follow:

Get express consent/avoid sending to those with implied consent
Make it clear what recipients are opting into
Record the method of consent collection (i.e., when, where, and how someone gave express consent)

We recommend getting express consent whenever possible. If you collect implied consent and it’s allowed in a jurisdiction you send to, use a separate list for those with implied consent. Furthermore, retarget these contacts to try to obtain their express consent, such as targeting them via social media or signup units."

Messaging Regulations for Europe
Overview

In this article, you will learn about best practices for SMS & RCS marketing in the European Union (EU).

The following regulations apply to SMS & RCS marketing in Europe:

EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
EU ePrivacy Regulations

Please note, certain countries may have country specific laws and regulations that apply to SMS & RCS marketing and are not included in this guidance.

info	

Note

This information is intended solely for educational and informational purposes and should not be construed as legal advice. The content provided is general in nature and may not reflect the most up-to-date information. MoEngage strongly advises consulting with a qualified legal counsel to ensure your compliance with applicable laws and regulations in connection with your use of our services.

SMS & RCS Compliance in the EU

There are a number of compliance dos and don’ts for SMS & RCS marketing in the EU:

Do:

Obtain explicit consent from recipients before messaging them.
Allow recipients to easily opt out.
Only send during daytime hours (i.e., not during quiet hours).
SMS & RCS should support both HELP and STOP keywords, as well as similar keywords, in the recipient’s local language.
Clearly identify your brand or organization in your messages.

Do not:

Send to recipients on do-not-call or do-not-disturb registries.
Include prohibited content in your messages.

The following sections explain these practices in more detail.

Obtain explicit consent

When collecting consent in the EU, you must provide a clear and detailed explanation of how you plan to use the subscriber’s information. Under GDPR, consent needs to be “freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.”

info	

Note

Double opt-in, where available, is always recommended as a best practice. This is particularly the case in Germany and some other E.U. countries, such as Austria and Switzerland, where double opt-in is the preferred way of demonstrating that consent has been properly and lawfully obtained. Customers on a paid plan should, therefore, consider using Smart Opt-in as a default for collecting SMS consent.

When asking for consent:

Make it easy for recipients to opt out (e.g., via an opt-out keyword or unsubscribe link).
Provide links to your privacy policy and terms of service.
Be clear about what information you are collecting and how you are going to use it.
Be clear about what subscribers are subscribing to.
Ask for consent for each specific purpose (e.g., if you collect consent for both SMS and email, use separate fields for each channel so that someone has the option to subscribe to one and not the other).
Make sure the subscriber has to take an active step (e.g., checking an unchecked box) to relay their consent.
Make sure consent is not conditional on receiving a good or service.
Do not accept consent from children under 16 unless you have permission from the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
Keep accurate records of when, where, how, and for what purpose a subscriber gave you their consent.

Under GDPR, there are other bases (like “legitimate interest”) that may be relied on instead of explicit consent. 

Only send during daytime hours

In most countries in the EU, SMS & RCS messages should not be sent too late or too early in the day. In general, send in your recipient’s local time and avoid sending:

Before 9 a.m.
After 8 p.m.
info	

Note

In some cases, you may be able to legally send at 8 a.m. or up to 9 or 10 p.m., however, SMS & RCS engagement tends to be lower at these times.

All Sundays

Public holidays

* For the US, most of the country is covered by the TCPA, which allows sending from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. However, several states (such as Florida) have enacted mini-TCPAs for their state and limit sending to between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.

** Quiet hours in France are enforced by wireless carriers. This means that you may legally be allowed to send Sundays, but your messages won’t be delivered. The carriers may also decide to filter your other messages if you continue to send outside of the quiet hours.

Identify your brand/organization

As a best practice, each text message you send to recipients in the EU should identify you as the sender. Many companies do this by either:

Customizing their sender ID (when using branded sender IDs)
Including their organization name at the start of each message (when using long or short codes)
Do not include prohibited content

Wireless carriers may refuse to deliver SMS & RCS messages that reference or otherwise contain content relating to certain topics, including:

Illegal substances
SHAFT
Sex
Hate
Alcohol
Firearms (including fireworks)
Tobacco (including CBD)
Gambling
Debt collection/forgiveness
High-risk financial services (e.g., cryptocurrency)
Multi-level marketing

While not all of these topics are prohibited in every country, carriers periodically reassess what content they will allow and don't always make this information public in a timely or formal manner. It's best to avoid content related to these topics in any country you're sending to.

Anything related to these prohibited topics in either your messages or website may result in those messages getting filtered by the carrier or the carrier completely blocking the sending number.

Allow people to opt out easily

Each text message you send to recipients in the EU must also include an opt-out mechanism. Many companies do this by:

When using branded sender IDs: including an unsubscribe link in their messages.
When using long or short codes: adding an opt-out keyword at the end of the text messages.

When creating an SMS & RCS message in the MoEngage message editor, you can automatically add an opt-out keyword to your messages if Keyword Management is enabled for you. Note that this option is turned off by default.

Support HELP and STOP keywords

SMS & RCS messages should support both HELP and STOP keyword commands, as well as similar keywords in the recipient’s local language.

In MoEngage, all the following keywords are supported automatically:

HELP and INFO
STOP and CANCEL
START and UNSTOP
Do not contact users on do-not-call or do-not-disturb registries

As a guideline, don’t contact anyone on do-not-call or do-not-disturb registries. Many EU countries have their own registries"

Messaging Regulations for Canada
Overview

Learn about the Canadian law that governs commercial electronic messages (such as email, SMS, and RCS), which is the Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL).

When sending marketing messages, it’s important that you know about this law if you have Canadian recipients.

info	

Note

This information is not legal advice. MoEngage recommends that you consult with your legal counsel to make sure that you comply with CASL and all other applicable laws in connection with your marketing activities.

About CASL

CASL is a Canadian federal law that is designed to protect consumers from spam, electronic threats, and other misuses of digital technology.

CASL covers all commercial electronic messages (CEMs), which are messages that:

Are in an electronic format (e.g., emails, SMS/MMS/RCS messages, social media messages, and instant messages)
Are sent to an electronic address (e.g., an email account, a telephone account, an instant messaging account, and any other similar account)
Encourage participation in a commercial activity (e.g., offers to purchase or sell products, goods, and services or promoting products, goods, services, people, or businesses).

The 3 main CASL requirements that you need to comply with when sending CEMs are:

Obtain consent
Provide identification information
Provide a way to unsubscribe/opt out of messaging

Fines for violating CASL can be up to $1 million per violation for individuals and up to $10 million per violation for businesses. Both individuals and businesses (including their directors, officers, and other agents) can be liable for violations of CASL.

Under CASL, you must obtain proper consent from recipients of CEMs. In the next section, we go over what it means to have this consent.

Consent: Explicit vs. Implicit

There are 2 types of consent under CASL:

Explicit (also known as express)
Implicit (also known as implied)

CASL primarily relies on explicit consent, meaning that anyone you message must opt into that channel, with a few exceptions. You must also keep a record of all consents obtained under CASL (i.e., when and how consent was obtained).

Explicit Consent

Explicit consent means someone has told you explicitly that it’s okay to send them a message. They can do so either verbally, in writing, or by subscribing via a form, but must take a positive action to indicate their consent. If you request consent via a checkbox, the box must be unchecked by default.

Requests for consent must include:

A clear and concise explanation of why you are obtaining consent
A description of the types of messages you’ll be sending
Your name (or business name) and contact information (valid mailing address and either anemail address, phone number, or web address)

A statement that the recipient can withdraw their consent at any time
When someone gives consent for one type of CEM, this does not mean you can message them via another channel. For instance, if someone agrees to receive emails from your brand, this does not count as agreeing to receive SMS & RCS, social media, or instant messages.

Explicit consent does not expire, but recipients can withdraw their consent at any time.

Some types of CEMs (such as SMS & RCS) always require explicit consent. However, others (such as email) allow implicit consent in certain conditions. 

Implicit Consent

Implicit consent is only allowed in certain situations under CASL.

The first and most notable situation is when you have an existing business relationship with the recipient. Examples of this are if they purchased a product, good, or service from you; accepted a business deal or investment with you; or entered into a written contract with you — all within the past two years — or if they inquired about a product, good, or service from you in the past six months.

A similar case is when someone has an existing non-business relationship with the recipient. For example, they will have implicit consent if they donated or volunteered with your registered charity or political organization within the past two years.

Another scenario where implicit consent may apply is if a person makes their email address publicly available by publishing it on a website, and does not include a statement that they do not want to receive CEMs at that address.

Unlike explicit consent, implicit consent can expire. When there is a time period associated with implicit consent, if the recipient has not “renewed” their implicit consent during that time period (e.g., by purchasing from you again), the implicit consent expires and you are no longer allowed to send CEMs to that recipient.

Because of the complexity involved with implicit consent, we recommend that you obtain explicit consent from all recipients you plan to send CEMs to. Explicit consent is required in order to send SMS, RCS and MMS messages using MoEngage SMS & RCS.

Additional Requirements Under CASL

In addition to obtaining consent, CASL requires the following information to be included within every message:

Your business name, if different from your name (if not, identify your name) and the name of anyone else on whose behalf you are sending the message.
Contact information, which must include:
A valid mailing address (which must be valid for at least 60 days after your message was sent)
At least one of the following
Email address
Web address
Phone number to reach an agent or voice messaging system
An unsubscribe mechanism (e.g., an unsubscribe link, “text STOP to opt out,” etc.)

You must include this information, or a way to quickly get this information, in every CEM. In emails, the typical approach is to add these details to the footer. For SMS, RCS and MMS messages (and other CEMs where it’s not practicable to include this info in the body of the message), the typical method is adding “Info:” followed by a link to a webpage that contains this information to the end of each CEM.

Best Practices

While not explicitly required by CASL, there are a few best practices you can follow when sending CEMs:

Include at least one link to your website
Send between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. in the recipients’ local time (for SMS, RCS and direct messages); use Do Not Disturb for flows to automatically prevent sending SMS & RCS messages outside of these times
Do not use spammy phrases in your messages or email subject lines; e.g., “free money”
Provide value, every CEM should be helpful to the recipient; if not, subscribers will likely opt out
Avoid sending a lot of emojis and using acronyms unless you know your audience understands or responds positively to them
Do not overload recipients with too many messages; for instance, use Frequency Capping to limit how often someone can receive messages via a certain channel
CASL Exemptions

Certain types of CEMs are exempt from CASL and not subject to the requirements described above. The following types of CEMs are exempt from CASL:

Messages sent in response to a recipient’s complaint, question, or request, or messages that are otherwise solicited by the recipient (i.e., the “email reply” exemption)
Sending certain transactional messages
Providing information about a warranty, a recall, safety, or security for a product or service that the recipient bought
Notifying or giving factual information about an account; membership; purchase, subscription; or other ongoing relationship, including delivery of product updates or upgrades

Important

The DLT regulations are applicable only for sending SMS & RCS messages to Indian mobile numbers.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has released The Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation (TCCCPR) 2018 with the aim of regulating Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC) and making the unorganized SMS process more transparent. TRAI has formulated new guidelines to prevent SMS scams and bring safety and convenience to end users. This system will be driven by the DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology), a blockchain-based technology explained below.

DLT Ecosystem for bulk SMS & RCS

Under the DLT technology, the companies that want to send transactional or promotional messages to their end-users will now have to register themselves with telecom operators. These companies must be accountable to telecom operators, who will be directly accountable to TRAI.

The DLT ecosystem comprises five different entities:

Entity

	

 Roles and responsibilities


Principal Entity (PE)	

Businesses like you who want to send SMS & RCS messages to their customers. 

As per the TRAI guidelines, every PE has to be registered with the telecom operators in the DLT platform.


End-user	

The end user is the mobile subscriber who will receive the SMS & RCS messages.

They have the right to provide consent to receive promotional SMS & RCS messages from any businesses, register complaints, and opt out of unwanted/spam messages.


Service Provider or Telemarketer	

You will need service providers to send Bulk SMS & RCS messages to your end users. All the service providers have to be registered on the DLT platform so they can send SMS & RCS on behalf of the PE. 

MoEngage has direct integration with Gupshup and Kaleyra and helps you meet DLT compliance via these providers.


Telecom Operators	They are the access providers (Vodafone, Airtel, Idea, BSNL, etc) who are in direct connection with TRAI and aid with the regulation process.
Regulator (TRAI)	

TRAI will establish regulatory compliance by auditing and governing the operations to safeguard customers’ preferences and prevent fraudulent practices.

On the DLT platform, you will get the option to register as a Telemarketer or Enterprise. Any business that deals with customers and communicates with them through SMS & RCS would most probably be categorized as a telemarketer.

There are 2 types of Telemarketers:

Telemarketer Aggregator: They don’t have a direct connection with the telecom operator. Could be an individual or a company.
Telemarketer Delivery: They have a direct connection with telecom operators. Collect SMS & RCS/voice traffic from enterprises. 

Enterprises are businesses that deal with products or services that would like to connect with leads through SMS & RCS to increase their sales.

DLT Registration

You would need to register to the DLT platform via the individual operators.

The direct link to the DLT portal for different operators is given below. You need to register with an operator.

Airtel  
Vodafone 
Reliance Jio
Videocon (PingConnect)
Tata
BSNL

As part of the process, you will be required to submit details such as Business Identity (PAN), Business Address Proof (GST/TAN), and a Letter of Authorization on the network portal (start with any operator portal).

Post submission, you will receive the Unique Entity ID that you can later use to register on the other portals. This Unique Entity ID can then be used to register with all other operators.

Once you have the unique entity ID, add the headers and templates for promotional and transactional messages. Also, add the registered headers and templates on other operator portals.

warning	

Critical

As per the regulations, it is mandatory to register HEADER (Sender ID) and TEMPLATES with All operators to avoid rejections from the cross-operator. For more information, refer to DLT Impact on SMS."

Compliance and Deliverability
Messaging Regulations for US
Overview

In this article we will learn about the compliance laws governing the SMS & RCS channel. When getting started with SMS & RCS marketing, it's important to have a grasp on the corresponding legislation. As with email, to avoid spam violations, it’s important to understand what spam is, the laws that regulate telemarketing spam (TCPA), and the organizations that protect consumers from spam (CTIA). Please note that MoEngage cannot provide legal advice regarding US SMS & RCS compliance laws, and if you have questions about any of the points outlined in this guide, we recommend contacting legal counsel.

Text messaging laws vary by country. The laws covered in this guide are specifically around US laws. If your business is located in another country, or you have customers in other countries, follow all SMS & RCS laws and legal requirements in the areas where you do business.

Text spam

Like spam emails, spam texts are any unwanted messages sent from an individual or company, often containing irrelevant, inappropriate, or untimely content. They are often sent to a large number of recipients, but this isn't a necessary qualification — any unwanted message can be classified as spam. In addition to generally being a bad practice, it is also illegal to send unsolicited text messages to people without their consent, and the fines can be heavy. This is why obtaining consent is so important.

The penalties for violating the TCPA can be severe. Fines range anywhere from $500 per violation to $1,500 per willful violation (meaning you knew what you were doing was wrong, but did it anyway). Some settlements have reached into the tens of millions of dollars. These violations can add up fast, which is why having concrete processes in place is of paramount importance. If you think of how many people you have on your list, imagine if you texted all of them without express consent at $500 per person. You should always have an attorney review your entire texting policy and process. This will help ensure you remain in compliance.

SMS & RCS Compliance Guidelines

While we recommend that you consult an attorney to ensure that your text messaging program and policies comply with US SMS & RCS laws and carrier guidelines, there are some general guidelines and best practices you can follow:

Get express consent

Always obtain express consent before texting anybody. Even if they have opted into your email list and you have their phone number from a signup form, this does not mean they consent to receive text messages from you. The consent you obtain must contain explicit language indicating that the individual agrees to receive recurring marketing messages at the mobile phone number they provided you, that your messages may involve the use of an automatic telephone dialing system or ""autodialer,"" and that consent is not a condition of any purchase.

Consent must be obtained in writing via a physically signed agreement, a digitally signed agreement, or most commonly, an SMS & RCS opt-in. An opt-in text message is one in which the user provides you with their number with the understanding that they will receive text messages. During this process, you then send them a text message to confirm that their number is real and that they consent to receive future text messages from your business.

A single consent cannot be provided to multiple brands or organizations. Customers must provide consent to receive messages from your company explicitly. Lead generation, affiliate related, or purchased lists are not valid SMS & RCS consent.

Give recipients a way to opt out

It's important to provide an automated way for recipients to opt out at any time. This can be as simple as replying ""stop"" to a text message that you sent them. Think of this as a way to ""unsubscribe"" from text marketing. Opt-out instructions should be provided at regular intervals and at least once per month. Certain carriers like T-Mobile also recommend providing explicit opt out instructions in every fifth message.

Explain what someone is opting into

You must be clear about what subscribers opting into. If they’re opting in to receive shipping confirmations, don’t send them marketing collateral about unrelated products they haven’t purchased.

Comply with time of day restrictions

The TCPA prohibits any telephone solicitation (including text messages) anytime before 8 am and after 9 pm in the recipient's time zone (known as ""quiet hours""), but certain states have more restrictive rules.

To be safe, you should only send texts during normal hours (9 am to 8 pm in the recipient's time zone). If you have customers in different time zones, you’ll need to take multiple time zones into consideration. A “Good Morning, [name]” text sent at 11 am Pacific Time won’t make sense to somebody reading it on the east coast at 2 pm.

You can configure MoEngage Do Not Disturb feature to prevent SMS & RCS flows from sending before 11 am and after 8 pm (using Eastern Time in the US).

Other best practices
Provide value — if your text messages aren’t helpful, your subscribers will probably opt-out. Provide something of value, whether it’s a discount code, a link to helpful content, or notifications relevant to something they’ve purchased.
Avoid acronyms and shorthand because not everyone will be savvy to common acronyms that you may use in text conversations (e.g., ""lol"" or ""lmk"").
Cap your frequency. Use Frequency Capping to prevent recipients from receiving too many text messages within a short timeframe. If you’re sending individuals more than one or two texts per day, or four-five a week, you’re likely sending too many and risk that person opting out.
Measure your results. Every text campaign or automation should be continuously measured to ensure you’re not losing subscribers and that they’re taking the desired action. While you can’t measure open rates like you can with email, aim for your click rates (for text messages that have links) to be at or above the average of 45%.
SMS & RCS compliance FAQs
What is TCPA?

TCPA stands for the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The telemarketing law dates back to 1991 and covers the use of automated telephone communications, including phone calls, voicemails, fax machines, and text messages. Text messages are considered transactions similar to phone calls, which is why they are covered under the TCPA. Under TCPA, sending spam text messages is illegal and can result in fines starting at $500 per infringement, and reaching as high as $1,500.

TCPA defines spam text messages as any “unsolicited advertisement” that communicates the commercial availability of a product, good, or service to a person without their prior express approval or permission, whether in writing or otherwise. Because of this, it's recommended that you use double opt-in to confirm recipients' subscriptions to SMS & RCS. Double opt-in text messages help:

Confirm the phone number provided by the recipient is legitimate and correct.
Capture an electronic record of the recipient’s consent.
Provide a way for the person to opt-out.
What is CTIA?

CTIA is the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. The CTIA is a trade organization run by wireless companies such as AT&T, Verizon, and many more. It is not a law or government-run organization like the FCC, and has no legal authority. You cannot be sued for not following CTIA guidelines; however, there can be other ramifications for not following their rules. If found to be in violation of these rules, the CTIA will report you to the mobile carriers, who may shut down or suspend your access to their customers until you resolve the issue.

In addition, the CTIA established the common short code system, which is how the majority of businesses send marketing text messages to their customers and prospects. The CTIA also says any messages that contain words relating to sex, hate, alcohol, firearms, or tobacco (SHAFT) should not be delivered.

What is the best way to acquire proper consent?

Firstly, it's important to understand that you cannot and should not text anybody without their express permission to receive text messages from you. So, if you have their phone number because they were required to submit it at checkout, but do not have their explicit consent to receive messages from you, then you should NOT send them text messages.

Once you have their permission, you should always send a message confirming their opt-in status, and provide an explanation for how they can opt-out. This can be as simple as telling them to reply “STOP” if they ever choose to stop receiving texts from you.

Here are four steps you can follow to ensure you are always collecting phone numbers and communicating via SMS & RCS in a compliant manner.

Consent must be obtained in writing via a physically signed agreement, a digitally signed agreement, or most commonly, an SMS & RCS opt-in. An opt-in text message is one in which the user provides you with their number with the understanding that they will receive text messages. During this process, you then send them a text message to confirm that their number is real and that they consent to receive future text messages from your business.
The consent you obtain must contain explicit language indicating that the individual agrees to receive recurring marketing messages at the mobile phone number they provided you, that your messages may involve the use of an automatic telephone dialing system or ""autodialer,"" and that consent is not a condition of any purchase.
Disclose the type of content they will receive and the frequency of messages.
In subsequent text messages, it is considered a best practice to mention your company by name, the frequency of messages, possible carrier costs and fees, and an option for them to request help or opt-out of future texts.
If my customers already consent to receive email, can I skip this?

No. If somebody is on your email list, it does not necessarily mean you have consent to send them text messages as well, even if they provide their phone number when they subscribe to your emails. Vice versa, if somebody consents to receive text messages from you, it does not necessarily imply email consent. Your email list and text list consent are treated separately by MoEngage.

What if my customers opt-out of future SMS & RCS text messages? How long do I have to honor opt-out requests?

It’s important to note that the most common way for people to remove consent is to reply “STOP” to any text message you send. However, you should be aware that some people may request to remove consent via other avenues, such as by emailing or calling your customer support team, or even contacting you via social media channels.

You should have processes in place to remove these people from your text messaging lists as quickly as possible, ideally within 10 days. In MoEngage, if someone texts ""STOP,"" they will automatically be suppressed in your account, meaning they will no longer be eligible to receive texts. Unless somebody specifically opts back in, you cannot send them text messages at all in the future."

DLT impact on SMS

To be compliant with DLT regulations, you will have to make a few changes to make in your SMS settings. This will ensure no interruptions in your current/future SMS campaigns. For more information, refer to the SMS DLT regulations and registration process.

info	

Information

Since DLT regulations are applicable only in India, these changes are applicable only if you are sending SMS to Indian mobile numbers.
The regulatory process requires scrubbing the Entity IDs, Sender IDs, and Template IDs with all the operators.
Ensure that all the content templates are uploaded to the operator DLT portal.

In this article, we will list the areas impacted due to DLT regulation and what you need to do about them.

Update DLT-specific details with your SMS provider

As per the DLT platform scrubbing requirements, operators will accept and deliver messages only if they receive the following information in every message submission:

Principal Entity ID
Sender ID
Template ID

We've listed the instruction to be followed for the SMS providers Gupshup and Kaleyra below:

SMS Gupshup
Kaleyra (Solution Infini)
Login to the Gupshup portal using your Account login details and OTP.
Go to the DLT Template module. There are two tabs: Single Template and Upload Template List.
In the Single Template section, list the following and click SUBMIT.
Template Name
Template Id (URN)
Transactional (yes/no)
DLT Message Type
Message Type
Business Category
Mask
Template content.
In the Upload template list section, list the same details as above. This is a bulk upload option where you can upload many templates simultaneously. 

Once you have added the Entity ID and Template ID on Kaleyra’s Platform, these details will be auto-mapped for you, and the requests will be submitted to the operators.

info	

Information

Make sure you have done the above steps for both promotional and transactional SMS.
If you are sending SMS using Custom Connectors (now called Service Providers), please contact your SMS providers to understand how the DLT fields - Entity ID, Sender ID, and Template IDs need to be passed to them.
Update settings on the MoEngage Dashboard

If you use SMS Gupshup or Kaleyra as integrated providers, update the Sender IDs in the MoEngage Dashboard. Enter the Header ID registered and approved on the DLT platform in the Sender ID field for all the senders - for both transactional and promotional SMS. This will ensure that your SMS campaigns are not impacted.

Configure SMS as per the approved template

As per template scrubbing guidelines, you must adhere to your SMS content with the approved templates. If the SMS does not match any of the approved templates, your SMS will be rejected. 

You can pass dynamic or personalized values in #var# parameter of the approved template. Each #var# has a limit of 30 characters. You can use a combination of #var# to accommodate more number of characters. Configure the templates as required and get them approved."

Choosing a phone number
Types of Phone Numbers

There are three types of phone numbers through which brands can engage in SMS Marketing in the US:

Short Codes - Short Codes are five to six-digit numbers brands can purchase and use to send SMS and MMS messages. There are two types of shortcodes: random and vanity. Random, as the name suggests, is a short code number allotted randomly. Brands specifically choose vanity shortcodes based on their preferences from the available codes.
Leasing a Short Code - Shortcodes can also be leased through usshortcodes.com. Most vendors charge a management fee in the case of a lease, and this adds to the total cost. Thus, there is only a negligible difference between leasing a short code and purchasing one directly.
10 Digit Long Code (10-DLC) - A 10 Digit Long Code (10-DLC) is utilized for A2P (Application to Person) messaging within the United States. 10DLC was restricted from use for messaging related to marketing activities until 2021. 10-digit numbers or local numbers can be selected as the 10DLC by a brand.
Verified Toll-Free Numbers

Toll-Free numbers are 10-digit numbers that operate at no cost to the consumer and hence the name toll-free. Toll-Free numbers are designated for business messaging and are required to go through a verification process prior to use.  Brands that have their own toll-free numbers that are already being used for voice can apply to use the same number to send A2P messaging for their brand.

Options - Applicants can select from a list of available numbers or bring their own numbers.

Comparing Phone Number Types

Here is a comparison of the various phone number types based on their throughput (The number of SMSs that can be sent per second. ), timeline to provision, and cost.

Phone Number Type/Metric	Shortcode	

10-DLC

	

Verified Toll-Free Numbers




Standard Throughput

	

100 messages/second/shortcode

Short Codes have the highest throughput.

Note: Some providers allow brands to pay more for increased throughput on a short code.

	Initially, it was one message/second when 10-DLCs were launched, but now it varies based on the brand’s Trust Score and Use Case (campaign) type.  Some carriers, such as T-mobile, also impose daily message limits on A2P messages sent over 10-DLC.	

Three messages/second Additional throughput can be purchased on a number for an additional cost.  This can be a great option for a new brand, as shortcodes are expensive. When the brand begins to grow significantly over time, it would require higher throughput, and having the option to purchase additional throughput on the toll-free number is a great option.

Additional throughputs of 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 messages/second can be purchased for additional fees through some vendors.  The cost of a toll-free number with 100 messages/second throughput is the same cost as a random shortcode with a standard throughput of 100 messages/second.




Timeline to provision

	Short codes are usually allotted within 8-12 weeks after the acceptance of the application. However,  it can take longer than that too! For instance, during the early stages of the pandemic, carriers took more time than usual to provide shortcodes as applications with a pandemic-related need were given a higher priority.	To get a 10-DLC number, the brand must have completed the US A2P brand registration. In such a case,  one to five days are the usual timeframe within which the 10-DLC gets allocated.	

Toll-free numbers are usually allocated within a few days to a week from the time of application.




Total cost consideration

	

The typical cost involved is the setup fee, recurring cost, and management fee. The setup fee and recurring cost rates can vary across providers.

	

The upfront cost or the setup cost is low, and the recurring cost varies by use case.

	

There is a small set-up fee and recurring cost associated with toll-free numbers.




Setup cost

	

The setup cost is around $500-$1000 with an additional cost of $500 if the number needs to be approved to send MMS (this can be added later for the $500 fee and an additional application process).

	

The setup cost is around $0-$44. T-mobile charges a Campaign activation fee of $50 for most use cases.

	

The setup cost is $1.




Recurring cost

	

Recurring costs are charged on a quarterly basis. For a random number, the charge is $3000, and for a vanity number, the charge is $4500. Discounts are often available for annual payments.

	

The recurring cost is also low compared to shortcodes and is around $0-10/month/number.

	

For a randomly allocated number, the recurring cost is $2/month, and the cost is 50 cents per month when the brand brings its own number.

info	

Note

CTIA does not allow any numbers (shortcodes, 10 DLC, and toll-free) to be shared.  In the past, shortcodes could be shared by many brands, but in 2021, the CTIA moved away from that support and now prohibits sharing of numbers.  For Example, the GAP owns many brands, but their brands, Athleta and Old Navy, cannot share the same shortcode. They must have their own numbers."

Subscription Management and Keywords
Subscription Management - Overview

SMS Subscription Management enables customers to opt-in or opt-out of receiving SMS notifications. MoEngage complies with the United States SMS regulations. For more information on the regulations, refer to SMS Regulations in the US.

Subscription management begins when the customer signs up to receive communication from the brand and ends when the customer cancels the same.

Opt-ins and Types

Opt-In means that the user has consented (or opted-in) to receive messages from the brand. MoEngage supports single and double opt-ins.

Single Opt-in - In a single opt-in process, users turn into subscribers and receive a confirmation text when they text a keyword or submit an opt-in form. They are not required to confirm their opt-in.
Double Opt-in - In a double opt-in process, users need to confirm that they would like to receive text messages from the brand by opting in. When a user texts a keyword or submits an opt-in form, they are sent an opt-in text to which they must reply with ‘YES’ or a similar keyword. Their opt-in status will be set to opt-in pending until they reply. Once the user replies with the specific opt-in keyword, they will be considered to have opted in and will receive the confirmation text for the same. Click here to learn about how to create event triggered campaigns for a double opt-in process with MoEngage. 

Double opt-in is a recommended practice but is not mandatory. Even though using double opt-in is not a legal requirement of the TCPA, it creates a digital trail and proof of customers' written permission to receive text marketing updates and protects your brand from unnecessary compliance hurdles.

 

 
When to use a single opt-in flow?

In a text-to-join program(where a customer signs up to receive messages from the brand using SMS), a keyword is initiated from the subscriber’s mobile phone, and a single opt-in flow will meet the compliance requirements. Single opt-in is commonly used for text-to-join programs.

When to use a double opt-in flow?

A double opt-in is a confirmation process where the customer's express consent is sought. It is recommended for opt-in forms such as a web form-based opt-in or imports. Double opt-in is used primarily when the users submit their mobile numbers on online forms.

MoEngage Subscription Management and Keywords use a single opt-in flow as the keywords originate from the user’s mobile device. If you’re using Sign-up unit templates through On-site messaging on the web, a double opt-in flow is initiated to be compliant with TCPA guidelines.

Ways to get Opt-Ins

MoEngage allows two ways to get opt-ins from users and they are Keywords and Sign-up units.

Keywords

MoEngage uses Keywords (a set of single words that are used to track the user's SMS Subscription Status)to track the consent information of the customer. Keywords are of two types:

A standard set of reserved words such as START, STOP, HELP, INFO, and so on.
Custom single words such as BALANCE, 25OFF, and so on.
 
Keyword Categories and Auto Responders

Keywords can be categorized as Opt-In, Opt-Out, Help, and so on. Keywords and keyword categories can be added and configured in MoEngage. For every keyword category, a list of keywords and an auto-response message can be added.

Auto response messages are automated messages that will be sent when the users respond with any of the keywords in the keyword categories. For example, 'Reply with START to subscribe' could be added as part of the message sent to the customer to categorically seek their informed consent.

When the customer replies with any of the keywords that have been configured, MoEngage will track the response and update the standard user attribute SMS Subscription Status.

For more information on adding keywords and keyword categories, refer to Keyword Management.

Opt-in Status

MoEngage tracks customer consent in the standard user attribute SMS Subscription Status, which can have the following statuses.

Status	Description
OPTIN	MoEngage has gotten consent from users to receive SMS notifications.
OPTOUT	MoEngage has gotten confirmation that the users do not wish to receive SMS notifications.
OPT-IN PENDING	MoEngage has gotten confirmation that the user has signed up to receive the SMS notifications but has not explicitly consented to receive SMS notifications.
EMPTY	MoEngage has not gotten informed consent from the user to receive SMS notifications. For example, first-time users.
Migrate Opt-ins

MoEngage provides a standard attribute called SMS Subscription Status where you can update your user's opt-in preferences.

You can do it using either of the following methods:

User Import/Update feature that MoEngage provides under Segment->Import Users on MoEngage Dashboard. The attribute that needs to be updated is SMS Subscription Status. Read more about it here.

MoEngage stores the SMS subscription preferences of all the users in the backend permanently.  However, this data is visible in the UI for a period of nine months. Brands can fetch this historical subscription preference data upon request.

info	

Note

MoEngage natively integrates with Twilio and Sinch and manages the subscriptions and keywords. MoEngage does not support Subscription and Keyword Management for custom connectors/service providers.

SMS Sign-up Units

Sign-up units are forms filled out by customers to subscribe to receiving text messages from the brand. The MoEngage platform allows marketers to create, design, and manage the sign-up units and add automation for welcome flows directly. Sign-up units can be used to grow the subscriber lists and convert website and app visitors to SMS subscribers. Sign-up units are designed to remain TCPA compliant through in-built legal text, terms of service, and privacy policy placeholders in our templates.

Configuring Sign-up Units

In-App templates can be used to nudge mobile app users to sign-up for SMS; click here for more information. On-Site Messaging Templates can be used to convert website visitors to SMS subscribers; click here for more information.

Impact on Campaigns

When the SMS Subscription Management Toggle is enabled:

MoEngage will drop users with subscription status as 'EMPTY', 'OPT-IN PENDING', and 'OPTOUT' from campaigns and mark them as 'Not Reachable via SMS'.
For active campaigns(periodic or event-triggered campaigns), the users who have SMS Subscription Status as 'EMPTY', 'OPT-IN PENDING', and 'OPTOUT' will be dropped in the next instance when the campaign is run.
 
Using Event-Triggered Campaigns for Opt-In Pending Users

When a user has signed up to receive SMS notifications but has not expressly consented to receive SMS notifications, marketers can send a message to acquire consent via keywords.

For example, the double opt-in flow described above. When a user subscribes to SMS notifications externally, an Opt_In Pending event must be fired to inform MoEngage that the user has performed such an action. Marketers can send event-triggered campaigns to such users checking if the user has executed the Opt-In Pending event in the trigger criteria as shown below. 

Overruling Preference Management Settings

To overrule preference management settings for such an event triggered campaign, enable the 'Send campaign to the users opted out in preference management' toggle in the Select audience section, as shown below.

warning	

Disclaimer

Users who are yet to give their express consent for receiving SMS notifications can only be sent a consent acquisition message, and this is limited to one message for every user initiation.

MoEngage will now set the standard user attribute SMS Subscription Status to OPT-IN PENDING. When the user replies with any keyword from the Opt-in category, only then will the user be considered to have subscribed to the SMS notifications. MoEngage will set the attribute SMS Subscription Status as OPTIN here.

For more information, refer to Create SMS Campaign.

Adding Opt-out Instructions

You can add the opt-out instruction in the SMS content. This is used to let the user know how they can unsubscribe from receiving SMS notifications.

info	

Note

It is recommended that this instruction be included once in every four or five campaigns.

Impact on Preference Management

SMS Subscription Management settings overrule the Preference Management settings for SMS.  For more information, refer to Preference Management for SMS.

The settings cannot be changed in Preference Management when SMS Subscription Management is enabled, as shown below.

SMS Reachability in the User Profile

You can view the status of users who have subscribed or have not subscribed to the SMS notifications under 'Reachability' in the User Profile. For more information on user profiles, refer to User Profile."

Fuzzy Opt-out
 	

Early Access

This is an Early Access feature. To enable it for your account, contact your CSM or raise a support ticket.

Overview

The Fuzzy Opt-Out feature in MoEngage helps you comply with the latest U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations for managing SMS subscriptions. This feature improves the accuracy of identifying and processing opt-out requests, even when users enter incorrect, misspelled, or alternative versions of opt-out keywords. It helps prevent sending SMS marketing messages to users who intend to unsubscribe, which protects the user experience and reduces compliance risks. The feature effectively handles common opt-out phrases and certain offensive terms to ensure your campaigns remain user-friendly and compliant.  

Key Highlights

Some of the key highlights of this feature are as follows:

New attribute: A boolean attribute, Is Fuzzy Match, has been added to the SMS Keyword Received event.
When Is Fuzzy Match is True:
The keyword type is stored as OPTOUT.  
The user's subscription status is updated to OPTOUT.  
Advanced keyword detection: The algorithm handles scenarios involving:
Variations in letter casing.  
Leading or trailing spaces.  
Common typos, abbreviations, or alternative spellings of opt-out keywords (using fuzzy matching).
Offensive language handling: Messages containing offensive or vulgar language are treated as opt-out requests to avoid offending users with unwanted communication.
Error management:
Missed opt-outs: Although the algorithm handles many cases, some user inputs intended as opt-outs might not be detected correctly.  
Incorrect classifications: Some messages might be mistakenly classified as opt-out requests because of ambiguous user input.  
How Fuzzy Opt-Out Works

When a user replies to your SMS campaigns, the Fuzzy Opt-Out algorithm processes the message as follows:

Direct matching: The user's message is compared against a predefined list of opt-out keywords. This includes exact matches (for example, STOP or unsubscribe) and variations with different casing or extra spaces (for example, stop or UNSUBSCRIBE).  
Fuzzy matching for misspelled or varied keywords: Fuzzy search logic identifies messages with typos or variations. For example, messages like Stahp, Cansel, Unsubcribe, or opt-out are detected as opt-out requests. Messages unrelated to opt-out intent are not detected.  
Offensive language identification: Messages with offensive language that users generally do not wish to receive are marked as opt-out requests. 
Subscription update: If an opt-out intent is confirmed (through direct or fuzzy matching), the user’s subscription status is updated to OPTOUT.  
Behavior Without Fuzzy Opt-Out Enabled

If the Fuzzy Opt-Out feature is disabled, MoEngage only recognizes:  

Exact keyword matches.  
Minor variations, like differences in letter casing or leading and trailing spaces.  

Typos, abbreviations, or alternative spellings are not recognized.  

Example Scenarios

The following table shows how different user responses are handled:

User Response	Action Taken	Reasoning
STOP	Opted Out	Exact match to a predefined opt-out keyword.
stop	Opted Out	Matched keyword; case differences handled.
Stahp	Opted Out	Fuzzy match detected for a typo of Stop.
stopppppppp	Opted Out	Fuzzy match detected for a typo of Stop.
atop	Opted Out	Fuzzy match detected for a typo of Stop.
Messages containing profanity	Opted Out	Explicit offensive term identified as opt-out.
Cancel my subscription	Opted Out	Contains the opt-out keyword Cancel.
""Hey, just opt me out!""	Opted Out	Fuzzy matching detected opt-out.
HELP	No Action	Non-opt-out keyword detected.
Hello 😊	No Action	Neutral intent detected (not opt-out).
Compliance Benefits

Some of the compliance benefits are as follows:

Enhanced user experience: Ensures users are removed from campaigns when they express an intent to opt out, even with misspellings or extra spaces.  
FCC compliance: Helps meet U.S. regulations requiring businesses to honor opt-out requests promptly and accurately.  
Risk mitigation: Reduces the chance of fines and complaints from incorrectly processed or missed opt-out requests.  
Limitations and Considerations

Some of the limitations and considerations are as follows:

False negatives: Some opt-out attempts might be missed if the user's input is ambiguous or uses highly unique phrasing that the algorithm cannot detect.  
False positives: Some messages, particularly those with borderline or casual language, might be incorrectly classified as opt-out requests.  
Custom keyword handling: Businesses should define additional specific opt-out keywords during setup for unique scenarios.  
Conclusion

The Fuzzy Opt-Out feature is a valuable tool for keeping SMS campaigns compliant, building user trust, and minimizing risks. However, it may not cover every possible case. We recommend periodically monitoring opt-out behavior to identify areas for refinement. Use this feature to keep customers satisfied while staying compliant with regulations."

FAQs about Subscription Analytics

In this article, we've covered frequently asked questions about SMS Subscription Management. 

How do I get the number of opt-ins and opt-outs over time?

The number of opt-ins/opt-outs can be obtained using the SMS Keyword Received Event. This event gets triggered when a user responds to an auto-responder message with any of the keywords configured in any of the keyword categories.

Depending on the keyword category (represented by the keyword_type event attribute) that the user response falls in, the user is opted in or opted out. Their subscription status is updated in the SMS Subscription Status user property. This event and its attribute can be used to calculate the number of opt-ins and opt-outs, as shown below.

Opt-ins over time
Opt-outs over time

To get the number of opt-ins over time, do the following:

Navigate to Analyze -> Behavior -> Events & Filters section and choose the event as SMS Keyword Received.
Choose the Filter by condition as Keyword Type is OPTIN, as shown in the image below.
Click on Apply. The opt-in statistics are displayed in the behavior chart, as shown in the image below.
How do I get the total number of active SMS subscribers?

The number of active SMS subscribers can be obtained by looking at the count of the number of users who have opted in. If a user has opted in, the SMS Subscription Status user property would be 'OPTIN' for them.

To get the total number of active SMS subscribers, do the following:

Navigate to Segment -> Create Segment and select the 'Filter Users by' radio button.
Select the Filter condition as 'SMS Subscription Status' is OPTIN as shown in the image below.
Click on show count, and you'll have the total number of active SMS subscribers."

Trigger Criteria

This section describes the trigger criteria for the In-app campaign.

On session start
 
On screen load
 
On custom event

A session refers to a single period of user interaction with the mobile app. It includes all activities like screen navigation, actions, and events during that time. The session starts when the user first interacts with the app, and the start time is recorded. The following scenarios define the end of a session:

If a user logs out of the application.
If the current session is active and the user has entered the session from another traffic source.
If the user is inactive for longer than the defined inactivity period (default is 30 mins).

Session duration is determined as the difference between the session's start and end times.

By selecting On session start, you can show the In-app message to the user as soon as the app session starts. 

Under the Select trigger time section, select Immediately to send the message as soon as the campaign is published, or select After Delay to send the message after a specified time.

info	

Note

Make sure to add a delay so the In-app message does not appear on the splash screen.

Campaign Audience Limit

This feature empowers you to control campaign reach and expenditure by capping the number of users who receive it based on engagement metrics like sends, impressions, and conversions. It allows you to set total, daily, or instance-level limits to campaigns. For more information, refer to Campaign Audience Limit.

In-session Attributes

In-session attributes enable you to group and target users based on their actions within the current app session. For example, by utilizing in-session attributes, onboarding flows can be exclusively displayed to new users visiting your app for the first time. This method ensures that these users receive a customized experience right away during their initial session.

To add an in-session attribute:

Click the + In-session attributes button and select the required attribute from the list.

Use And/Or to combine multiple in-session attributes.


Select the Exclude Users check box to exclude users based on their in-session activity.

You can use the following in-session attributes with your in-app campaign:

Query Parameter: This attribute lets you segment users based on the query parameters in the URL. Typically, users would land on your personalized URL by clicking an advertisement on any social media platform.
You can use UTM parameters to segment users based on the source from where they are visiting, the campaign from which they've landed on this URL, and so on. 
UTM parameters like utm_source identify the campaigns driving users to websites. You can use UTM and custom parameters to segment users and personalize the experience.
User Type: This attribute lets you segment users based on whether they are new or returning. The SDK stores user details (unique_id) for each user in the app storage. The user is considered a Returning User if the associated user details exist in the SDK data storage. Otherwise, the user is considered New.  Hence, if the user clears the app cache, the user is considered new.
Note: If two users (User 1 and User 2) are using the same device and User 2 logs in after User 1, User 2 would be considered a returning user.
Day of the Week: This attribute lets you segment users based on the day of the week on which they visit your app.
Time of the Day: This attribute lets you segment users based on the hour of the day on which they visit your app. You can choose from any of the one-hour slots in a day available in the list.
GeoLocation: This attribute lets you segment users based on their geolocation when they visit your app. You can choose the country, state/region, and city where the user is located or exclude a specific country.
Control Group

This section contains information about control groups for the campaign. Control Groups are enabled only for promotional campaigns. They are not applicable for transactional campaigns. You can enable the control groups to which you want to send the promotional campaign.

In the Control group section:

Turn the Global control group toggle on to not send the campaign to all the users in the control group

Create In-App Campaign for TV

To create an In-App campaign for TV:

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard and select Engage > Campaigns from the left navigation.
Click  at the top right corner of the All Campaigns Page.
Select In-App from the Inbound channels listed.
Steps to Create an In-App Campaign for TV

There are three steps to creating an In-App campaign, and they are:

Target users: Define the target audience for the campaign
Content: Define the content of the push notification to be sent
Schedule and Goals: Define the campaign's delivery schedule and goals
Step 1: Target Users

On the target users page, navigate to the Target Platforms section. Choose TV as a platform and select the TV OS Type where you want to run your In-App Campaign. You must choose at least one of the OS Types from the list. 

 

If you want to know more about the various fields on this page, refer to Target Users.

 

info	

Note

You can not select TV as a platform along with Web or Mobile Web. You must only select 'TV' to proceed further.
The trigger criteria 'On Specific Screen' is currently not supported with In-App campaigns for TV. This feature will be released soon.

 

Step 2: Content

You will get redirected to the Template selection page. Select a template for TV from those that are available and click on Select Template to proceed to the editor. 

You can customize the templates with the help of the In-App NATIV editor. The editor allows you to edit the image, background, and text on the template, along with multiple other items.

The NATIV editor also provides you with the View in TV preview button which lets you see exactly how the In-App campaign will render on a TV screen. However, this preview does not show the buttons in focus mode.

To know more about the editing options in the In-App NATIV editor, refer to In-App NATIV Version 3. 

Editing Buttons for Focus System

Unlike touch interfaces, TV heavily relies on a focus state to draw the user's attention to the focused element. This serves as the starting point for navigation. The navigation on a TV is constraining as users can only use a remote control device.

While on Focus, the user can use the navigational button to move to other focusable elements or click OK (or a similar button depending on the OS) to take the action associated with the focused element.

With MoEngage's In-App NATIV editor, you can edit the buttons with the help of the Focused section:

The Focused sub-section allows you to edit the Font size, Font color, and Button color of your button. 
Ensure that the button looks different in focus mode as it helps with the navigation on TV.

After you have made the desired changes and edits, click on Next to proceed to Schedule and goals. 

info	

Note

Action items can only be added to buttons in the TV templates. If you add actions to other widgets, then they will not work.   

 

Step 3: Schedule and Goals

Select the sending criteria, conversion goals, and other details for your campaign. If you want to know more about the Schedule and goals page, refer to Scheduling and goals.

After filling in these details, click on Publish to publish your campaign. 

info	

Note

Some of the delivery control settings may not work for In-App campaigns created for Apple TV OS due to limited device storage.

 

Congratulations, you have successfully created an In-App campaign for TV!"

MoEngage recommends testing the message to be sent in the campaign to ensure that it is displayed as expected on a wide range of devices. The message previews in the MoEngage Dashboard might differ from the actual display on a device due to the variety of devices available. The Test Campaign feature will help you test the In-App messages on the devices of your choice.

In-App Nativ Version 3

If you are using the In-App Nativ Version 3, you can see the Test Campaign functionality in Step-2 of campaign creation after you define your In-App message. 


In-App Nativ Version 2

The Test Campaign functionality is available on the last step of campaign creation before activating the campaign for In-App Nativ Version 2, as shown below (same for both general In-App and event triggered In-App).

How does it work?

The Test Campaign feature lets you see your In-App messages on your app and test key functionalities like animations and on-click actions. To receive an In-App message on your device before activating the campaign for your live users, navigate to the test campaign section during campaign creation and select an attribute to identify your user for testing, as shown below.

The identifiers are any device identifier (like Google Advertising Id, IDFA, push_id) or any user identifier like ID, Email Id, Mobile Number, and so on.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Ensure that the properties are set for your user in MoEngage before you use these for the test campaign.

If MoEngage cannot identify the user with the selected attribute and value, the following error message is displayed.

	

If MoEngage successfully identifies the user with the selected attribute and value, the following error message is displayed.

	

When the Test Campaign is successfully sent to your user, you will receive a push notification on your device, as shown below:

On clicking this push notification, your app will open up, and you will see the In-App message there, as shown below. It may take up to 15 seconds for the message to be shown via Test Campaign (for your live campaigns, there would not be any delay).

 

info	

Information

The push notification is only received in case of Test Campaign functionality and will not be sent for your live campaigns. For your live campaigns, your users will see the In-App message directly after they qualify for the campaign and execute the trigger action.

Test Campaigns ignore frequency capping and display controls and can just be used to test the look and feel of the message.

Test Campaign functionality in Version 2

If you use Version 2 (older version) of In-App Nativ, you might face intermittent issues while using the Test Campaign functionality where the In-App message does not appear on your app after clicking the push notification. This is a known issue and happens because of custom re-direction that you may have implemented inside your app. To fix this issue, update your SDK Version to the current version so you can use the Test Campaign functionality seamlessly.

Test Campaign functionality in Version 3

With Version 3 of In-App Nativ, if you are targeting the older generation of In-App SDK Versions (Android SDK < 10000 and iOS SDK < 6.0.0), then you will have to select the checkbox for this option as shown below:

	

This ensures that your Test Campaigns will continue to work on your older generation of SDKs. The recommended approach, however, is to update the MoEngage SDK you have used to the latest version."

Test Your In-App Campaign

You can now test your In-app campaign as your users would see it. Initially, you could preview your campaigns and test their UI, but now, you can perform end-to-end tests throughout their run.

 

This feature is available for all trigger types and lets you test the trigger condition, targeting options, and delivery controls of your In-app campaign. 

Testing Your In-app Campaign

To test your campaign, go to the third step of the campaign creation process and click on Test Campaign. 

Configure

To configure your test, input the following details:

Target Platform: Choose Android as your target platform. 
Note: Currently, this feature is only available for Android devices. 
Unique Identifier: Select the unique identifier to use for testing your campaign. You have an option to choose between six different user attributes. 




Enter the Unique Identifier: Enter the unique identifier for the device on which you want to test your In-App campaign.

After entering these details, click on Send Test Campaign to proceed further. A push notification will be sent to your device. Follow the steps in the next stage to continue. 

Perform

At this stage, you will see a list of steps that you will need to perform to test your campaign. These steps will depend on the configuration you set while creating your campaign. 

There can be different steps based on the following three trigger criteria - 

On App Open
On Specific Screen
On Custom Event
On App Open 

To perform the test, follow the steps mentioned. For example, in this case, you just need to click on the push notification. Since the trigger is ""On App Open"", the pop-up should appear as soon as you open the app. 

After performing these steps, click on View Test Results to find out whether your In-App campaign was sent successfully or not. 

On Specific Screen

If you want to test In-App campaigns with the campaign trigger being On Specific Screen, you will see an additional step under Perform these steps. 

This step will be: Go to screen: The screen you choose

To successfully test this In-App campaign, you must navigate to the screen that you choose to view the campaign. For example, if you want to show the campaign on your Checkout Screen, you must navigate to your app's checkout screen during this process. 

After viewing the In-App campaign, click on View Test Results to proceed.

On Custom Event

This feature also allows you to test the In-App campaigns with custom trigger events. If you have created your campaign using the custom trigger, you will see that as a step while testing your campaign. 

This step will be: Perform trigger: The trigger you selected. 

To successfully test this In-App campaign, you will need to perform the trigger that you have selected to view the campaign. For example, if you want to show the campaign on the ""Add to cart"" trigger, you must click the ""add to cart"" button during this process. 

After performing the steps, click on View Test Results to proceed.

 

info	

Information

If you do not perform the steps correctly, the test results will display an error and you must start the testing process again.

 

Results

On the test results screen, you will find out if your In-App campaign ran successfully. 

If you see a list with green checks under Test Results then your campaign has run successfully. You can also use the testing device to view the In-App campaign and see if all of the visual elements are appearing correctly. 

If you see a list with red crosses under Test Results then your campaign has not run successfully. The errors will be listed under the events and you can fix them and Re-test your campaign.
Click on the Re-test button on the bottom right-hand side of the pop-up to re-test your In-App campaign.




If your campaign trigger was On Custom Event, then you will see another point under Test Results called Perform trigger. If you were able to perform the trigger event, there will be a green check next to the Perform trigger and your test should be successful. 




Otherwise, you will see a red cross next to the Perform trigger and an error message will be displayed detailing exactly what went wrong.

Contextual In-App Messages

Mobile Apps are built using activities and fragments, and while showing personalized in-app messages to your users, you may want to only show them only on specific screens of your app or specific parts of a screen like fragments.

Enabling ""Show in specific fragments/sections"" for your Account

This feature is available by default with Version 3 of In-App Nativ and is supported on  Android SDK Version greater than 10.0.00 and iOS SDK Version greater than 6.0.0.

Restricting In-App Messages to specific app Fragments

With our Version 3 of  In-App Nativ campaigns, you can restrict your in-app messages to specific app fragments or for any specific context of your app. Earlier our InApp messages could only be restricted to certain app screens (rather than activities or view controllers). You can now restrict your in-app nativ campaigns to specific app contexts as defined during integration.

The most popular use case for this feature is to restrict in-app campaigns to specific app fragments. To restrict in-app messages to a specific app context, you can enter the context under Display Settings here.

This step is optional and you can leave the input box for Show only in App Context empty if you do not want to restrict the message to a few app contexts only.


Integration Steps required for restricting in-app messages to specific app fragments

Follow the integration changes mentioned in the documents referenced below to restrict in-app messages to app fragments.


ANDROID

In-App notifications are triggered based on context, hence if your application has a Single Activity and multiple fragments, In-App message will only be shown on application launch. This might not always be ideal in many cases and you may want to trigger in-app notifications at a later point of time in the application's lifecycle. To have such control, follow the steps mentioned in our Android Integration Document.

iOS

We have introduced context-based InApps with SDK version 6.0.0. While creating InApp campaigns, you can set the contexts OR tags for the campaign. The SDK will check with the current context set in the App and show the inApp only when a current set context matches the campaign context. To implement this feature for your iOS app, refer to our iOS integration document."

Key-Value Pairs in In-App Campaigns

Key-value (KV) pairs are additional data elements linked to specific actions in an In-app Messaging campaign. Each KV pair consists of a key and a value. The key serves as a descriptor, and the value is the data related to that descriptor. Using KV pairs, you can provide additional information to the app when the user interacts with the campaign to create more personalized, dynamic, and trackable user experiences.

Among the actions, KV pairs are available in:

Navigation 
Track event
Custom action

To add a KV pair, perform the following steps:
After choosing a template in the Content section, select a widget from the Preview section on the right.

Scroll down to the Actions section and click + Action.


Select the action from the Custom list.
Click + New KV pair to add a KV pair to this action.


Under Key value pairs, enter the key in the Enter name field and the value in the Data field.

Here is an explanation of some key-value pairs for each action and the reasons to use them:

Navigation
What are KV pairs in this context?

KV pairs are parameters passed with the navigation action to provide additional context or instructions to the destination screen or URL within the app.

For example:

Key: productId, Value: 12345
Key: source, Value: inAppCampaign
Key: email, Value: {{UserAttribute['u_em']}}
Why should they be used?
Personalization: KV pairs allow you to direct users to specific content based on their interests or behavior. By passing parameters like productId, you can navigate users to a particular product page. By passing email, you can prefill the next page with the user’s email.
Dynamic content loading: The app can use the KV pairs to fetch and display content dynamically, improving user experience.
Tracking and analytics: Including parameters like source helps in tracking the origin of the navigation, which is valuable for analytics and measuring campaign effectiveness.
Track Event
What are KV pairs in this context?

When tracking an event, KV pairs serve as event attributes, providing additional details about the event.

For example:

Event Name: ButtonClicked
Key: buttonType, Value: SubscribeButton
Key: campaignId, Value: promo_2024

Why should they be used?
Enhanced analytics: KV pairs enrich event data, allowing for deeper insights into user behavior.
Segmentation: Detailed event attributes enable precise user segmentation for future campaigns.
Trigger automated actions: Specific KV pairs can trigger other automated marketing actions within MoEngage, such as sending follow-up messages.
Custom Action
What are KV pairs in this context?

In a custom action, developers can use key value pairs as custom parameters to pass to the app’s code. They can then utilize these parameters to execute specific actions.

For example:

Action Name: OpenFeature
Key: featureName, Value: AugmentedRealityViewer
Key: accessLevel, Value: premium

Why should they be used?
Flexibility: Developers can define versatile actions using KV pairs and modify them without altering the app code.
Personalized user experience: Developers can pass different parameters to tailor the app’s behavior to individual users or specific campaign goals.
Dynamic updates: KV pairs enable the app to respond to in-app messages with up-to-date information, enhancing engagement."

In-app rating prompt
Overview

Marketers employ feedback mechanisms such as rating prompts to assess user sentiment. This article describes how you can use MoEngage to gather feedback.

You can do it by directing users to the Play store/ App store or showing native rating prompts directly in the app. These options are discussed below.

Directing users to the Play Store/ App Store

You can ask users to share their ratings and reviews by directing them to the Play Store or App Store. To do this, add a deep link on the button of your pop-up. This deep link should direct the users to your Play Store review page. For more information, refer to the deep-linking action section for In-App button elements.

 

 

Showing native rating prompt directly in the app

You can use MoEngage to show a native rating prompt in-app and allow users to submit a rating through the native App Store review prompt without leaving the app.

 

Things to know
Limits for native in-app rating prompts 

There are limits to the number of times you can show rating prompts on both the Android and iOS platforms. As per Apple's guidelines, app review prompts can be displayed for a user up to three times a year, while Android enforces a time-bound quota for how often you can show rating prompts to users.

Best Practices for asking for ratings and reviews from users 

Google and Apple have laid down some best practices to be followed when asking users for ratings and reviews. For more information, refer to Google and Apple's articles on ratings and reviews.

info	

Note

Since you can only show the native rating prompt a set number of times to the user, it's good to gauge their interest using a pop-up and show the native rating prompt only if they agree to rate the app.

To add a native rating prompt in the app, do the following:

Navigate to the create an in-app campaign page and select the Popup - Rating with Image or Popup - Rating without Image.
Add the desired details in the template.
Select the button widget and click +Action.
Add a key-value pair. For example, the key can be ""show_native_rating"", and the value can be set to ""true"". Your engineering team must implement the code to call the native prompt when the custom action happens.


To show the prompt, follow the instructions in the iOS and Android guides."

Template Types

Use different types of templates based on your requirements:

Template Type	Description
Popup	These templates are rendered in the center of the screen over a transparent overlay. Use this template when you want to divert the user's attention towards a sale or discount.
Full Screen	Full-screen templates occupy the whole screen and block the app completely. These templates are useful when you want to divert the user's attention to something like a mandatory app update. Know more here.
Rating	The 5-star rating template is a special template of In-App Nativ. This is also a pop-up template and allows the user to interact with the template and provide a rating, which is used for re-targeting as well. Know more here.
Nudges	

These are non-intrusive templates that allow your users to continue to interact with the app. Nudges are either embedded inside the app, at the top or bottom of the screen, or appear over the screen. Use these templates when you want to alert your users about some new information, sale day, and so on.
For nudges, you need additional SDK integration, as mentioned in the developer documentation. Make sure you do not select ""On custom event"" trigger criteria while creating nudges, as nudges do not work with event triggers.

Note: To ensure that your InApp Nudges are visible within the visible section of the app interface in iOS, toggle on the iOS Safe Area in the Template Settings section of the Content Creation Step for the iOS platform, as shown in the image below.


Self Handled	With the Self Handled Template, you can leverage MoEngage In-App campaign delivery, segmentation smart trigger, and personalize but render the message yourself as required. This allows you to create complex visuals for your messages while leveraging other In-App capabilities.
Customizing Native In-App Templates

While using our InApp Native campaigns, there are a few guidelines that need to be followed to ensure that your in-app templates look the best on all devices.

Customizing Images

We recommend our In-App Nativ users upload images of high definition but not exceeding 1 or 2 MB in size. This is because before an In-App message is shown on the device, the image within the message is downloaded from a CDN before being shown to the user. If a user is on a slower internet connection, it might take longer for the image to be downloaded and hence there will be a delay to show the in-app message to this user.

Aspect Ratio of Images

The following are MoEngage recommended aspect ratios of images for each template type -

Template Name	Recommended Aspect Ratio (width:height)
Popup - Image, Text & 3 Buttons	Message re-sizes to fit images of most sizes. MoEngage recommends aspect ratio for this template is 1:1 and about 50*50 pixels or more in size.
Popup - Image, Text & Button	Message re-sizes to fit images of most sizes. MoEngage recommends aspect ratios include 1:2, 2:3, 3:2, 2:1 etc. and at least 450*450 in dimension so that the image does not distort
Popup - Image, Header, Text & Button	Message re-sizes to fit images of most sizes. MoEngage recommends aspect ratios include 1:2, 2:3, 3:2, 2:1 and so on, and at least 450*450 in dimension so that the image does not distort
Popup - Image & 2 Buttons	Message re-sizes to fit images of most sizes. MoEngage recommends aspect ratios include 1:2, 2:3, 3:2, 2:1 and so on, and at least 450*450 in dimension so that the image does not distort
Popup - Rating with Image	Message re-sizes to fit images of most sizes. MoEngage recommends aspect ratio for this template is 1:1 and about 50*50 pixels or more in size.
Popup - Image	Message re-sizes to fit images of most sizes. High-resolution Max 1200*2000 pixels and Min 450*450 pixels
Popup - Image & Button	Message re-sizes to fit images of most sizes. High-resolution Max 1200*2000 pixels and Min 600*600 pixels
Full Screen - Image, Text & Button	Use Images of aspect ratio 3:4 or 3:5 and at least 450*600 pixels so that the image does not distort on larger devices device.
Full Screen - Image	Use Images of aspect ratio 3:4 or 3:5 and at least 450*600 pixels so that the image does not distort on larger devices device.
Nudge - Image	Use wide images with an aspect ratio of approximately 5:1 or 6:1.
SMS Sign-up	
warning	

Warning

Only enabled for the North America region.

For more information, reach out to support@moenage.com.

Use to enable users to sign-up and consent to receive SMS notifications. Two types of templates are available - Fullscreen - SMS Sign-up with image and Popup - SMS Sign-up without image.

Accepted image types

For In-App Nativ, you can upload .png, .jpeg, and .gif as images in any of the In-App native templates. Note that for using GIFs in Android In-App Native, you need to ensure that the integration steps mentioned here are done. GIFs are supported by default on the iOS platform.

Image Quality and Size

For In-App Nativ templates, try to use high-resolution images so that they do not distort even on large screens. The higher the image size, the higher the chances of the image failing to download on a device with a flaky internet connection. Use images of less than 2MB in size so as to keep a good balance between image quality and time for download.

Scaling Images as per device dimensions

The In-App messages you create are rendered on devices with different form factors and dpi. As a result, the image that you upload on the dashboard is scaled down or scaled up when it is rendered on devices of different dimensions. For example, you upload an image of dimensions 600*1000 pixels (width * height) on a device for the template - Popup - Image. Now when this message is displayed on a device with width = 320 pixels where the in-app message occupies about 400 pixels width. In this case, we will scale down the image width to 300 pixels and calculate the height basis the aspect ratio of the image (3:5) which is 500 pixels. So the 600*1000 pixels image will be scaled down to 300*500 pixels. This way the image will never break. When images are scaled up or down, it is important to know that we only scale the width and calculate the height basis the aspect ratio of the image so that the image is not distorted when it is displayed.

Background Images

Configure background images for the In-App messages.

On the Content tab of step 2 of campaign creation, click Template Settings
In the Template background image, use one of the following:
Click Image URL and type or paste the URL of the image.
Click Upload Image and drag and drop the image or click the upload from the computer the stored image.

warning	

Warning

Background images are not scaled like the other images of the In-App content. Instead, the background image fit the width and height of the message that is calculated by the inner widgets. The background image might stretch due to the calculations.

Background Color

Background color allows you to add a background to your in-app messages. It can also be removed to make your messages transparent.

On the Content tab of step 2 of campaign creation, click Template Settings.
In the Background color, select the color.
In the Phone Background color, select the color.

Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Android SDK Version to 11.4.00, iOS SDK Version to 7.1.00 and React Native SDK version to 7.3.0

Introduction

You can leverage HTML In-app messages to create and use complex In-app messaging layouts to engage your app users when they are inside the app.

The following capabilities are supported with HTML In-app messages.

Use HTML templates for showing pop-ups inside your mobile apps. This will unlock features like surveys, lead gen, spin the wheel, and so on with In-App campaigns. Sample templates are available here.
Support for Landscape and Portrait mode with In-App messaging campaigns
Support for Tablets and TV Os with In-App messaging campaigns
Upload custom HTML Templates: Create your own In-App templates and upload them as a ZIP file or simply paste your HTML while creating In-app campaigns.
Creating HTML In-app Campaigns

In the second step of In-app campaign creation (content section of campaign creation), there are three tabs, and they are:

All templates
Custom template editor
Saved templates

Four standard pre-built HTML templates are available in the All Templates section and can be used for campaign creation. The Custom template editor allows for the creation of HTML templates, and the HTML code can be typed or pasted to the editor. 

Pre-Built HTML Templates in All Templates Section

To use HTML templates with In-app campaigns, please follow the below steps:

Select In-App from the Inbound section in the Create Campaigns menu (Navigation: Create New-> Engage -> Campaign -> In-bound).
On the In-app campaign creation page, fill in the campaign name, choose the target platform(s), trigger criteria, target audience, and control group in the first step of campaign creation.
In Step 2, navigate to the 'All templates' tab and scroll down to the HTML templates section as shown below.
There are 4 HTML templates and an option to create a custom HTML template using the custom HTML editor. Choose the HTML template of your choice or create a custom HTML template.
Pre-Built HTML Templates

There are four HTML templates that are supported by MoEngage, and they are:

Survey Templates
Popup-Promotional
FullScreen- Lead Gen
FullScreen- Carousel
Gamification Templates - Spin the Wheel and Scratch Card
Survey Templates

Survey templates are pre-designed layouts or formats that you can use to quickly create a survey. They often come with pre-written questions common to a specific type of survey, such as customer satisfaction, employee feedback, event evaluation, and so on. You can find survey templates by selecting the “survey” filter under the “filter by use case” section. The following survey templates are available for In-App campaigns:

Popup Survey Template

Survey Popup and Emoji 
Survey popup- Radio buttons with emoji
Survey popup - Multi Screen
Survey popup - NPS Slider

Popup Survey Template

As the name suggests, this template is used for conducting pop-up surveys on mobile devices. The following image illustrates how this template will appear on a mobile device in portrait mode.

The HTML code for this template is pre-populated in the 'Code View' section of content creation as shown below.

Details of the Pop-up Survey Template

This template can be used to capture the user's response to a survey.

Step 1: Capture the user response in a user attribute

The survey response is captured as a user attribute, as shown in the image below. The code view shows the template's HTML code, and line 88 in the code for the Popup-Survey Template deals with capturing the input given by the user as a user attribute - ""survey_response"". You can customize the user attribute name as required.

Code Snippet:

HTML
<a class=""btn btn-cstm-light "" data-dismiss=""modal"" aria-label=""Close"" onclick=""moengage.trackClick(); moengage.trackEvent('MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED',{survey_response: document.querySelector('input[name=customRadio]:checked').value},{},{},false,true); moengage.setUserAttribute('survey_response', document.querySelector('input[name=customRadio]:checked').value); moengage.dismissMessage();"">Share Feedback</a>
Step 2: Trigger an Event on User Response

When the user submits a response, trigger the event  ""MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED"". In the template's code, this is done in line 88. The event attribute ""survey_response"" which captures the user input from your feedback form is used for tracking the MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED event  You can customize the event and event attribute name as required. Once tracked, this event can be used to send data outside MoEngage or trigger follow-up campaigns as required.

Code Snippet:

HTML
<a href=""#"" class=""btn btn-cstm-light btn-cta"" onclick=""moengage.openRichLanding('https://www.moengage.com'); moengage.trackClick(1); moengage.dismissMessage()"">get started</a>
HTML
<a href=""#"" class=""btn btn-cstm-light btn-cta"" onclick=""moengage.openRichLanding('https://www.moengage.com/nativ/'); moengage.trackClick(2); moengage.dismissMessage()"">get started</a>

In the carousel template, when the user clicks on one element of the carousel, the user will be redirected to https://www.moengage.com, and when they click on the next, it will lead to an event being tracked. Similarly, you can define actions as listed in the JS Bridge section here.
The moengage.trackClick(2) function inside the code snippet above is responsible for tracking clicks. The argument inside the function (1), and (2) will help you differentiate between the clicks on different elements of the carousel.

Device Orientation

For mobile devices, the portrait mode is the most compatible with this template. Users will get a scroll option when this template is viewed in landscape mode. On tablets and TV, this template will render as expected on any orientation.

Common Elements in All HTML Templates
Code View Section

In the Code View section, you can do the following:

Edit the HTML code to alter the template as per your requirement.
Upload files to be used in the template. This feature allows you to add images, CSS, and JS files and embed them in your HTML. Refer to the Asset Uploader section to learn more.
Template Settings

In the Template Settings section, you can do the following:

Set the device orientation for the template. You get the following options:
Select the allowed device types in the Allowed Device Types section as shown below:

Click on Preview after making all the necessary changes to the template to preview the template in the allowed device orientation mode. If the allowed orientation is 'Both', you can view both the Portrait and Landscape previews. If only Portrait or Landscape is chosen, only the chosen device orientation will be shown in the preview.

Preparing HTML Templates

HTML In-apps are rendered on your mobile apps inside a full-screen web view and MoEngage SDK will render the HTML as it is without any operations on it.

When you prepare the HTML templates to display as In-App messages remember the following:

Use the Sample HTML Templates provided by MoEngage. You can either directly download and upload them on MoEngage or edit them as required. These sample templates also act as references when you want to go about building your own HTML templates from scratch.


The HTML Templates always occupy the entire screen on your mobile app. Even if the HTML of the template does not occupy the entire screen, there will be a transparent web view there which will restrict the user from interacting with your app. Due to this functionality, it is always recommended to put a transparent overlay behind your templates. This can be configured as the background of your HTML template.


All the interactions from the template need to be logged as data points in MoEngage either for calculating performance stats of your campaigns (like clicks) or as user data points like (events, user attributes - email, mobile number, rating, and so on), leverage the JavaScript Bridge for HTML In-Apps and use them inside your HTML templates.


On iOS, there are two pointers that need to be noted -
By default zoom, scaling will be enabled in web view. Disabling has to be done from HTML  using the meta tag.
On iOS devices with the notch, update the CSS to support the safe area, so that content does not overlap with the notch


For background images provided inside the HTML template as described in the image, MoEngage will not pre-fetch the URLs as these URLs are inside the template styles. Please do not use uploaded asset URLs for the background images. For such cases, an absolute URL is required which MoEngage SDK will download and render on runtime. For all other images, we pre-fetch the images so that when the In-app message is rendered, there is no buffer.

Components supported

Although HTML In-app templates support all HTML and CSS components, the following components would are some of the key highlights with which you would be able to derive a lot of value from the HTML In-app campaigns.

Element	Use-cases
Audio / Video	You can now play video or audio files from your In-App campaigns for conveying information to your users. These are especially helpful during the user onboarding process.
Image / GIF	Promote offers or content or products or services with your In-App campaigns and grab user attention with rich images.

Note: You won't be able to upload GIF files but you can add them to the template via absolute URLs. 
Input	You can capture user input like an email address or mobile number via your HTML In-app campaigns
Survey	Run surveys on your mobile apps via HTML In-app campaigns
Carousel	Show more than one offers or product or service in a single pop-up using a carousel-like interaction.
Custom template editor

With the custom template editor, you can create HTML templates using the following options:

Self-Handled
Zip Upload
Custom HTML Upload
ZIP File Upload

When you select this option from the template selection screen of In-App campaign creation, you can upload your HTML + Assets together as a single ZIP file.

Once you choose this option, a pop-up will open up where you can upload your template ZIP file 




When preparing your ZIP file, please ensure you follow the below steps:

Ensure that your .zip file is less than 5MB in size
Files present inside of the Zip should not contain *, /, \, &, ~, &quote; in their names
All images should be in JPG, JPEG, PNG, or SVG formats.
You won't be able to upload GIF files but you can add them to the template via absolute URLs. 
The relative path specified for images should match the zip folder structure including case sensitivity
Custom HTML Upload

When you select this option from the template selection screen of In-App campaign creation, you can directly paste your template's HTML on the MoEngage dashboard and upload assets as required. If you select this option, then you will be redirected to the code view editor, where you can paste the HTML code of your template.



 
Asset Uploader

While creating an In-app campaign with custom HTML templates, you can upload your own assets and link them to the HTML of your templates.

JavaScript Bridge

The JavaScript bridge is required to track actions from your HTML In-app message. Some of the actions include click tracking, message closing, and data tracking. Once you prepare the HTML template, you need to integrate the JS Methods in your template for the actions and stats to be tracked. For more information, refer to JavaScript methods that can be used with HTML In-app templates.

Fixing template errors

While creating an In-app campaign on MoEngage, you may see up to 3 different warnings as shown below -


The following table describes the warnings and the resolution

Error Message	Impact	Resolution

Sample Templates

The sample HTML templates are available in this article.

Other new features

With HTML In-apps, you can now leverage the following features additionally.

Show In-app messages in Landscape mode

If you need to show In-app campaigns in Landscape mode, you can now leverage the HTML In-app templates and go to Template Settings to configure this -

 

You need to upgrade your SDK Versions to 11.4.00 (Android) and 7.1.0 (iOS). The default selection for device orientation is Both which means that an HTML In-App campaign is displayed on both portrait and landscape mode by default.

Few pointers to note here:

If the In-App campaign is configured only for Portrait mode then the In-App message will be dismissed when the device rotates from Portrait to Landscape mode.
If the device is in Portrait mode and the In-App campaign is only configured for Landscape mode then the In-App campaign will not be shown in this case.
The selected device orientation will stay the same across different variations and platforms.
On Android, on device rotation, the In-App message is dismissed and re-rendered again.
Show In-app messages on Tablets or TV

If you need to show your In-App messages on Tablets and TVs then you can leverage the HTML In-app campaigns.

The default selection is only for Mobile so any additional devices that need to be targeted would have to be configured additionally during the campaign creation.

 

Copy the HTML code of the Native templates

** Before you copy the HTML code, please make sure that you have HTML in-apps enabled for your DB**

Ever wanted to modify the native in-app templates but were not able to? Now you can copy the HTML of the native template with the click of a button, edit it in the custom HTML editor and publish the campaign.

This is how you can do it - 

In Step 2 of the campaign creation, select the template that you want to edit. 
Above the preview of the template, click on ""Copy HTML"" to copy the HTML code of the selected template. 



As a next step, click on the kebab menu to change the template.



Select ""Custom HTML Upload"" from the Custom template editor tab



Delete all the existing code in the editor and paste the new code in the editor using cmd+v or ctrl+v


Now you can edit the code of the template and modify it according to your business objective. 



Few things to keep in mind while using this feature - 

Implementing click tracking will be necessary in this case, as it will not be included by default in the copied code. Read how to do it here. 
No actions configured in the native template will be copied here automatically. They will have to be implemented at your end from scratch. For example, here is how you can add code to navigate to another screen. 
You will also need to implement the close button. Here is how you can do it. 
Make sure that you also handle the interactions in the code using Javascript if there are any dynamic components in the template.
If you paste the HTML code of the nudge template into the editor, it will appear as an overlay pop-up upon publishing instead of being embedded within the app. 
Make sure that you test your campaigns in both landscape and portrait modes to avoid errors after publishing.

Configure In-App HTML Templates Based on Dark and Light Modes
Overview

This article explains how to automatically switch light and dark modes for any custom HTML In-app template. You can use this approach for any HTML structure, ensuring that you can adapt your own In-app message templates to respect the user's system color scheme preference.

To make your custom HTML template automatically switch between light and dark modes based on the user's system settings, you can use CSS media queries. This lightweight approach ensures your In-app message adapts seamlessly to the user’s preferences. The key CSS tools you’ll use are the prefers-color-scheme media query and the color-scheme property.

The prefers-color-scheme media query: This CSS feature detects whether the user’s system is set to light or dark mode. You can use the media query to apply different styles depending on the system setting to deliver a polished and user-friendly In-app message experience. The media query works in modern browsers and webviews, ensuring compatibility with In-app messages.
The color-scheme property: This property instructs the browser that your template supports both light and dark modes, which can improve how certain elements (like form controls) are rendered.
With these tools, your template will dynamically adjust its appearance based on the user’s system preference, improving usability and accessibility.
Steps to Implement
Step 1: Start with Your Custom HTML Template

Use your existing HTML code as the foundation. You don’t need separate files for light and dark modes. The CSS will handle the switching within a single template. For more information on In-app HTML templates, refer to HTML In-App Templates and Sample HTML In-app Templates.

Step 2: Structure Your CSS for Light and Dark Modes

Organize your CSS to define styles for both light and dark modes:

Define base styles: These are the default styles that apply when no specific color scheme is detected or when the user’s system is in the light mode. Typically, these will be your light mode styles. Include styles for all key elements in your template, such as backgrounds, text, buttons, and containers.
Add dark mode styles with media queries: To override or add styles specifically for dark mode, use the @media
    (prefers-color-scheme: dark) query. These styles will be activated when the user’s system is set to dark mode.

Here’s an example of how to structure your CSS: 

CSS
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	/* Base styles (default for light mode) */

	body {

	background-color: #ffffff; /* White background */

	color: #000000; /* Black text */

	}

	.container {

	background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Light gray container */

	}

	button {

	background-color: #007bff; /* Blue button */

	color: #ffffff; /* White text */

	}

	/* Dark mode styles */

	@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {

	body {

	background-color: #121212; /* Dark background */

	color: #ffffff; /* White text */

	}

	.container {

	background-color: #333333; /* Dark gray container */

	}

	button {

	background-color: #ffffff; /* White button */

	color: #000000; /* Black text */

	}

	}
Some Key Points

In the code above:

Base styles: These apply by default and should cover all elements in your template for the light mode.
Dark mode styles: The media query adjusts styles for the dark mode, ensuring a smooth transition when the user’s preference changes.
Flexibility: Adapt the class names (for example, container and button) and properties to match your template’s structure.
Step 3: Use the color-scheme Property

Add the color-scheme property to the root of your CSS to signal that your template supports both modes:

CSS
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	css

	:root {

	color-scheme: light dark;

	}

Doing so will:

Help the browser understand that your content is ready for both light and dark modes.
Automatically adjusts native elements (For example, form inputs, scrollbars) to match the user’s preference.

Include this at the top of your CSS file.

Step 4: Customize Styles for Your Template’s Elements

Since your HTML template is unique, identify the elements that need to adapt to the color scheme. Common elements of style include:

Backgrounds: Body, sections, modals, or other containers.
Text: Headings, paragraphs, links, or labels.
Interactive elements: Buttons, forms, or navigation items.
Overlays: Modal backdrops or pop-ups.

For each element, follow the steps below:

In the base styles (light mode), use colors that work well with a light background (for example, dark text on light backgrounds).
In the dark mode media query, adjust colors for dark backgrounds (for example, light text on dark backgrounds).

If your template uses a CSS framework (for example, Bootstrap), you may need to override framework-specific classes in the dark mode media query. For example:

CSS
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	css

	  /* Light mode default */

	  .bg-custom {

	  background-color: #e9ecef;

	  }

	  /* Dark mode styles */

	  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {

	  .bg-custom {

	  background-color: #444444;

	  }

	  }

Step 5. Link the CSS to Your HTML

Ensure your CSS is linked to your HTML file in the <head> section:

HTML
<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""path/to/your/custom.css"">

If your template already uses other stylesheets, place your custom CSS after them to allow your styles to take precedence.

Step 6. Test Your Implementation

Test your template in both modes to ensure it works as expected:

Light mode: Set your system to light mode and check that the base styles are applied correctly.

Dark mode: Switch to dark mode and verify that the media query styles override the base styles appropriately.

The base styles define a light theme.
The dark mode media query adjusts the styles for a dark theme.
Additional Considerations
Handling Images and Icons

If your template includes images or icons that don’t look good in both modes (for example, a dark icon on a dark background):

Provide alternative versions for each mode and swap them using CSS.
Use a CSS filter to adjust visibility.
CSS
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	  css

	  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {

	  .custom-icon {

	  filter: invert(1); /* Inverts the icon color */

	  }

	  }
Ensuring Accessibility

Check that your color choices provide sufficient contrast in both modes and verify readability with external tools.

Framework-Specific Adjustments

If your template uses a CSS framework, override any framework classes that don’t adapt automatically. Identify these classes in your HTML and adjust them in the dark mode media query as needed."

Self Handled In-App Template
Introduction

Self-Handled In-App Campaigns leverage the MoEngage In-App Nativ Campaigns and trigger a certain action inside your mobile apps.

You can leverage all capabilities of MoEngage Mobile In-App Campaigns like Segmentation, Event Triggers, Personalization, Delivery Controls and trigger your own app's In-App template or modify your app UI instead of showing a MoEngage In-App template.

Using Self Handled In-App Campaigns

At times, you may want to show your own In-App messaging templates to your user which are not supported by MoEngage In-App campaigns. To do this, you can select the self-handled campaigns in MoEngage and trigger your template when the user satisfies the campaign conditions. The campaign management and campaign performance stats will be maintained on MoEngage for your reference.

Personalization of Content

You can personalize the content of a Self Handled In-App campaign. In step 2 of campaign creation, on the Content tab, type @ in the content where you wish to personalize.

You can personalize the content using User Attributes, User Events, Product Sets, Content APIs and Content Blocks.

For more information, refer to

MoEngage Templating Language (JINJA)
Derived Events & Attributes
Product Sets
Content APIs 
Content Block

Do the following:

Type @ to personalize the content.
Click either Data personalization or Content Block.
Click the Data personalization tab and from the drop-down, select one of the following
User Attributes

Select one of the following as for alternate (Fallback) to the personalization:

No Fallback
Choose the option for personalized content. The option results in no alternates when the personalization does not work.
Do not send In-App
Choose the option where if the personalization does not work, In-App messages are not sent.
Replace Text
Type or paste the text used when the personalization does not work.
Product Sets
Content API
Modify the values of the parameters of the Content API.
Click the Content Block
Select the content block to be inserted
Click Insert only the content of the content block.

The content is disconnected from the content block
Any content update in the content block is not reflected in the inserted content.

Click Done.

App Personalization with Self Handled In-App Campaigns


At times, you may want to personalize your mobile app for a certain segment of users and also visualize how the users are reacting to this app personalization by tracking the Click Through Rate, Conversion Rate, and other performance trends.

With MoEngage Self-Handled In-App Campaigns you can do this.

A few examples of App Personalization are as below -

Personalize the background color of your app screen: Try out different background colors for your app screen to boost conversion.


Personalize the CTA color of your app screen: Experiment with different CTA colors to boost your click-through rates.


Personalize the products in your product carousel for each user: Show personalized products on your category page or home page to boost conversions.


Localize the text on your app for different user segments to boost signups: Show localized text on your signup page to boost the number of users who are completing the signup process.

Experiment 2 of the article describes how to set up these app personalization use-cases. You can also configure any experiment apart from these use-cases as required.

 

Setting up Self Handled Campaigns with In-App Nativ
library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Ensure that the MoEngage SDK for self-handled is enabled.

To use Self Handled Mobile In-App Campaigns in MoEngage, start creating an In-App campaign as you would normally do and select the self-handled template as described-

After selecting the self-handled In-App template, specify the text that you want to send to your app like below -

This is the exact payload that will reach your mobile app when a user qualifies to see this campaign.

After receiving the payload from MoEngage, you can consume it to show your template or personalize your app as required. 

Integration Steps

There are integration steps required to be able to use self-handled In-Apps and track the performance stats for your campaigns like impressions, clicks, and conversions. Follow the below integration steps to start using self handled In-App campaigns -

Android

iOS

These integration steps allow you to consume the data under a self-handled campaign on your mobile app and also pass on performance stats like impressions and clicks to MoEngage to visualize the performance of your campaigns.

Experiment 1: Personalize the background color of your app screen
Hypothesis

Changing the background color of your app will boost conversions by making the UI look more appealing to your users.

Campaign Creation

Start creating an In-App nativ campaign and select the self-handled template on step-2 of campaign creation.

Segmentation: Select the set of users for whom you want to change the background color of your app. For example -



Conversion Goals: Measure the performance of your campaigns by defining a conversion goal on step-3 of your campaign creation.

Self Handled Template Data

Your app would need to receive the exact color to update the background color. To send the exact color, you need to add the below text in self handled campaign data - 

{
""moe_element_type"": ""background_color"",
""moe_background_color"": ""#FBE192""
}

You can change the key names and values as required. This is just a sample.

Integration Steps

On your app, you need to consume this JSON and update the background color as available under the key ""moe_background_color"" as shown in the image reference in the next section.

Result

The app looks like the following image before and after you run the test.

 

Measuring the Results of Your Experiment
Click-Through Rate: You can measure the click-through rate from the MoEngage campaign analytics page as shown below to measure if changing the background color increased the number of clicks on this page.


Conversion Rate: You can measure how your experiment has performed by calculating the conversion rate of these users after the experiment was run and before the experiment was run.
Experiment 2: Personalize the CTA color of your app screen
Hypothesis

Changing the color of the main CTA on your sign-up screen will boost sign-ups (conversions) by making the CTA stand out on your app screen.

Campaign Creation

Start creating an In-App nativ campaign and select the self-handled template on step-2 of campaign creation.

Segmentation: Select the set of users for whom you want to change the background color of your app. For example:



Measure the performance of your campaigns by defining a conversion goal on the step-3 of your campaign creation -


Self Handled Template Data

Your app would need to receive the exact color to update the background color. To send the exact color, you need to add the below text in self handled campaign data - 

{
""moe_element_type"": ""button_color"",
""moe_button_color"": ""#753BC3""
}

You can change the key names and values as required. This is just a sample.

Integration Steps

After you receive this campaign from MoEngage, you need to read the key - ""moe_button_color"" and apply this color to the button on your app screen.

Gamification templates
Overview

In today's digital world, gamification has become an increasingly popular strategy for engaging website visitors and enhancing user experiences. One effective way to incorporate gamification into your app is through the use of gamification pop-ups. In this article, we will explore why you should use gamification pop-ups and how to configure them.

Why use gamification pop-ups?

Gamification pop-ups can provide a number of benefits for your app, including:

Increased engagement: Gamification pop-ups can make your app more engaging by providing visitors with a fun and interactive experience. This can encourage visitors to spend more time on your website, explore more pages, and ultimately increase their chances of converting.

Enhanced user experience: Gamification pop-ups can enhance the user experience by providing visitors with a unique and memorable experience that sets your app apart from competitors.

Improved lead generation: Gamification pop-ups can be used to incentivize visitors to provide their contact information, which can then be used for lead generation purposes.

Gamification pop-ups in MoEngage

There are two in-app gamification pop-ups available by default in MoEngage:

Spin the wheel 

A spin-the-wheel popup is a type of interactive pop-up that can be configured on a screen in the app when a user visits or takes a specific action. The popup displays a virtual wheel that the user can ""spin"" by clicking a button. The wheel then spins and stops on a randomly generated prize or offer, which the user can claim by following the instructions given in the popup.

Scratch card

The scratch card popup displays a virtual scratch card that the user can ""scratch"" by clicking or swiping on the card with their mouse or finger. The card then reveals a randomly generated prize or offer, which the user can claim by following the instructions given in the popup.




Using gamification pop-ups campaigns

Now that you understand the benefits of gamification pop-ups let's explore how to create a gamification campaign in your app.

Start a new in-app campaign.
Complete Step 1 of the campaign creation.
Click next.
Scroll down to HTML templates.
Select the 'Spin the Wheel' or 'Scratch card' template.
The template would open up in the code view.
Configure the code according to your use case, as shown below.
Schedule the campaign, set the delivery controls, and publish the campaign.

 

Configuring gamification pop-ups
Spin the wheel template
Change background image 
To change the background image of the template, uncomment the style tag from lines 12 to 14 in the code and add the path of your image. 





Change other images in the template, like the win icon or lose icon
The code has been commented in such a way that you would be able to find what to change where. To change images in the template, search for the <img> tag and replace the existing source with the source of your image.


Add or remove sectors in the wheel
The sectors of the wheel are created using the ""DATA"" variable in the code. You can add or remove sectors according to your use case. Make sure to have unique ids for all your sectors.





Modify sectors
You can modify each of the sectors by changing the value for each of the keys.
Key	Description
id	It is a unique number.
weightage	

More the weightage, the more probable it is for the user to receive that sector on spinning the wheel. 

Note: Weightage does not specify that a sector will be allotted only for a certain number of times for the users during the campaign duration.


 

For example, you set weightages as - 
Sector 1 - 50
Sector 2 - 30
Sector 3 - 15
Sector 4 - 5

 In this case, weightage does not mean that sector 4 will be allotted to only 5 users for the entire campaign duration. It means that for the user this pop-up is visible, the probability of them getting Sector 1 is higher (50%) than Sector 4 (5%). The user can still get sector 4 even though 5 users already have it. 


label	It is the text you want to show on the sector.
code	It is the coupon that you want to show once the user lands on that particular sector.
win	t should be marked as yes if you want to show the winning screen if the user gets this sector. If you want to show the losing screen on a particular sector, mark the win as no.
color	It is the color of every sector.
Scratch card template
Change background image 
To change the background image of the template, uncomment the style tag from lines 14 to 19 in the code and add the path of your image. 


Change other images in the template like the win icon or lose icon
The code has been commented in such a way that you would be easily able to find what to change where. To change images in the template, search for the <img> tag and replace the existing source with the source of your image. 


Add or remove scratch card rewards
The scratch card rewards are created using the ""DATA"" variable in the code. You can add or remove the rewards according to your use case. Make sure to have unique ids for all your rewards. 

Modify rewards
You can modify each of the rewards by changing the value for each of the keys.
Key	Description
id	It is a unique number.
weightage	

More the weightage, the more probable it is for the user to receive that sector on spinning the wheel. 

 

Note: Weightage does not specify that a sector will be allotted only for a certain number of times for the users during the campaign duration.


 

For example, you set weightages as - 
Sector 1 - 50
Sector 2 - 30
Sector 3 - 15
Sector 4 - 5

 In this case, weightage does not mean that sector 4 will be allotted to only 5 users for the entire campaign duration. It means that for the user this pop-up is visible, the probability of them getting Sector 1 is higher (50%) than Sector 4 (5%). The user can still get sector 4 even though 5 users already have it. 


label	It is the text you want to show on the sector.
code	It is the coupon that you want to show once the user lands on that particular sector.
win	t should be marked as yes if you want to show the winning screen if the user gets this sector. If you want to show the losing screen on a particular sector, mark the win as no.
Viewing campaign results

Clicks and data tracking has been added by default to the existing templates. If you add more buttons, make sure to add click tracking. To know more about tracking, refer to this document. 

You can view the results of your template by heading over to the Campaign info page after publishing the campaign. 



 

Coupon codes shown to the users are stored in the coupon_code attribute of the event - MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED. This data will not tell you how many coupon codes were used by the user since that would be stored on your app. You can only get an idea of what coupon codes were shown to your users from this data."

Prerequisites

Enable the revenue attribute in your conversion events to see the revenue information in campaign analytics.

You can define a revenue attribute in addition to your primary conversion goal. After this attribute is set, you can view the following metrics on the campaign analytics page, which will show you the exact revenue generated by your campaign. For more information, refer to Schedule and Goals. 

Total Campaign Revenue: This represents the total revenue generated through this campaign.
Average Order Value: This indicates the average revenue generated from conversion events in this campaign. Average Order Value = Total campaign revenue/Total conversion events.
Average Revenue Per Converted User. This represents the total revenue generated by each user who performed the conversion event. Average Revenue Per Converted User = Total campaign revenue/Total conversion.
Campaign Performance

This section helps you visualize how the campaign metrics have varied over time.

You can perform the following actions:

You can view the impressions, clicks, conversions, and conversion events for campaign performance. These are similar to the ones mentioned in the aggregate campaign statistics section above.
You can change the date range, attribution type, and platform from the header. The time scale is represented according to your app's time zone. 
You can also switch to the Table view to see the time series data in a tabular format.

You can use segmentation to segment the users who have received or clicked the In-app campaign by filtering the Mobile In-App Shown and Mobile In-App Clicked events, respectively.
Child Campaign Performance

The campaign performance section contains information about the performance of the parent campaign. The stats for the child campaigns are available in the Child campaign performance section. You can view the analytics of each child campaign by either clicking the arrow icon beside the Recurrence or by switching to the table view and clicking the Recurrence field in the table, as shown below.

The child campaign analytics and info page opens in a new tab and cannot be edited, paused, or duplicated. However, you can do the same from the parent campaign.

How Do Self-Handled In-Apps Work in React Native?

The self-handled in-app functionality in React Native ensures that new event listeners are configured only after any active callback is completed. This approach ensures that events are handled individually, maintaining the correct order and execution of callbacks. 

Here's how it works:

Single Invocation Scenario
Where the self-handled in-app method is called once in the app, the event listener captures and logs the payload a single time. The following are example snippets of the implementation:


Multiple Invocation Scenario
If the self-handled in-app method is called multiple times in quick succession, React Native's event-handling model ensures the listener still responds only once. For example:



This orderly event handling is crucial for keeping the application stable and predictable. By processing each self-handled in-app message one at a time, developers can ensure every message is managed properly, improving the overall user experience."

FAQs - In-App Messages
Why Do In-app Nudges and Regular In-apps Overlap?
Problem 

In-app nudges and regular In-apps overlap when they are published simultaneously.

Explanation
In-app nudges and regular In-apps cannot be simultaneously executed due to their distinct nature, as stated in the Delivery controls.

Since a global minimum delay does not apply to In-app nudges, they take priority, causing them to overlap with regular In-apps.
Therefore, overlapping between In-app nudges and regular In-apps is an expected outcome when running campaigns with nudges.
Solution

Perform the following steps:

Publish the In-app nudge and regular In-app campaign on two different screens.
Add a delay in one of the pop-ups to prevent them from appearing at the same time."

Why Does Dynamically Enabling or Disabling In-Apps Fail?
Problem

There is a standard default method for showing the In-app campaigns, but you cannot dynamically control their visibility based on custom logic.

Explanation

The custom logic that failed to hide the in-app messages dynamically involves initializing a Boolean value to true or false.

	#val isInAppEnable = trueif(isEnable) {showInApp()}val isInAppEnable = falseif(isEnable) {showInApp()} 
Solution

Perform one of the following steps:

Use event-based In-apps to show or hide in-app messages based on your custom events on specific screens.
Use contextual In-apps with specified screen names to toggle the visibility of in-app messages while working with multiple screens."

Why Do Users Receive In-app Messages Even After the Flow Has Stopped?
Problem

Even though the flow has stopped, users continue receiving In-app Messaging (In-app) campaigns created within it.

Explanation
The user receives In-app campaign notifications because the expiration date has not been reached.
The user continues to receive In-app pop-ups until the flow is retired.
Solution

To resolve the issue, the user must set up the exit criteria in the flows.

Why Does the Video Upload to the Nudge Type In-app Campaign Fail?
Problem

The ""Content upload failed"" error occurs when uploading a video to the Nudge type In-app Messaging campaign. 

Explanation

The “Content upload failed” error is caused by a file name exception, specifically when the file name contains dots.

Example

If the file name is UNLMTD_Slot Machine_25.02.2024.mp4, the dots in the name cause the upload to fail.

Solution
Log in to the dashboard, hover over to the left, and select +Create new > Campaign > In-app.
Go to step 2, Content > Start from scratch > Zip Upload, and upload a sample video file.
Remove the dots from the file name and then attempt to upload it again.

In-App Message 
FAQs - In-App Messages
Why Are Users Seeing an In-App Message Repeatedly?
What is the Issue?

Users are seeing your In-app messages multiple times, even after you have set the delivery controls condition to show only once.

When Can Such Scenarios Occur?
When a user has logged in with the same user profile on multiple devices and has performed the trigger criteria on both devices. 
If a user logs out and then logs back in to perform the In-app trigger condition. 
When you have an application that logs users out due to session expiry or inactivity and they log back in to use the app.
Why Does This Happen?

In-app message has been designed to show pop-up windows based on the device ID of the user. When a user logs out, the user is set to an anonymous user and the delivery controls of the device are refreshed. When the user logs back in, the campaign will be shown again on performing the trigger criteria because the old delivery controls were removed, and the count of maximum times the user can see the campaign was reset to 0.

What Is the Expected Behavior?

According to the design, when users log in with the same user ID from multiple devices or when the users manually log out and log back in again, they will see the campaign once more. This cannot be solved. MoEngage can avoid showing of campaign multiple times only when the logout is app-initiated and not user-initiated. 

How Can You Solve This Issue?

If the app logs out a user due to session expiry or inactivity, they will be shown the campaign again on login. To avoid this, your app must remove the call to MoEngage SDK whenever the user is logged out automatically. You can do so:

For Android, remove the following function from the auto-logout call. Do not call the logout function of MoEngage when you call logout from your end. 
Kotlin
Java
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	MoECoreHelper.logoutUser(context)
For IOS, remove the following function from the auto-logout call. Do not call the logout function of MoEngage when you call logout from your end.

FAQs - In-App Messages
Why Does a Test In-App Fail to Render on Devices (In-App V2)?
Problem

The testing of an In-app campaign fails in the last step to check how the In-app looks and how is the response.

Cause

This issue can occur due to one of the following reasons:

Custom redirection: When you send an In-app test campaign, a splash screen or blank activity will open, and then it will redirect to the main activity screen where it will show the In-app message. But due to this issue, the call made to the server to fetch the In-app message is dropping and hence users cannot see the campaign.
Activity name is missing: When you are testing the In-app message, it selects a random activity from the backend to show on the screen but if the activity is missing from there, MoEngage will not show the In-app message.
Key-Value pair: It is not similar to the one seen in Campaign Creation. It is picked up from the backend, sometimes while testing the In-app message. If the key-value pair is missing then also the in-app message will fail to show.
Activity instance is null: This means that if there is no screen, then also MoEngage will fail to show the In-app message.
Solution

You can create a test campaign targeting yourself or a group of test users."

Why Are In-App Campaign Impressions Zero?

If your In-app campaign was working properly while testing but after the campaign creation, it is showing zero impressions on the dashboard, it can occur due to one of the following reasons:

None of the customers are fulfilling your segmentation or targeting criteria.
Users whom you have targeted, might not have opened the app. In-app campaigns are shown only when the user opens the app after you create the campaign.
Time difference between campaign creation and expiry time is too less and none of the users have opened your app during that interval.
showInApp() is not called on the screen on which the campaign needs to be shown.
There are multiple campaigns created with the same trigger and segment filters but the priorities are different, so the campaign with the higher priority would be delivered to the user.
The campaign might not show up because of the global delay condition. 
While targeting an In-app campaign to be shown on a particular screen, you have not selected the right screen name.
In-app module is not integrated with the SDK
In case of a similar priority, campaigns with the latest updated timestamp would be delivered first to the user."

Steps to Create an OSM Campaign for TV

There are three steps to creating an OSM campaign, and they are:

Target users: Define the target audience for the campaign
Content: Define the content of the push notification to be sent
Schedule and Goals: Define the campaign's delivery schedule and goals
Step 1: Target Users

On the target users page, navigate to the Target Platforms section. Choose TV as a platform and fill in the rest of the details. If you want to know more about the various fields on this page, refer to Target Users.

 

info	

Information

You can not select TV as a platform along with Web or Mobile Web. You must only select TV to proceed further.

 

Step 2: Content

You will get redirected to the Template selection page. Select a template for TV from those that are available and click on Select Template to proceed to the editor. 

You can customize the templates with the help of the OSM editor. The editor allows you to edit the image, background, and text on the template. 

To know more about the editing options in the OSM editor, refer to OSM Editor. 

Editing Buttons for Focus System

Unlike touch interfaces, TV heavily relies on a focus state to draw the user's attention to the focused element. This serves as the starting point for navigation. The navigation on a TV is constraining as users can only use a remote control device.

While on Focus, the user can use the navigational button to move to other focusable elements or click OK (or a similar button depending on the OS) to take the action associated with the focused element.

With MoEngage's OSM editor, you can edit the buttons using the hover action. To edit the buttons:

Click on the button you wish to edit, which will open the editing options.



Select the Color button (the square button) in the editing options to access hover mode. 
This will open a pop-up where you can edit the text color, background color, border, and shadow of the button that you want to edit. 
Click on the Hover option to edit the button in focus mode. Ensure that the button looks different in focus mode as it helps with the navigation on TV.



After you have made the desired changes and edits, click on Next to proceed to Schedule and goals. 

info	

Information

You must not add or remove a button on the TV templates to make sure that the focus navigation continues to work as expected in the template.
The Display Settings section has been disabled for TV.

Once the template has been customized, test it using the Test campaign option and publish the campaign. For more information, refer to Create OSM Campaign.
Lead Gen Template Example 

Let's take the case of a newsletter subscription lead gen template. To create an OSM campaign with the newsletter subscription template, do the following:

Choose your target audience as desired in step 1.
Select the Newsletter Subscription Lead Gen Template.
Click on the email input text field.
Click on the  icon in the editor toolbar.
If you wish to capture the email id of the user (the default configuration for the input field in the template), skip to the next step. If you wish to capture other information from the user, select the information type you want to capture in the type option. For example, if you wish to capture the mobile number of the user, choose Tel in type.
The input field is marked as mandatory by default. You can mark the field as non-mandatory by tuning off the Required toggle.
To map the information entered by the user, select the Advanced tab and choose the user attribute in which the information entered by the user should be stored, as shown below.
To map custom attributes, do the following:
Click on the Subscribe button to get the editor toolbar.
Click on Styling to enter the custom attribute mapping.
Enter the custom attributes and their mapping in the Custom Attributes section. 

Note: This can be done in the UI as explained above, or you can add the mapping maually as explained in this step.

Once the template has been customized, enter the scheduling and delivery control options in step 3 of campaign creation and publish the campaign.

 

Once a user subscribes to the newsletter, you can track the same in their user profile. When a user clicks on Subscribe in the campaign, the following happens:

The MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED event is fired.
The user's inputs are stored in the user attribute mapped in the template. For example. if a user enters an email ID and clicks on subscribe, the email id gets stored in the Email user attribute and is available in the MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED event in the user profile of the user, as shown below.
Identifying Users who've submitted a response 

You can identify users who've performed the MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED event and filter them based on their responses to create segments and analyze the data in them by doing the following:

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard -> Segment -> Create Segment.
In the Filter Users by tab, select User Property and add the Has executed event as MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED.
Specify the time range for the event and add the campaign ID of your OSM campaign to see the number of users who've submitted a response to the campaign, as shown below.
You can create a campaign targetting this segment, analyze it or export its details, and run your own analysis on the segment data.
Typeform Survey
library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Create your Typeform survey and have the URL ready for it. This will be added to the template to fetch the survey.
If you are personalizing your Typeform URL with User Attributes, you need to pre-configure the hidden fields in your Typeform. For more information, refer to Using Hidden Fields in Typeform.

To create an OSM campaign with a Typeform survey gen template, do the following:

Type TypeForm survey in the template search box and choose the Typeform template.
Upon template selection, the template gets loaded in the OSM editor.
You can use the template as is or customize it as per your requirements. For more information, refer to customizing the template with the OSM Editor.
Click on the empty Typeform element in the template to get the editor toolbar.
Click the  icon and add the Typeform URL in the HTML editor that opens, as shown below.
In the HTML that is displayed, look for the following variables - ""data-url"" and ""src"". Add your Typeform URL along with query parameters in both of the fields. Make sure you use "" "" instead of ' ' as shown in the example below
<div data-id=""IFRAME"" id=""survey-frame"" class=""moe-element moe-container frame"" 
data-url=""https://typeformsales7.typeform.com/to/ZmQRUSIu?user_id={{UserAttribute['u_em']}}""
style=""z-index: 999999;"">
<div class=""widget__WidgetWrapper-sc-1rxjz1n-0 NwqzB"">
<div class=""widget__IframeWrapper-sc-1rxjz1n-2 cKLpKc"" style=""height: 400px; width: 600px;""><iframe
frameborder=""0"" height=""100%""
  id='typeform-iframe'
  src=""https://typeformsales7.typeform.com/to/ZmQRUSIu?user_id={{UserAttribute['u_em']}}""
  width=""100%"" allow=""camera; microphone; autoplay; encrypted-media; fullscreen;"" data-qa=""iframe""
  title=""typeform-embed"" style=""border: 0px;""></iframe></div>
</div>
</div>
You can personalize your survey URL with user attributes if you need to pass additional parameters for analysis. For example, if your Survey URL is  - https://typeformsales7.typeform.com/to/OLMOfS?user_id=xxxxx
, you can pass the unique user id (User Attribute - ID) and save this in the response by updating the URL to: https://typeformsales7.typeform.com/to/OLUWfS?customer_id={{UserAttribute['uid']}}
Note: For this to work, you would have to configure hidden fields on Typeform. Hidden Fields on Typeform allow you to pass additional parameters with the survey. 
Once the template has been customized, enter the scheduling and delivery control options in step 3 of campaign creation and publish the campaign."

OSM Templates (HTML Editor)

This document lists the information and guidelines to configure the different pre-defined on-site messaging templates in MoEngage and how to customize the HTML code of these templates in the code view.

Template Types

With MoEngage On-site Messaging Campaign, you can use different types of pre-defined templates as per your use case. The below table tells you about which template to select -

Template Type	Description
Simple Image Popup	Rendered in the center of the page over a translucent overlay and has only one widget - image. Use this when all the content is captured inside an image.

Images

We recommend our On-site Messaging users to upload images of high definition but not exceeding 1 or 2 MB in size. This is because before a message is shown on the device, the image within the message is downloaded from a CDN before being shown to the user. If a user is on a slower internet connection, it might take longer for the image to be downloaded and hence there will be a delay to show the message to this user.

Aspect Ratio of Images used in On-site Messaging Campaigns

Below are some recommended aspect ratios of images for each On-site Messaging Template. You can always introduce images of different dimensions in your on-site messaging templates and customize the styles and dimensions by opening the code view editor.

Template Name	Recommended Aspect Ratio
(width : height)
Simple Image Popup	Message re-sizes to fit images of most sizes. Recommended aspect ratios include 1:1, 2:3, 3:2 etc. and at least 400*400 in dimension so that the image does not distort. Popular dimensions are 600*600, 400*600, 600*400 pixels.
Center Popup with one button	Message re-sizes to fit images of most sizes. Recommended aspect ratios include 1:1, 2:3, 3:2 etc. and at least 450*450 in dimension so that the image does not distort. Popular dimensions are 600*600, 400*600, 600*400 pixels.
Sticky Banner with Header, Text and Button	There is a small icon image here and the recommended image resolution is about 5:3. Popular dimensions are 150*90 pixels, 250*150pixels
Lead Gen Template	You can add an image to the background of this template by going to Container -> Background -> Image. You can use images of dimension 400*500 pixels
Sticky Banner with Image	You can use images which are wider and occupy most of the desktop web width. Popular dimensions are 1024*80 and 1024*50 pixels. You must create separate campaigns for your desktop web and mobile web for this template.
Survey Popup	Only add a Typeform survey URL here.
Survey Sticky Banner	Only add a Typeform survey URL here.
Side Banner with Image	Use Images of aspect ratio 3:4 or 3:5 and at least 300*400 pixels so that the image does not distort on larger devices device. You must create separate campaigns for your desktop web and mobile web for this template.
Sticky Header with Text and Button	Not recommended to add an image here.
Side Banner with Image and Button	Use Images of aspect ratio 3:4 or 3:5 and at least 300*400 pixels so that the image does not distort on larger devices device. You must create separate campaigns for your desktop web and mobile web for this template.
Simple Sticky Header	Not recommended to add an image here.
Accepted image types

For On-site Messaging, you can upload .png, .jpeg, and .gif as images in any of the templates.

Responsiveness of Templates

If you are using large images of odd aspect ratio, it is recommended to create two different campaigns for desktop web and mobile web to ensure that nothing breaks when the templates are rendered on a desktop web browser and a mobile web browser.

Image Quality and Size

It is recommended to use high-resolution images so that they do not distort even on large screens. The higher the image size, the higher the chances of the image failing to download on a device with a flaky internet connection. Use images of less than 2MB in size to keep a good balance between image quality and time for download.

Background Color

Background color allows you to add a background to your on-site messages. It can also be removed to make your messages transparent. You can define a background color by navigating to Container -> Background and selecting one of the options here -

Solid - when you want to add a background color to your template
Transparent - when you want the message background to be transparent
Image - when you want to add an image to your template background. This is not generally recommended.

Edit in code view

You can now edit the HTML code of any of the existing MoEngage templates by clicking on the code view button as shown below -

Once you click on the code view button, you can edit the HTML, save it and see a preview for validation. Please note that if you replace the MoEngage template HTML completely, you will not be able to see the UI Editor for customizing your templates.

Please ensure that you are selecting the appropriate template as per your use case and then editing/adding your HTML code to the template.

If you are building your own HTML templates, please take note of the below points for tracking clicks and allowing your users to close the template - 

-For close button: Add this CSS class in your templates:   moe-inapp-close
Adding this class is very essential if you want the user to be able to close the template. MoEngage SDK will only close the template if this class is found.
Please note that the template will be closed only basis of the moe-inapp-close CSS class. Please do not use custom Javascript functions for closing the templates as it will result in inconsistent behavior.

- For tracking clicks : Add this CSS class in your template:  moe-inapp-click
Adding this class is very essential for MoEngage to be able to track clicks and attribute this to a particular campaign.

- For closing the template when the user clicks on a CTA or a link, add both the classes: moe-inapp-close and moe-inapp-click to the HTML template. This will ensure that the template is closed after the user is redirected to the URL.

Lead Gen Template

MoEngage's On-site Messaging (OSM) allows you to capture the leads from your website visitors. You could choose to capture the Email Id, Mobile Number, or any other preferences and save it in your MoEngage user profiles for re-targeting.

Popular Use-cases

Here are a few popular use cases for the Lead Gen Templates:

Capture the Email Address of website visitors and re-target them via Emails later.
Capture the Mobile Number of website visitors and re-target them with SMS later.
Capture the Name of the user to personalize the communication sent to the user.
Capture user interest related to the choice of brands, products, and so on.
Create Lead Gen Campaign

To create a Lead Gen Campaign in MoEngage, do the following:

Select the Lead Gen Template in the template selection page (second step of OSM Campaign Creation).



Follow the steps mentioned in the OSM campaign creation document. For more information, refer to Create OSM campaigns.
To capture the inputs shared by the user, you will have to map the input from the Lead Gen Template to user attributes.  In step two of campaign creation, click on the input widget of the template and then actions to configure the user attribute where this input will be saved.




If one out of the two input widgets is not required, you could also hide the input widget as shown below:

Where to see the captured data?

After the Lead Gen Template is shown to your users and they submit the form as shown below, the data is tracked and saved in MoEngage automatically.

 

You can see the saved input in the user profile, as shown below. MoEngage also tracks an event - MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED whenever a submission happens using a Lead Gen Template. This data is visible in the user profile, as shown below.

MoEngage captures the First Name and Email Address user attributes by default. You can add more input fields by changing the template content. 

Example - Phone Number

Add an <input> field for the phone number after the Email Address by using the following code.

JavaScript
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	<input

	                      placeholder=""Phone Number""

	                      class=""input-container moe-element""

	                      data-id=""INPUT3""

	                      id=""TEXT_INPUT_3""

	                      data-user=""u_mb""

	                  />

	<label class=""moe-error-text invisible"">This field is required</label>

To make phone numbers mandatory, add required in the Phone Number input field.

Example - Error Message

If you have marked a field as mandatory, please use the below JS to show an Error message when the form is submitted without that field.

JavaScript
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	<label class=""moe-error-text invisible> any error message </label>
Example - Custom Validation

The lead template validates for a valid email address, but if you want to add any other validation to the existing fields or the new form fields that you have added, please change the <input … /> tag of that field and add the following code:

JavaScript
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	data-input-validation-type=""any name""

Next, add the custom validation of the field in isFormDataValid() method. For example, below is the validation check for an Indian mobile number.

JavaScript
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	//Mobile number validation

	function isMobileNumberValid(mobile) { const mobileRegex = /^[789]\d{9}$/;return mobileRegex.test(mobile); }

Use the isMobileNumberValid() method inside isFormDataValid() for validating mobile numbers.

Testing your On-site Messaging Campaigns

We recommend testing your On-site Messaging (OSM) campaign during campaign creation to ensure it meets your expectations. There are a plethora of device/browser combinations available, and the actual display of the message on the website might differ from the dashboard preview. Use the Test Campaign feature to test the on-site messages on your devices.

Where to find the Test Campaign feature?

The Test Campaign feature is available in step 2 of campaign creation, as shown below.

How does it work?

The Test Campaign feature allows you to experience the look and feel of your on-site messages on your website. To receive an on-site message on your device before activating the campaign for your live users, do the following:

Navigate to the test campaign section during campaign creation and paste the URL where you want to see the campaign.


Ensure that the MoEngage SDK is integrated into the target URL for the test campaign to be shown.
When you click on the test campaign, a new tab will open in the same browser, and your on-site message will be shown there. This test message will only be shown on the same browser on which you click the Test Campaign button of the MoEngage dashboard and will not be visible to your other website visitors.
Test Campaigns are active for 30 seconds, and during this time, you will keep seeing this campaign on the same browser even after refreshing the page. This will not happen for your live campaigns.
Test Campaign for mobile web

To be able to Test Campaigns for mobile web, you can use any one of the below options:

Testing using chrome device mode
Testing on a dummy URL with a live campaign

To simulate using Chrome's device mode, do the following:

Open your website on your chrome browser and open developer options as shown below. 

Switch to mobile web view for your website as shown below. 

Note: This approach will only show you an approximation, and the results may only be accurate in some cases. For more information, refer to Chrome Device Mode."

Exit Intent Technology

MoEngage's Exit Intent Technology detects the activity of your website users and prompts a trigger when the user is about to leave your website. You can leverage this prompt for your desktop web and mobile web traffic in your On-Site Messaging(OSM) campaigns.

How do we detect exit intent?

We detect the exit intent of users on the desktop and mobile web, as described below:

Exit Intent on Desktop Web - On the desktop web, we detect the cursor's movement on the browser tab, and as soon as the cursor moves outside the browser tab, MoEngage SDK will trigger an exit intent campaign.
Exit Intent on Mobile Web - On the mobile website, we detect an exit intent based on one of the following conditions:
When the user taps on the back button or gestures to move to the previous page on the browser.
When the user tries to switch between tabs by double-clicking the browser or by clicking on the tab button of the browser.
On scrolling down by 50% and then scrolling up by 5% - This will display the browser's top bar from where a new tab can be opened. 
Use-cases for Exit Intent Campaigns
Capture the Email Id of users when they are about to leave the website.
Retain user interest by showing the best offers on your website on exit intent. Personalize these offers by creating segments and content for specific geographies.
Ask users for feedback when they are about to leave the website to get more insight into where you can improve.
Create OSM Campaigns with Exit Intent Trigger

To create OSM campaigns based on exit intent, do the following:

Navigate to +Create Campaign on the All Campaigns Page.
Select On-site from the list of inbound channels.
In Step-1 of campaign creation, select Trigger Action as Exit Intent, as shown below.

Add the required details for campaign creation and publish it. For more information, refer to create on-site messaging campaigns.

This article describes the anatomy of how a mobile In-App campaign and an On-Site Messaging (OSM) campaign are delivered to your user. Each section below describes the dependencies and configurations that affect the delivery of these messages.

The following common modules across Mobile In-App and OSM campaigns are important for the campaign delivery and rendering on the end user's device.

SDK Sync

The active mobile In-App and OSM campaigns are delivered to the SDK for rendering when the user opens the app. After a campaign is delivered to the SDK, it will be shown as soon as the trigger action is performed by the user provided the other campaign conditions such as display controls and delivery controls are fulfilled.

Segmentation

While creating a mobile In-App campaign or an OSM campaign, you can choose to target all users or specify filters to select the audience you want to target.

When you select All users:

These campaigns will be delivered to all users, even the ones who are opening your app for the first time.
When you select an option under Filter users by:

When the campaign starts at the scheduled time, the filter conditions are evaluated and the users who satisfy the filter conditions are evaluated by running the segmentation query. This list of users is maintained on the MoEngage side and when one of the users opens the app/website, the campaign is delivered to the SDK.
info	

Note for Segmented Campaigns

Campaign Segments are evaluated in real-time for user attribute segments. Segments that use user attributes, and events & event attributes within the last 30 days of data are also evaluated in real-time. (Know more)
Segments using events and event attribute data beyond 30 days are evaluated frequently for new users to move into your campaign segment list and start seeing the campaign. The frequency of segment evaluation can vary from 30 minutes to a few hours, based on the campaign type. The frequency is configurable.

 

Trigger Action

The Trigger Action is used to fetch the campaign payload including the template, personalized properties of the template and render the In-App or OSM on the app/website.

Trigger Actions for Mobile In-App Campaigns

The user can select one of the following trigger actions for creating Mobile In-App campaigns.

On app open: These campaigns are triggered immediately when the app or any screen is launched by the user.
On specific screen: Send the In-App message when the user navigates to the specified screen.
On custom event: These campaigns are triggered immediately when the custom event is tracked on the SDK. Please note that only the events which are tracked from the respective Android or iOS SDK can be used as trigger actions for the Mobile In-App campaigns.
Trigger Actions for OSM Campaigns

The user can select one of the following trigger actions for creating OSM campaigns:

On Page Load: These campaigns are triggered immediately on Page Load unless a value is provided for After Delay or After Scroll in which case the campaigns are triggered after the conditions are met.
On custom event: These campaigns are triggered immediately when the custom event is tracked on the SDK. Please note that only the events which are tracked on the web SDK can be used as trigger actions for OSM campaigns.
On Exit Intent: These campaigns are triggered when the user is about the leave the website. For more information on exit intent, please refer to this article.
info	

Note for Trigger Actions

For Trigger Actions, only the actions generated on the same device and tracked by the MoEngage SDK are supported. Events tracked from S2S or generated by MoEngage internally on the server side like App / Site Opened, Device Uninstall, Device ReInstall or User ReInstall are not supported.
The actual campaign template is fetched in real-time as soon as the trigger action is detected by the SDK. We do not wait for the event to be processed to fetch the campaign template from MoEngage servers to keep the rendering real-time.
In the case of multiple campaigns with the same trigger action, only 1 campaign is selected by the SDK to be shown on the mobile app or website.
Campaign Priority

When there are multiple campaigns that have the same trigger action, in this case, we will make use of the Campaign Priority. Only the campaign with the highest priority will be displayed each time the trigger action is executed.

In case two campaigns have the same trigger action and the same priority, the campaign which was recently created will be shown.

Delivery Controls

Delivery Controls are used to control your In-App and OSM from appearing too frequently on your app and website. We have the following delivery controls:

Maximum times to show message ever: This will restrict your campaign to be shown for a maximum number of times as defined during campaign creation.
Minimum delay between 2 messages on this campaign: This will prevent your campaign from being shown frequently if the user executes the trigger action multiple times within a short time window.
Ignore Global Delay between 2 On-site Messaging campaigns: Global Delay will prevent your user from seeing too many In-App/OSM campaigns within a specific time window. Check this to not consider global delay for this specific campaign.
Auto dismiss message after: This will dismiss the in-app messages after the defined auto-dismiss time so that it does not bother the user.
info	

Note for Delivery Controls

Delivery controls are applicable at a device level and hence for one user who has logged in with the same user unique id on two different devices, the delivery controls will be applied separately.
For User 1 who is logged in on an Android device and an iOS device, the mobile in-app campaign will be shown for 2 times on each device individually.
If the user logs out or clears the device cache, the delivery controls are reset and the user will be evaluated for the delivery controls from the beginning after this logout/cache clears.
Please note that for an OSM campaign, there is a default behavior that OSM campaigns do not show up on the same page more than once. The campaign will be shown on the next reload or on another page.

 

Campaign Scheduling and First-Time Sync

Once started, for the campaign to start getting displayed, the following are the dependencies:

After Segmentation, the campaign will only be delivered to the SDK when the user opens the app/website. 
Personalization
A campaign is personalized when the user executes the trigger action and selects a campaign for rendering by the SDK. Once done, the SDK fetches the campaign template from MoEngage. During this activity, we will send a personalized template to the SDK. For more information, refer to Personalize With Campaign Attributes.
In case of personalization failure, the campaign will not be rendered if no fallback is provided in the campaign. Any other campaign will not be attempted thereafter in case of personalization failure hence it is always a best practice to add fallbacks for personalized In-App/OSM messaging campaigns. For more information, refer to Common Personalization Errors and FAQs.
Connectivity
Internet Connectivity plays a crucial role in mobile In-App and OSM campaign rendering. Poor internet connectivity may delay the campaign rendering by delaying the template fetch from MoEngage, image download delays, or failures.
If the image download fails, the mobile in-app campaign will not be rendered at all on the mobile app.

Why Are Unique Conversions Higher Than the On-Site Message Shown Event?
Problem

Unique conversions are higher than the number of users who triggered the On-Site Message Shown event, even though the segmentation and funnel counts remain the same. This issue occurs in the OSM campaign analytics.


Explanation
The campaign's conversion count does not represent unique users.
If a user views the campaign multiple times (up to 30), each conversion following each view is counted as unique.
The displayed conversion metric reflects the total conversions made without distinguishing unique users."

FAQs - On-site Message
Why Does the New Editor of OSM Display an Error When Uploading Images?
Problem 

When trying to upload images in the OSM campaign's new editor, the following error occurs:
""File extension is not supported.""

Explanation
Social media apps add characters with a period (dot) to the beginning of image file names before uploading them.
MoEngage interprets any text after a dot as a file extension, which causes the error.
Solution

To fix this error, remove the dot from the file name.

Example
When additional characters are added at the start of the image file name, it appears as: ""Snapinsta.app_431485390_745691364337715_8350453286241390781_n_1080.jpg"".
After removing the dot from the file name, the resulting file must resemble:
“Snapinstaapp_431485390_745691364337715_8350453286241390781_n_1080.jpg“."

Why Is the Mobile Webpage Refreshed Repeatedly for OSM Users?
Problem

When the On-site Messaging (OSM) campaign starts, the mobile webpage is refreshed continuously. However, if the campaign is stopped or paused, the refresh stops.

Cause

The issue arises due to a mismatch between the campaign's expiry time and the countdown timer, causing the mobile webpage to be refreshed repeatedly.

Solution
Move the redirection URL from a <div> to a button to prevent immediate redirection when the OSM loads.
Ensure that the campaign expiry time and the countdown timer expiry time are exactly the same.

Why Do Users Receive OSM Campaigns Even After the Flow Has Stopped?
Problem 

Even though the flow has stopped, users continue receiving On-site Messaging (OSM) campaigns created within it.

Explanation
The user receives OSM campaign notifications because the expiration date has not been reached.
The user continues to receive OSM pop-ups until the flow is retired.
Solution

To resolve the issue, the user must set up the exit criteria in the flows.

Information

The expected logical behavior is as follows:

If a Flow is in the Stopped, Paused, or Completed status, the OSM delivery will be stopped.
If a Flow is in the Active or Retired status, the OSM delivery will continue."

Cards Overview

Cards are a unique and customizable engagement channel for delivering personalized Campaigns, offers, and recommendations that reside in the users' app inbox or news feed without interrupting their flow of work. You can use the MoEngage Cards Inbox or the Self-handled Cards to deliver the Card campaigns to your users on your application.

      MoEngage Cards Inbox                                                           Self-handled Cards


                       

info	

Note

The MoEngage Cards Inbox is different from the MoEngage Push Notification Center. Although both function as inboxes for content delivery, these delivery points may not be located in the same places. Cards are displayed within the Cards Inbox, while Push notifications appear in the Notification Inbox.

To learn more, see Push Notifications.

Benefits
Persistent messaging - Unlike other channels such as push notifications, SMS, or In-app notifications, a card, once delivered, remains a part of the user's app experience for a long time. With cards, users always have the option to go to the app and refer to the content at their convenience. This makes Cards a great candidate to pair with other channels as the go-to area for all communications from your brand.
No Opt-in required: Unlike other channels, since cards are a part of your app experience, they do not require any permission from users.
Easy segmentation, triggering, and personalization: Cards come with all the great personalization and segmentation capabilities MoEngage offers. This will allow you to reach the right users at the right time with the intended message.
Interaction data: Card analytics can be tracked in MoEngage.
Non-intrusive: Cards appear as a native part of the user's app experience and are non-disruptive. This increases user receptiveness, resulting in better engagement.

While both ensure important messages remain accessible, they serve different purposes and offer different levels of customization.

Cards 	Push Notification Center
	
Provides a persistent, rich media inbox within your app, ideal for delivering engaging content feeds, carousels, or widgets. It ensures important information remains accessible even after initial engagement.	Offers a history of push notifications, making important notifications visible even after they've been dismissed from the device's notification drawer. This acts as a central repository for user-specific alerts.

Displays structured, personalised messages within a message feed.
A card, once delivered, remains a part of the user’s app experience for a long time.
Available in two formats:
MoEngage Cards Inbox: Pre-built feed with basic customization.
Self-Handled Cards Inbox: Custom feed developed by your team using MoEngage Cards payloads.
	
Stores a history of delivered push notifications within the application.

Create a Card Campaign

The MoEngage Card campaign enables you to send out personalized Cards to your target audience. The campaign aims to create a personal connection with users and promote a specific product, service, or message that appears on the user's App Inbox or News Feed. For example, you can create a Card campaign to promote a new line of eco-friendly clothing, or gift Cards or coupons to users purchasing an item on your application.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Ensure you have a fundamental understanding of MoEngage Cards before learning how to create one by reading the article Overview - Cards.

Steps to Create a Card Campaign

Creating a Card campaign is a three-step process:

Step 1: Segmentation
Step 2: Create view
Step 3: Scheduling

Segmentation

You can segment users to define your target audience for the Card campaign as follows:

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard sidebar > click + Create new > Campaign > Inbound > click Cards.
OR
Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard sidebar and select Engage > Campaigns > click + Create campaign > Inbound > click Cards.

Enter the Campaign Name to manage and identify the campaign. The campaign name must have at least five characters, and the limit is 256.
Select campaign tags from the dropdown. You can select a maximum of five tags. For more information, refer to Campaign Tags.
Check the boxes of the platform that you want to target:
Android
iOS
Web
TV (Early Access)

 	

Early Access

You can only create Self Handled Cards for TV.
You cannot select TV as a platform along with Android, iOS, or Web. You must only select TV to proceed further.
Based on how you want the campaign to be triggered, you can select one of the following criteria:
One Time
Event Triggered
Periodic

A One Time Card Campaign enables you to send the Card to a specific user segment only once as soon as possible or at a scheduled date and time. 
You can check the Allow Future Qualifiers box if you want users to access the Cards after the scheduled time. For example, if the Card was scheduled to go live at 10 am on a particular day, users who visit your application at 11 am or anytime after the scheduled time will also be eligible for the Card. For more information, see Allow Future Qualifiers.

Allow Future Qualifiers (recommended) 

Allow Future Qualifiers checkbox in One-time campaigns, allows the campaign to include users who qualify the segment criteria at any time in the future.
The differences between a one-time campaign with and without the Allow Future Qualifiers are displayed in the following table:

 	Without Allow Future Qualifiers	With Allow Future Qualifiers
Use case	

For campaigns that have a non-changing set of recipients who already have a device (app/website) at the time of sending.

	

If you need to display cards to new or anonymous users who may enter the segment after launch or may add a device after launch


Audience
	Cards are sent only to those users who have an active device tracked in MoEngage and are part of the segment at the time of sending the campaign. If a user who qualifies for the segment adds a device later, they will not see the Card.	

Cards are sent to users who qualify for the segment condition at the time it is sent or who qualify for the segment condition at any time in the future.

For ""All users"" campaigns, the Cards are sent even to anonymous users in their first session.
For segmented campaigns, future users who qualify the segment criteria—even though they were not part of the segment at the time of sending the campaign—will see the Card from the second session onwards.

Note: For such campaigns, if a user receives a Card as an anonymous user, but is part of the exclusion criteria after logging in to the app, the user will still see the Card that was shown when they were anonymous.


Analytics
	MoEngage considers the sent count based on the number of users with active devices targeted at the time of sending the campaign.	MoEngage considers the sent count based on the number of unique users receiving the Card campaign when it is delivered to them.
Response time	Because there is no evaluation at the time of delivery, these campaigns are delivered to the app quickly on app open/fetch.	Because there is an eligibility evaluation at the time of delivery, it may take an additional 1 second to fetch Cards if the user has any Card with the Allow Future Qualifiers flag set to True.
Campaign expiry	The campaign expiry time starts from the time the campaign is delivered to the logged-in user.	

If a user receives the Card anonymously, the campaign expiry time starts from the anonymous delivery time. 

 

If a user receives the Card after logging in to the app, the campaign expiry time starts from the time the campaign is delivered to the logged-in user.


Global Control Group	Optional	Users in the Global control group are not excluded from campaigns with Allow future qualifiers.
Select All users in the Select Audience section to send the campaign to all the app users.



If you want to send the campaign to selected users, you can choose the Filter users by option. This option provides you with four different methods to segment the target audience for the particular campaign as follows:

Filter by User Property
Filter by User Behavior
Filter by User Affinity
Filter by Custom Segment

This filter option allows you to target the users based on user properties such as first seen, last seen, city, and so on.

 

Follow the steps below to use the User Property filter:




1.  Click the User property tab and then select the desired attribute in the drop-down list.





For example, numeric attributes can have filter conditions such as 'is equal to', 'is not equal to', 'is between', and so on, while string attributes have different filters.
To learn more, see Filters in Segmentation.




2.  Enter the filter value(s) to create the desired user segment.





You can add more than one filter to the user segment by clicking the + Nested Filter and using either AND or OR conditions.

Additionally, you can also perform the following actions:

Create Multiple Filters: You can create and combine multiple user property rules, user activity rules, and custom segment rules to create a complex user segment using this option.
Click + Filter.
Click AND or OR.
Select the attribute or event and define the filter conditions.
Exclude Users: Select this checkbox to exclude users from the Card campaign based on different conditions. 
info	

Note

 

When the Allow Future Qualifiers checkbox is selected for the one-time Card campaign, an anonymous user who is part of the Exclude users segment will still be able to view the Card on the application.

Reset Filters: Click this option to reset the segmentation filters.
Show Count: Click this button to display the total number of users present in the configured segment.

Global control group: The Global control group toggle is enabled by default to exclude the control group users from the campaign's target segment so that the campaign is accessible to the selected target audience.
For one-time Card campaigns, the Global control group remains disabled when the Allow Future Qualifiers functionality is selected, allowing end users who are not part of any control group to access the Cards even after the scheduled time. For more information, see Control Groups.

Campaign Audience Limit

This feature empowers you to control campaign reach and expenditure by capping the number of users who receive it based on engagement metrics like sends, impressions, and conversions. It allows you to set total, daily, or instance-level limits to campaigns. For more information, refer to Campaign Audience Limit.

Create view

Once you've decided your target users, you can define the content of the Card campaign to be sent by following the steps below:

Click the dropdown and select your Card category.

The dropdown displays the Card categories that you've configured for the Inbox during the SDK integration process. MoEngage recommends organizing content into up to five tabs, including the All tab, for an optimal user experience. For example, Announcements, Promotions, Updates, Others, and All. You can customize the number of tabs based on your specific needs.
The All category, by default, displays all your cards set up in the All page in an aggregated format. This is not a required selection in the Category dropdown.
Click the dropdown and select the required template.

MoEngage provides two types of Card templates as follows:
Basic Card - You can use the basic template to send a simple message that focuses primarily on text, such as informing customers about an offer that ends next weekend and includes information like ""50% off on summer apparel"" along with your logo for easy brand memory.
Illustration Card - You can use the illustration template if you want your message to be richer and more focused on an image or gif that provides further information about the upcoming deal coupled with concise text.
Manage the look and feel of your Card by configuring the various components of the Card as follows:
Select background color


To make your message more appealing, you might want to add a background color to your notification. You can either choose a color from the color picker or add a hex code.

 

Header


The Header represents the title or heading of the Card that you want to communicate with your users.

The text limit for the Header is 30 characters.

You can also use emojis in all the text fields.

Message


The Message represents a brief description of the Card that you want to deliver to your users.

The text limit for the Message is 115 characters. Depending on the width of the device, you can add up to three lines of text. On larger devices, more text will be visible, while on smaller ones, less text.


You can apply some basic formatting to your Message by changing it's style and color.

You can also use emojis in all the message fields. Use websites like Getemoji to copy and directly paste the emoji, anywhere in your header or message.
Image


Images enable visual effects on the Cards. Images can be uploaded to your Card with the following methods:


Basic Card	Illustration Card


You can upload an image as an icon or thumbnail.

Enter icon URL - You can enter the URL of the image stored in a third-party application.
Upload Image - You can upload an image from your local system.
	

You can upload an image or gif in landscape mode.

Enter media URL - You can enter the URL of the image stored in a third-party application.
Upload - You can upload an image from your local system.

 

Supported image formats are JPEG, PNG, and GIF.

The maximum allowed size is 10 MB for both images and animated images.

Card Action (Tap on Card would)
This feature examines if any part of the Card has been tapped excluding the CTA text and then performs the following actions depending on the platform the Card is configured to display on:

Platform	Actions
Android	
Navigate to a screen - This option redirects the user to a specified screen (selected from the drop-down). Optionally, multiple Key-Value pairs can be added to take the user to specific parts of the page with relevant results.
For instance, if you wish to offer discounts on Apple iPhone 11 Yellow, you need to specify the screen name as <product purchase screen> and send the key-value pairs (brand, Apple), (Model, iPhone 11), (Color, Yellow) so that you can display results relevant to the Card campaign.

 Deep-link - This option takes the user to a deep-linked URL inside the app.
Rich landing - This option takes the user to a mobile-optimized rich landing page (Web or Mobile Web)

Scheduling

Define the Card campaign's delivery schedule and goals as follows:

Under the Send Campaign section, select one of the following options to deliver the Card to your users:
As soon as possible
At a specific date and time
The delivery process behaves differently for different trigger criteria implied on the Card as follows:

arrow_drop_down
One Time
arrow_drop_down
Periodic
arrow_drop_down
Event Triggered
Under the Display Controls section, manage your Card display by configuring the following conditions:

Card Expiry
The Period to Display the Card
Maximum Time to Show the Card
Pin Card to the top

You can configure the Card expiry details using the following 3 ways:

 

a.  At a date and time: All the Cards will expire on this specific date irrespective of when different users received the Cards. After Card is sent, if a user has not opened the Inbox even once till this expiry date, then that user will never see this Card.

 

b.  Days after the user has seen the Card: You can define the number of days for which the Card would remain active in the Inbox after the user has seen a particular Card i.e. after the impression happened. The maximum limit for this field is 180 days.

 

c.  Days after the Card has been delivered to Inbox: You can define the number of days for which the Card would remain active in the Inbox after the Card has been delivered to the App Inbox. The maximum limit for this field is 180 days. 

 

For example: As per the scheduling criteria set above, the Card campaign runs between 6th July and 30th September. And, the Card expiry is set as 60 days after the Card is delivered to the user's Inbox.  Now, consider the scenario:

 

The Card is delivered to User 1 on 6th July. So, for User 1 this Card will remain active for 60 days from 6th July i.e. till 7th September, and expire on 8th September

 

The Card is delivered to User 2 on 15th August. So, for User 2 this Card will remain active for 60 days from 15th August i.e. till 15th October, and expire on 16th October.

 

info	

Note

 

The default value for Card expiry is 30 days after the Card is delivered to the user's Inbox.

This option gives you the flexibility to decide whether, during the time the Card is active, should the user be able to see the Card 24/7 or only during certain hours on the active days. By default, it will be set to ""Throughout the day""

Enable the Conversion Goal toggle to set your conversion goals for your Card campaign.
Conversion goals help you to track how your campaign helped you achieve your business metrics. You can choose any app event(for example, Product Purchased) as a conversion goal activity.
Let's assume that your conversion goal is to acquire customers to purchase an iPhone on your application. So, you enter the Goal name as iPhonePurchase and the Event name as Product Purchased. 


You can add attributes by clicking + New attribute associated with the event to specify your conversion goals. In this case, prod_name is the event attribute/property with the value iPhone which means that your application will log the users who have purchased the product with name iPhone on your application.

 Multiple Conversion Goals 

You can add up to five conversion goals by clicking the + New goal option. With multiple conversion goals, you can now track more than one business metric or can visualize a funnel for your user actions.

 

For example, you can use multiple conversion goals to check the following events for a Card campaign: 

How many users have viewed the product page?

How many of them added that product to the cart?

How many of them made a successful order?


Set Attribution Window 

We also allow you to set an attribution window which is the duration for which you want to attribute the conversion goals to a specific campaign. This duration is calculated from the time at which the user received the campaign. By default, it is set for 36 hours but you can set it to any duration lesser than 36 hours.




info	

Note

 

The conversion goals and their attribution window are optional fields. You can disable them anytime by switching off the toggle button next to conversion goals.

 

Click Launch to confirm your campaign creation. 

Upon successful campaign creation, you will be taken to the campaign info page where you can view the campaign performance stats and a brief campaign summary.

info	

Note

When the Card campaign is sent, it means the Card is ready to be delivered to the user. The Card will be delivered only when the user opens their app Inbox.

Ensure to publish the campaign for users to access it in their app inbox.

Overview

There may be scenarios where you want to change the message in the Card campaign or target a different group of users to optimize your Card usage. In such cases, you can edit a previously created Card campaign without having to create a new one from scratch. Depending on the campaign delivery type and status, the editable fields may vary.

We recommend that you get acquainted with the Create a Card Campaign process and the types of Card campaigns before proceeding.

Navigation

To edit a campaign:

Navigate to the MoEngage dashboard and then click Engage in the left menu bar.
Click Campaigns to enter the All Campaigns page.
Once you've searched for the desired campaign, click the verticle ellipsis in the Actions column and then click Edit.

You can view the Edit option for all types of Cards (One Time, Event Triggered, and Periodic) that fit into the following categories:

Active (published) Cards that have been sent or scheduled.
Draft Cards that have not been published.
Editing a Card Campaign

You can edit various fields in the Card campaign depending on the campaign's delivery type and status.

One Time

For instance, you may want to launch a promotion campaign for users who added items to their carts for purchase within a specified period. Assume that you want to postpone sending out the campaign for some reason without losing track of the users who meet the segmentation criteria on the promotion Card. In such cases, you can hide the Card from users while it's still active by temporarily disabling the Show card toggle button. Similarly, you can toggle the Show card button on to resume sending out the promotion.

info	

Information

When you disable the toggle button, the Cards remain hidden from the Moengage Cards Inbox as well as the Self-handled Cards Inbox.

How does the Show card toggle work?
When Show Card is disabled: The Card will be temporarily hidden and not be displayed in the app inbox. The Card will remain with the status Hidden.
When Show Card is enabled: The Card will be delivered the next time the user opens their app Inbox.

Once a campaign's show/hide status is changed, it will be reflected in the next fetch based on the Cards UI type and its sync method.

The different campaign states and the Show/Hide behavior are explained in more detail below:

On Trigger Event
Campaign status	Campaign type	Show/Hide logic

Resumed	

Periodic parent,

Event-triggered and One-time with Allow future qualifiers
 

	

When the campaign is resumed, Show card will be turned ON.

You can switch it OFF anytime.


Stopped	One-time without Allow future qualifiers	

As soon as the campaign is stopped, Show card will be turned OFF. 

You can switch it ON anytime.


Archived	Periodic parent, Periodic Flow, One-time, and Event-triggered	

As soon as the campaign is archived, Show card will be turned OFF. 

You will not be able to turn it back on in the archived state. However, when you unarchive, the Show card will be turned ON.

info	

Note

The campaign can only be resumed once it's paused.
A stopped campaign cannot be made active again.
The show/hide status applies to both, the users for whom the Card has already been delivered and the new users who will qualify for the campaign.

For periodic cards, the show/hide status of the periodic parent campaign applies to all current and future periodic child cards."

Card campaigns provide important information regarding how the campaign performed in terms of impressions, clicks, and conversions. This information can help you to improve the performance of your business metrics and bring more value to your business. 

Accessing the Card Info and Analytics Page

Upon successful creation of a Card campaign, you will be redirected to the Campaign Info page. An alternate method to access the Campaign Info page is as follows:

Navigate to the MoEngage dashboard and click Engage in the left panel.
Select Campaigns to enter the All campaigns page.
Click the Select channel dropdown and then select Cards.
Select the Card you want to view the analytics for.
The Campaign Info page will display the following information:
Card Details
Card Analytics
Card Summary
Card Details

This section gives you an overview of the Card details as follows:

Card name
The time when the Card was created.
The user who created the Card campaign.
Card Tags
Card ID
Option to edit/duplicate/pause the Card campaign.
Option to show/hide the Card.
Card Analytics

The following metrics are displayed to assess how the Card has performed:

Total Sent
Unique Sent
Unique Delivered
Impressions
Click
Conversions
Total Sent is tracked when the MoEngage server successfully sends the Card campaign to the user and the user may/may not have opened the App Inbox. For an event-triggered campaign, every trigger adds to this count.

Points to be noted:

All the above except Total Sent are unique counts.
These unique counts are maintained for 72 hours.
For example, if the user opens the Inbox 5 times a day and a Card gets delivered every time, then the Delivered count will not be 5. The same logic applies to Impressions, Clicks, and Conversions. Despite the number of times a user views or clicks a Card or performs the conversion event, these numbers will be tracked only once in the 72-hour window
Let us say, after a week (post 72-hour window), the same Card gets delivered to the user's Inbox. In such cases, the Delivered count will be incremented by 1, and so on. 
These counts are combined for both Android and iOS.
info	

Information

If you have configured the Card dismiss option during SDK integration, the user can also dismiss a Card from the Inbox with a long press on the Card. Upon long press, users will get an option to delete/dismiss the Card. If the user performs this option for a Card, that Card will not be delivered to the same user again.

Card Summary

A summary of the Card campaign is shown in this section to help you understand the users you targeted, the message you included in the Card, the time you sent the Card, the platforms you chose to deliver your Card, Expiry time set for the Card, and additional data. 

It also allows you to check the message preview on all the platforms (Android, iOS, and web). In the preview section, you can hover over the Card or the CTA to see the action that you configured for this Card.

Under the Trigger Criteria section, you can see the type of campaign. For One time campaigns, you can see the value of the Allow Future Qualifiers setting.

Why Did the Payload for Card Campaigns Fail to Be Fetched?
Problem

The payload for Card campaigns failed to be fetched.

Explanation

For the payload to be fetched:

The card campaigns must be active.
The campaigns must be sent out.
The Show Card toggle must be turned on.
Example
In the following example, there are two Card campaigns: one is active, and the other is paused.
The sent and delivered counts for the active campaign are 0 because the campaign is not sent to anyone.
You can fetch the payload only if the Card campaign is sent and the Show Card toggle is turned on."

FAQs - Cards
How Are Cards Synced to SDK?

MoEngage Cards are synced to the SDK through the following process:

When the app initializes the MoEngage SDK, it connects with the MoEngage server.
The SDK sends a network request to the MoEngage server to fetch the latest cards.
The server responds with a payload containing the card data, which includes the content and metadata.
The SDK stores the fetched card data locally on the device.
The app then uses this locally stored data to display the cards to the user. The SDK may repeat this process to update the card data whenever the app is opened, or certain triggers occur (like app resumes or specific events).

This syncing mechanism ensures the app has the most recent card content in the inbox."

FAQs - Cards
Why Are Cards Getting Auto-Duplicated While Editing?
Problem

Cards are getting auto-duplicated while editing Card campaigns.

Explanation

This problem can occur when you configure a periodic campaign to expire each card in a specific number of days after a user has seen it. As a result, a new child card campaign appears each day, while the previous cards remain for the same number of days.

Solution

To avoid duplication of cards:

While defining the Card campaign's delivery schedule and goals, under the Display Controls section, ensure that the Day(s) after user has seen the card option under Card expiry is configured to 1.
In the following example, the option is set to 100, which must be set to 1."

FAQs - Cards
Why Are Cards Not Removed Even After the Campaign Expiry?
Problem

Cards are retained even after the campaign expiry. They should ideally be removed after the campaign expiry.

Solution

The default value for card expiry is 30 days after the card is delivered to the user's inbox. To remove cards before 30 days, you can configure the card expiry details using the following ways:

At a date and time. All cards will expire on this specific date, regardless of when different users received them. After a card is sent, if a user has not opened the inbox even once until this expiry date, that user will never see this card.
Days after the user has seen the card. You can define the number of days for which the card will remain active in the inbox after the user sees a particular card, that is, after the impression happened. The maximum limit for this field is 180 days.
Days after the card has been delivered to inbox. You can define the number of days for which the card will remain active in the inbox after the card is delivered to the app inbox. The maximum limit for this field is 180 days.

The sent count for Cards is drastically low compared to Push.

Explanation

The following table shows the difference in the sent count between Cards and Push:

Cards Sent Count	Push Sent Count
Calculated based on app/site opens. Card sync and delivery events occur only when the user opens the app.	Calculated based on push reachability.

As card delivery depends on the user opening the app, the sent count for cards is lower than the sent count for push notifications."

Why Are Card Campaigns Delivered After the Expiration Time?
Explanation
A Card campaign remains visible in the inbox the day after it is delivered, regardless of a 1-day expiry date.
The card is expected to expire at midnight on the same day it is received or 24 hours after its initial sending time.

The following screenshot shows Card expiry settings:

Example
If you send a Card campaign on May 7, 2024, at 12:15:30 and it is delivered at 12:35:44 on the same day, you might expect it to expire on May 8, 2024, at 12:15:30. 
However, in MoEngage, it will expire on May 8, 2024, at 12:35:44.

FAQs - Cards
How to Test Cards on Your App

This article explains when cards are synced with the MoEngage SDK and how the SDK interacts with the MoEngage servers to fetch the cards.

When Are Cards Available for a User?

After you create and publish a Card campaign, MoEngage server stores the card for each individual in the segmentation. After the campaign is sent, you can confirm that by that time, all the users should have the cards. Now, it's time to see the card on the app.

When Does SDK Sync Cards from the Server?

MoEngage SDK fetches the cards information for a user in the following scenarios:

When a user opens the app after it's killed (force stopped), the MoEngage SDK checks with the server to see any cards in the user's Inbox. 
When a user opens the app from the background, SDK will sync the cards only if 45 minutes have passed from the last sync.
If the user opens the cards inbox, the SDK will sync the cards only if 15 minutes have passed from the last sync.
If the user does a pull gesture to sync the cards, the SDK will sync the cards only if 5 seconds have passed from the last sync.

You can raise a support ticket to configure different values for the syncs.

When you have installed the app for the first time, the cards are usually fetched on the app open for an anonymous user. When you open the card inbox immediately after you log in, you will see the cards for anonymous user rather than for logged-in user. To see the cards for logged-in users, we recommend killing (force stopping) the app after you log in and opening the app again so that the cards are synced for the right user.
Another way to test the cards easily is to create a card campaign targeted to your user after you log in to the app. Add the segmentation criteria to select your customer ID."

FAQs - Cards
Why Is the Delivery of Cards Delayed?
Problem

The cards are not delivered right after the campaign is published.

Explanation
When you publish a Card campaign and the user opens the app, the MoEngage SDK sends the Card campaign data to the user's device.
The SDK checks the eligibility of all Card campaigns for that device and posts the eligible ones.
If the user performs the App/Site open action later than the campaign launch, the card may not be received in time.
After the user performs the App/Site open action, the card is delivered within 2-3 minutes.

In the following example, the user received the card after a delay because the App/Site open action wasn't performed earlier. The activity info shows that the card was delivered within 2-3 minutes after the App/Site open action was completed."

FAQs - Cards
Why Do I Receive Cards Even After the Card Campaign Is Paused in MoEngage?
Problem

Cards are still received even after the Card campaign is paused in MoEngage.

Explanation

This issue occurs because of the Show Card toggle. If you turn this toggle on, the cards will continue to be displayed to users even after the campaign is paused. Turning the Show Card toggle off hides the cards.

The Show Card toggle functions as follows:

When the toggle is turned off: The card is temporarily hidden and is not displayed in the app's inbox. The card remains in the status Hidden.
When the toggle is turned on: The card is delivered the next time the user opens their app inbox.

Once a campaign's show/hide status is changed, it will be reflected in the next fetch based on the sync method.

Solution

Understanding the different campaign statuses and the corresponding behavior of the Show/Hide logic can help manage the display of cards: 


On Trigger Event
Campaign Status	Campaign Type	Show/Hide Logic
Sent	One-time without Allow future qualifiers	

The Show card toggle is turned on by default.

You can disable it anytime.


Active	

Event-triggered

	

The Show card toggle is turned on by default.

You can disable it anytime.


Paused	Event-triggered and One-time with Allow future qualifiers	

When the campaign is paused, the Show card toggle is turned off.

You can turn it on anytime.


Resumed	Event-triggered and One-time with Allow future qualifiers
 	

When the campaign is resumed, the Show card toggle is turned on.

You can turn it off anytime.


Stopped	One-time without Allow future qualifiers	

As soon as the campaign is stopped, the Show card toggle is turned off. 

You can turn it on anytime.


Archived	One-time and Event-triggered	

As soon as the campaign is archived, the Show card toggle is turned off. 

You cannot turn it on in an archived state. However, when you unarchive the campaign, the Show card toggle is turned on.

 

info	

Note

The Show card toggle is not supported for periodic and event-triggered delivery types.
When a campaign is paused, you can only resume it.
You cannot make a stopped campaign active again.
Show Card applies to the users for whom the card is already delivered and to the new users who will qualify for the campaign.

Campaigns and Channels 
Cards 
FAQs - Cards
When Does the MoEngage SDK Sync Card Data?
Timing of Sync
The MoEngage SDK automatically hits the API every 45 minutes to fetch newly published cards.
The first API call occurs at app launch, followed by subsequent calls every 45 minutes.
When you open the MoEngage-provided UI, cards stored in local storage are displayed.
To manually refresh the content, refresh the screen, and the API will be triggered within 5 seconds to fetch the latest cards.
For Self-Handled Cards: 
getCards() retrieves cards from local storage, updated based on the API hit every 45 minutes. This may result in a delay of up to 45 minutes before newly fetched cards appear.
fetchCards() directly triggers an API call to retrieve the latest cards from the server and update local storage. This function can only be used if at least 5 minutes have passed since the last API call. If used before the 5-minute window, it retrieves cards only from local storage. In most cases, fetchCards() is a quicker option for getting up-to-date content.
Sent Tracking
The Sent status is tracked when the MoEngage server successfully sends the Card Campaign to the user, regardless of whether the user opens the app inbox."

FAQs - Cards
Why Is There a Discrepancy in the Cards Sent and Impressions Count in Campaign Analytics and Segmentation and Analytics?
Problem

There is a discrepancy in the cards sent and impressions count in campaign analytics and segmentation and analytics.

Explanation

The difference in the cards sent and impressions count between campaign analytics and segmentation is expected.

Campaign Analytics shows the event count for impressions, which can include multiple impressions from the same user.
Segmentation provides a unique user count, which can't be directly compared to event counts.

Additionally, a high number of sends might occur if the Max Times To Show setting is set to none and the card isn't pinned, leading to multiple sends being recorded. This behavior is normal.

Segmentation Counts

The Create Segments page always provides a unique users count.

Analytics Counts

Analyze section pages - Behavior, Funnel, Retention, and so on pages provide two different kinds of counts.

Total event count. This is the count of the user action or event. The total event count is available for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly granularity.
Unique user count. This is the count of distinctive or individual users performing the events. A user can perform a specific event multiple times. Unique user count is available at hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly granularity.

Campaign Counts

Impressions. This represents the number of user devices that received the cards sent by the marketer. It can also be seen as the total event count of impressions.
Clicks. This represents the total number of cards clicked by the users after the notification is delivered. It can also be seen as the total event count of clicks.
Conversion Events. This represents the total number of primary conversion goal events that occurred within the attribution period from the time the user received the cards.
Conversions.
For campaigns with only one recurrence, conversion represents unique users who have accomplished the primary conversion goal event at least once within the attribution period.
For campaigns having multiple recurrences, conversion represents unique users who have accomplished the primary conversion goal event at least once within the attribution period for each recurrence. For example, If a user receives one campaign instance on day X and another on day Y and converts once on both days, the conversions will be counted as two.

For more information, refer to Different count in Analytics, Segmentation, Campaigns stats & Flows."

FAQs - Cards
Why Is Card Data Not Getting Populated Based on the Entered Key Value?
Problem

Card data is not getting populated based on the entered key value.

Explanation

When using the Navigate to screen option in the Card Action (Tap on Card would) feature, ensure that you select the option, insert the link, and add the key-value pairs for the card data to be populated.

Card Action (Tap on Card would) Feature 
Navigate to a screen. This option redirects the user to a specific screen. On Android, select the screen from a drop-down menu, while on iOS, manually enter the link to the screen. Then, you can add multiple key-value pairs to direct the user to specific parts of the page with relevant results.
For instance, if you wish to offer discounts on Apple iPhone 11 Yellow, you must specify the screen name as <product purchase screen> and send the key-value pairs (brand, Apple), (Model, iPhone 11), (Color, Yellow) so that you can display results relevant to the Card campaign.
Deep-link. This option directs the user to a deep-linked URL inside the app.
Rich landing. This option directs the user to a mobile-optimized rich landing page (Web or Mobile Web).

You can use key-value pairs to add additional information to the deep linking or rich landing URLs.

Campaigns and Channels 
Cards 
FAQs - Cards
Why Is the Impression Rate Low in Card Campaigns?
Problem

The impression rate is low in Card campaigns.

Explanation

The impression rate in Card campaigns is tracked only when the user views a card in the inbox.

For a new card, an impression is tracked as soon as the Card is loaded when the user opens the inbox.
For older cards below the new ones, the impression is tracked only when the user scrolls down to them.
For self-handled cards, the delivery, display, and click impressions can be tracked by calling the cardDelivered() API, cardShown() API, and cardClicked() API if impression tracking is implemented.
warning	

Warning

The impression for a particular card is tracked once for each session, regardless of how many times the user scrolls to it.
In rare cases, you might observe two to three extra impressions. This occurs because of Android limitations, where the system creates extra rows for the cards that must be shown immediately if the user scrolls.

Introduction
Overview

WhatsApp is one of the most popular global mobile messenger apps worldwide, with approximately 2 billion active users monthly, outranking Facebook Messenger at 1.3 billion and WeChat at 1.2 billion users. An average WhatsApp user spends more than 30 minutes per day on WhatsApp, which results in WhatsApp messages having very high interaction/engagement rates. 

WhatsApp Business allows businesses to interact with users using WhatsApp Messaging. Businesses must adhere to guidelines laid out by Facebook. For more information, WhatsApp Business Platform.

MoEngage's WhatsApp Capabilities

MoEngage supports business-initiated messages (also known as templated messages). Business-initiated messages are sent to users who have opted-in. The WhatsApp Service Provider should have approved the template before you can use them for sending messages. With MoEngage, you can send One time Scheduled, Periodic, and Event-Triggered messages to their end-users who have opted-in for WhatsApp Messages.

Getting Started with WhatsApp
Prerequisites

MoEngage supports sending WhatsApp messages using WhatsApp Service Providers or WhatsApp Business Solution Providers (BSP).

The following are the prerequisites to sending a WhatsApp Message:

Create an account with the supported BSPs
Get WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) approved
Get a business phone number
Create an account

To send WhatsApp messages via MoEngage, you must have a BSP account. If you do not have an existing BSP account, contact your MoEngage account manager or the MoEngage Support team.

To contact the MoEngage Support team, you can raise a ticket through the Support Web Form within the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer here.
 

Get WABA Approved
info	

Information

Get support from your BSP to get the WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) approved.

WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) lets businesses communicate directly with their customers via APIs (used by BSPs and MoEngage). The first step is to create a business account and submit it to Facebook for approval. For more information, refer to Getting Started.

Get a Phone Number

All WhatsApp Business Platform accounts rely on a valid phone number. To send messages, you need to register the phone number you want to use. For more information about how to pick a phone number and add it to your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA), refer to Phone Number.

Your business must use a valid phone number that meets the following criteria:

Has a country and area code, such as landline and cell numbers
Is owned by you
Is able to receive voice calls or SMS
Is not a shortcode
Whitelisting/Approval of Templates
info	

Information

Get support from your BSP to get the templates approved or whitelisted.

WhatsApp message templates allow businesses to use pre-created and pre-approved templates to send structured messages to customers who have opted in to receive notifications. Messages can include appointment reminders, shipping information, issue resolution, or payment updates. For more information, refer to the List of categories supported by WhatsApp.

 

 

Businesses need to submit templates to WhatsApp directly or via WhatsApp Service Provider or BSP (For example, Infobip, Gupshup, Twilio, Yellow.ai, and so on) for review before they can use the templates. WhatsApp reviews Message templates to ensure they do not violate WhatsApp policies. You can submit templates in two ways:


Create message templates in the WhatsApp Manager, which is part of your WhatsApp Account in the Facebook Business Manager. Once approved, your business will have its own namespace where the message templates reside.
Create and submit message templates on the dashboard of the WhatsApp Service Provider/BSP for approval.  Contact your WhatsApp Service Provider if you need more information or help.
Update User Opt-in Data

WhatsApp messages are recommended to be sent only to users who have opted-in to receive WhatsApp messages from your brand. The opt-in data should be updated to MoEngage and the BSP.

Updating Opt-in preferences in MoEngage

MoEngage provides a standard attribute called WhatsApp Subscription Status (moe_wa_subscription), where you can update your user's opt-in preferences.

You can do it in either of the following ways :

User Import/Update feature that MoEngage provides under Segment->Import Users on the MoEngage Dashboard. The attribute that needs to be updated is WhatsApp Subscription Status. For more information, refer to import user data.
User Update APIs to send it directly from your Apps or Backend systems to MoEngage. The attribute you should update using the API is moe_wa_subscription.
For more information, refer to the API Documentation.

The expected values for the moe_wa_subscription field are described in the table below.

Status	Description
TRUE	You have received consent from users to receive WhatsApp notifications.
FALSE	You have received the confirmation that the users do not wish to receive WhatsApp notifications.
EMPTY	You have yet to receive information from the user about whether they wish to receive WhatsApp notifications.
info	

Note

MoEngage sends the notification to all users, excluding those who have opted out of receiving WhatsApp messages.

You must:

Update the rejected template in the vendor portal and get the approval from Meta.
Update the template in MoEngage with new content or Delete the template in MoEngage and sync again.

Suspended	

After the initial sync of templates from the vendor portal to MoEngage, during subsequent sync:

If the content of a template on the vendor portal and MoEngage is same, we will update only the status. For example, a Manually approved template can move to Approved or an Approved template can move to Rejected.
If you have updated the content of a template on the vendor portal, we will mark it as Suspended because there is a difference of content between MoEngage and the vendor.
	

Click the ellipses icon  and select View usage. The Active campaigns pop-up is displayed showing the campaigns created using this template.

If the template is not used in any campaign, delete the template in MoEngage and click Sync template again. MoEngage retrieves the latest content for it.

To verify if the template content matches the content on partners portal, click Sync template.

Manually approved	

When you edit a template in MoEngage and save it, it will move to the Manually approved state. If the template is not exactly the same as the template on the vendor portal and you create WhatsApp campaigns using this template, the campaign creation will fail because of template mismatch.

	

You must update the template in MoEngage to ensure that the content matches the content in the template in the vendor portal exactly.

Placeholder Links in the Message Body

You can track links in the body if they have been defined as placeholders in your WhatsApp Template by turning the Shorten and track URL for toggle on as in the following image:

URL Shortening - Things to Note

The following points are to be noted for URL Shortening:

Shortened Links expire in fourteen days and cannot be tracked after expiry. When a customer opens a link beyond its expiry, they see a ""This link is no longer active"" message.
If user and event attributes are used in the shortened links, the attributes' names must abide by the following:
They must not contain spaces.
If the attributes contain links, their values should not contain http:// or https://. These can be added before the attribute to shorten the link.
Special characters such as apostrophes and commas are not supported in shortened links.
Multiple JINJA operations are not supported in links that are to be shortened. For example, using a Content API link in a Product or vice versa (in a link that is to be shortened) is not supported.
Dynamic Link Tracking

Do the following for dynamic link tracking:

The template to be approved with the WhatsApp partner must have the following URL: 

https://ux.mnge.co.
Note: The 'X' in the URL refers to the MoEngage Data Center (DC). MoEngage hosts each customer in a different DC. You can find your DC number (value of X) and replace the value of 'X' in the URL by referring to the DC mapping here.

Create a template in MoEngage with the following configuration:

When creating a campaign, add the URL desired. Links will be shortened automatically.

MoEngage recommends that you verify your WhatsApp message displayed in the preview.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

A Recommendation (Product sets) that is set up and mapped to a user action.
Have a pre-approved WhatsApp template with placeholders to accommodate the data from the Recommendations (Product sets). For example, if you wish to personalize the user name from the user attributes and add the recommended product's title and link from the Recommendation (Product sets), get a template approved with three placeholders, as explained in the example below.

To send a dynamic product recommendation using WhatsApp, do the following:

In step 2 of the campaign creation process, select the Sender with whom the Recommendations template has been approved.
Select the approved template.
Fill in the placeholders by typing @. In the personalization screen that opens up, choose the user attribute and product set attributes.

For product sets, choose the desired product set and click ok. This will add the product set to the placeholder. A product set typically contains a list of items, each with specific attributes such as name, title, id, image link, and so on. Adding a product set as such with display all the contents of the product set in the message.
To add only one item to the Recommendations set, loop through the product set as explained below and fetch the desired item. For this item, fetch the desired attribute by typing @ inside the for loop and select the desired property from the product set in the personalization window.
Click on the personalized preview to see the message for a specific user.

In the example shown below, the template has three placeholders:

the first placeholder is used for personalization and is fetched using the firstname user attribute.
the second placeholder loops through a product set called ProductSet to fetch the first item in the product set and display its title using the following JINJA code. In this example, the Recommended product is Sneakers.
JINJA
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	 

	{% if ProductSet.product_recommendations%}

	{% for product in ProductSet.Recommendations[0:1]%}

	{{product.title}}

	{% endfor %}

	{% else %}

	MOE_NOT_SEND

	{% endif %}

3. the third placeholder loops through the Recommendations product set to fetch the link for the recommended product using the following JINJA code:

JINJA
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	 

	{% if ProductSet.Recommendations%}

	{% for product in ProductSet.Recommendations[0:1]%}

	{{product.link}}

Why Do the Delivery Error Logs of Gupshup Display UNKNOWN_SUBSCRIBER?
Problem

The UNKNOWN_SUBSCRIBER error is a major factor that causes issues in WhatsApp campaigns.

Cause
The issue can be caused by various reasons, including:
The recipient's phone number is not registered on WhatsApp.
The recipient has not accepted the latest Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
The recipient is using an outdated version of WhatsApp and did not update to the following versions or higher:
Android: 2.21.15.15
SMBA: 2.21.15.15
iOS: 2.21.170.4
SMBI: 2.21.170.4
KaiOS: 2.21.30.10

Troubleshooting and FAQs - WhatsApp
Common Errors in WhatsApp Campaigns

WhatsApp Message sending and delivery can fail for various reasons, some of them being invalid templates or outdated user opt-in statuses at the Gupshup end, and so on. Here are the most frequently occurring errors and their reasons:

Internal Errors

There are a few errors that are generated by our internal system while sending WhatsApp Messages:

Error	Description
Personalization Failed	Occurs when Message Personalization fails and No Fallback message is set. The system will not send the message to the user and will generate the Personalization Failed error.
Invalid Mobile Number	

Occurs in the following scenarios:

When the Mobile number field is Empty, None, N/A, undefined, null, or 0 (zero).
When the Mobile number field contains any Unicode character or the Length is less than 4.
When the mobile number is not convertible to E.164 format.

Users removed due to Global Control Group	Occurs when the user is part of the Global Control group, and hence MoEngage did not send any message to the user.
Rejected because of DND	Occurs when the user qualifies for an event-triggered message during the configured DND hours. MoEngage will not send the message to the user in such a case.
Not sent due to campaign level min delay	Occurs when the user qualifies for two messages or messages from the same campaign, but the message is not sent because of minimum delay settings in the campaign.
BSP/WSP Errors

Messages may fail to be delivered because of the errors recognized by the WhatsApp Service Provider (WSP) as soon as MoEngage hands over a WhatsApp Message to WSP to deliver to the end-user. 

The following is the list of errors:

info	

Information

This list is not exhaustive. Reach out to the vendor's Account Manager if you see exceptions and need more information.

For Infobip, refer to the documentation here.

Error Message	Description	Resolution
Message does not match WhatsApp HSM template or INTERACTIVE BUTTON TEMPLATE MISMATCH	Occurs due to a problem with template data. Either the parameters sent in the template are not expected, or the template you have added on MoEngage does not match what was approved on the vendor end.	Check and update the template in MoEngage with the approved template on the vendor's portal.
Authentication failed due to invalid userId or password	Occurs when you have added an invalid user ID or password while adding Gupshup sender on MoEngage. Reach out to the Gupshup team to validate the same.	

Check the User ID and Password provided for adding the sender. 

 

Note: Always add the User ID for your WABA configuration (not the Gupshup portal login details). User ID typically is in a 2xxxxxxxxx pattern.


UNKNOWN_SUBSCRIBER: Unknown/invalid number/does not exist on WhatsApp or Phone number not subscribed	Occurs when the user's number saved on MoEngage is not a WhatsApp Number.	

Check if the mobile number is valid and if the mobile number exists on WhatsApp. 

 

To exclude such users from future campaigns, update the OPTIN status to False in the MoEngage platform.


The method ""SENDMESSAGE"" is not supported	Occurs when your WhatsApp Phone number saved with MoEngage as Sender is not a valid number. Reach out to the Gupshup team for more details.	Check the sender number, that is, WABA business number. If it's the same, reach out to your vendor.
The ""INTERNATIONAL_PHONE"" service is disabled for you. Kindly get the service enabled before using this action	Occurs if you are trying to send the message to an international number and the service is not enabled for your WhatsApp Business Number. Reach out to Gupshup to get the international service enabled.	Please contact your vendor to enable the international service for your account.
Message length exceeded. The Max limit for type TEMPLATE is 1024	Occurs because the length of the body text has exceeded the prescribed limit of 1024 characters.	Reduce the body text to less than 1024 characters.
WhatsApp connector API generic failure	Occurs if you did not add the valid URL in Infobip's WhatsApp sender details.	Check for the Infobip URL to start with the https:// prefix.
Generic Error from Gupshup	Occurs when the exact error details are not shared by the vendor. 	Please contact your vendor to check the exact error.
Invalid credentials	Occurs when the authentication details are not valid.	Check the authentication details and if the issue still persists, please contact your vendor.
Invalid phone number or Invalid mobile number	Occurs when the user's number saved on MoEngage is not a valid mobile number or not a valid WhatsApp number.	

Check if the mobile number is valid and if the mobile number exists on WhatsApp.


Mobile number is not Opted In	Occurs when the user's number saved on MoEngage is not opted-in for receiving WhatsApp messages. 	

If you have the consent of the user, update the opt-in status on MoEngage and business service provider (BSP).


Validity of your SMS pack has expired	Occurs when the validity of your SMS or WhatsApp has expired for that sender ID or WABA number.	

Please contact your vendor to extend the validity of your pack. 


WA Compatibility	Occurs when the user is on an older version of WhatsApp or when their phone number is no longer registered with WhatsApp. 	

This would resolve automatically after the user has updated to the latest version of WhatsApp.


User Part of Experiment	Occurs when the message does not get delivered due to Per-User marketing template message limits of WhatsApp.	

You can create high quality experiences by using some of the practices listed here.


invalid destination source	Occurs when the IPs are not whitelisted at your WhatsApp BSP/WSP end.	

To configure static IPs, refer here.

Note

For errors on WSP, we recommend contacting your WSP in case you need more help and guidance.

Getting Started with Facebook Audience
Understanding Facebook setup for Custom Audience integration

Before creating Facebook Audience campaigns, please ensure the setup is ready. All the prerequisites are explained in this article. 

To sync audience or users to Facebook using a third-party tool, you will be using Meta's Marketing API. You will need access to the Meta App and Ad account to use the Marketing API. You can use either an existing App and Ad account or create a new one.

The following sections explain creating or using an existing App and Ad Account. Before you proceed, please take note of the important permissions required for FB Apps and how to get them.

info	

Note

For more details on Facebook App types, refer to the Meta documentation.
The MoEngage<>FB Audience integration requires STANDARD access for Ads management and Ads read permissions. Based on your app type, here's what you need: 
If you create a Meta app with the type Business, you don't need ads_management and ads_read permissions as the business apps have STANDARD access for these permissions by default. Also, a business app doesn't have a development or live mode anymore.
But, if you are using an old Business app that still has a Live mode, then in Live mode, you would need to undergo an App review process to get ads_management and ads_read permissions. To circumvent this, create a new Business app, and you can bypass the App Review process if your app is currently in dev mode and you want to switch from dev to live mode.
If you create an app with type Gaming/Consumer or with type None, then you would need to undergo the App review process to get ads_management and ads_read permissions once your app is in live mode. 
Ads management and ads read permissions are required to use Meta Marketing APIs. Without these permissions, MoEngage cannot sync with Facebook for adding/deleting users in FB Audience.

Getting Started with Facebook Audience
Facebook Audience Settings on MoEngage dashboard

This article will help you with the one-time configuration required for Facebook. This configuration establishes a connection between MoEngage and your Facebook account. Before you proceed with the settings, make sure you have the App & Ad account ready as per the required configurations explained in the document Facebook setup for custom audience integration.

info	

Note

This is a one-time setup; you will only be required to do this step again if the app secret or user token becomes invalid.
The FB settings can be added/modified by a user with Admin access to the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer to access roles.

Once you are all set, fetch the following fields as explained below.

To integrate your Facebook account with MoEngage, navigate to Settings -> App marketplace and choose Facebook audience.

1. App ID:

Go to https://developers.facebook.com/apps/. Select the app you want to sync. App ID is present on the top bar on the left
Alternatively, you can go to https://business.facebook.com/settings/apps. Select the app you want to sync & copy the App ID present below the app name

2. App secret:

In your FB app dashboard, go to Settings > Basic
Under App secret, click Show. 
If prompted, enter the password and you will get your App secret.

3. Access token:

Go to your FB app dashboard and select the app you want to sync with MoEngage. 
Go to Marketing API > Tools > Get Access Token
Select ads_management & ads_read permissions
Click Get Token button
Alternatively, you can obtain access token from the FB's Graph API explorer as explained here.

 

4. Business ID (Optional):

This field is required only if the user whose access token is used here has access to multiple FB business accounts and wants to sync with only 1 particular business account. To retrieve it, go to FB business info page.

After entering all the fields, click the Connect to Facebook button.

On successful connection, we will fetch the list of all Ad Accounts associated with the logged-in user. You can select one as default. 

If you wish to change these settings later because the logged-in user no longer has access to your FB business account or for any other reason, click Disconnect Facebook. Add the fields again and click Connect to FB. 

info	

Note

We need these fields to fetch all the Ad accounts from your account. We would also need the access token every time when the campaign will run where we would need to make an API call to the FB.
The access token you have entered above is a short-lived access token. It is valid only for a few hours. Once you provide this access token to us, we will convert it into a long-lived access token and store it on our end and we will also extend the token at our end.
The long-lived access token has a longer expiration time, such as 60 days or Never. We will periodically check for token validity, and if the token is about to expire within the next 7 days, we will extend the token validity. To retrieve an extended token, app ID & app secret are required.
If the user token or app secret is no longer valid, then we will notify you to update the fields on the settings page.
In case the access token is not mapped to any Business ID, the default ad account associated with the user will be fetched and result in a Permissions Error (Business account needed to create/edit this audience). Ensure that your access token is mapped to the appropriate business ID in Meta's Settings.

Once you are connected to Facebook, you can get started with FB Audience campaign creation, as explained in this article."

Create a Facebook Audience Campaign

To create a Facebook Audience campaign:

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard.
From the left navigation, use one of the following options:
Click Engage > Campaigns. The All campaigns page is displayed. At the top right corner, click + Create campaign. The Create campaign page is displayed.

Click Create New > Campaign. The Campaign page is displayed.

Under Audience, click Facebook. The Facebook Audience creation page is displayed.

Steps to Create a Facebook Audience Campaign

The following are the steps to create a Facebook Audience campaign:

Target users: Define the target audience for the campaign.
Audience detail: Define the audience to be added or deleted from the Facebook Account.
Schedule and goals: Define the campaign's delivery schedule and goals.
Step 1: Target Users

This section contains the following:

Campaign Details

The campaign details section contains the following fields:

Teams: If your organization has teams enabled, select a team in the dropdown. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage.
Campaign name: Enter the name of the campaign to manage and identify the campaign. The campaign name must have at least five characters, and the limit is 256.
Campaign tags: Select campaign tags from the drop-down list. You can select a maximum of five tags. For more information, refer to Campaign Tags.
	
User Qualification Criteria

This section helps you define the users that you want to be added or deleted from the custom Google Ads Audience. There are two types of user segments that can be defined here:

All users in segment
 
Based on trigger event

This option helps you select all users who satisfy the filter criteria. Select the All Users in segment option to create a custom segment of all the users who satisfy the filter criteria chosen in the Target users section. Using this option, you can create one-time or periodic campaigns.

Use this option if you want to sync users to Facebook depending on certain user properties. Go to the Target users section and choose either All users or create a segment based on certain rules.

Example: You can create a segment of users who have not received a Push notification on Android and iOS. All users who are part of this segment will be sent to Facebook to be added or deleted from a certain custom audience (coming up in step 2).

Target Users

This section contains segmentation filters that help you choose the target users for your campaign. The following options are available:

All Users
Filter by User Property
Filter by User Behavior
Filter by User Affinity
Filter by Custom Segment

This filter option allows you to send the campaign to all the app users. When you use this option, you cannot add multiple filters.

After selecting the filter criteria, you can do the following as well:

Create Multiple Filters: You can create and combine multiple user property rules, user activity rules, and custom segment rules to create a complex user segment using this option.
Click + Filter.
Click AND or OR.
Select the attribute or event and define the filter conditions.
Exclude Users: Select this checkbox to define the filter criteria for users to be excluded from the campaign.
Reset Filters: Click this option to reset the segmentation filters.
Show Count: Click this button to display the total number of users who are currently in the configured segment.

Control Group

This section contains information about control groups for the campaign. To exclude users from the control groups, do the following:

In the Enable control group section, enable the Global control group toggle to exclude the users from the campaign's target segment. For more information, refer to Control Group.

	

Click Next or use the tabs on the top of the create campaign navigation to move to Step 2.

Step 2: Audience Detail
Ad account ID

Select Ad Account ID that contains a custom audience. And, custom audience contains users. So make sure you choose the correct Ad Account ID from the dropdown menu. 

You will notice the default Ad account ID auto-selected here. You configured the default Ad Account ID in the Facebook Audience settings page. You can go ahead and change the default selection at any time. 

Add or delete FB Audience

Select the operation (add or delete users) you wish to perform through this campaign.

Add users to FB audience
Delete users from FB audience

With this option, you can add users from MoEngage to the existing audience or create a new list by specifying match criteria.

Select/create custom audience

Here you can either select an existing custom audience or create a new one. 

Use existing custom audience

We will fetch and show the list of custom audiences that exist corresponding to the selected Ad Account ID. You can see the name and description of each custom audience and select the one you wish to use. In case you are not able to find the custom audience you are looking for, make sure you have chosen the correct Ad Account ID. 

Create a new custom audience

You can also create a new custom audience and then use this custom audience to add users to Facebook.

To create a new audience:

On the Select/create custom audience drop-down list, click + Add audience.

The Create new audience pop-up window is displayed.

In the Audience name field, enter a name.
In the Audience description field, enter a description.
Click + Add Key Value pairs to add a few more parameters as key-value pairs for this new custom audience. Make sure that the fields you add are supported via Facebook. For the list of supported fields, visit the FB custom audience creation page.
Click Create. You will immediately see a success message indicating the custom audience ID.


Click Done. You will be redirected to the main screen where you will observe the newly created audience auto-selected in the custom audience dropdown. The users will now be added to this new custom audience.
info	

Note

A custom audience can be created from multiple sources. For an existing custom audience that was created in the Facebook dashboard itself, sometimes Facebook doesn't allow access to that custom audience externally. If you happen to select such a custom audience, the user Add/Delete calls will fail in this case.
It's advised that you do a test campaign to make sure you are able to access the selected custom audience programmatically (meaning, via MoEngage). If you get an error, please choose another custom audience or create a new one.
Facebook doesn't allow the deletion of users from a custom audience if the audience size is too low. FB hasn't provided a count for this. So again, it would be advised to do a test campaign and make sure the delete operation is allowed for the selected custom audience.
As per Facebook:  You can add an unlimited number of records to an audience, but only up to 10000 at a time. Changes to your Custom Audiences don't happen immediately and usually take up to 24 hours.
To create or edit a Custom Audience made, your ad account needs to associated with a business(should be mapped to a Business ID).
Match Identifiers

You can select one or all of the following identifiers based on which Facebook will match the user. 

Device identifier [Google Advertising ID (Android), Advertising Identifier (iOS)]
Email id
Mobile Number

By default, all the three options will be selected. However, you can decide to use any one or any two of these identifiers. For Email and SMS, the default values are auto-populated with the attribute values saved in the Email settings page and SMS settings page respectively.  

If you decide to use all three identifiers, then we would make three separate calls to Facebook for every user—one for each identifier. This is to maximize the match rate with Facebook. 

To understand this better, let's consider this scenario where a campaign is targeting three different users:

User U1: only advertising identifier exists in the system
User U2: advertising identifier and email ID exist in the system
User U3: all three identifiers exist in the system
Case 1

If you select only one identifier, let us say mobile number for matching users to FB, then only U3 will be sent to FB for add/delete operation. Because for U1 and U2 mobile number do not exist.

Case 2

If you select 2 identifiers, let us say mobile number and Email ID for matching users to FB, then U2 and U3 will be sent to FB for add/delete operation. Because, for U1 both mobile number and email ID do not exist.

Case 3

If you select all three identifiers, then all three users (U1, U2, and U3) will be sent to FB for add/delete operation. Because, one or more identifiers exist for all users. 

Another added advantage for Case 3 is that for user 3 we will make 3 calls to FB for each of the 3 identifiers. So, at FB level if one or two identifiers fail to match, still the user will be added to FB as long as at least one identifier match is successful.
This approach is the opposite of the multi-key matching of FB where a user will be added to FB only if all the identifiers or keys passed in the multi-key array match with FB, providing lower match rate.
arrow_drop_down
Test Campaign (optional)

Click Next or use the tabs at the top of the create campaign navigation to move to Step 3 ""Schedule and goals"".

Step 3: Schedule and Goals

This section contains the following:

Delivery schedule: Choose when the campaign should be delivered to your users and the periodicity of delivery.
Conversion goals: Choose the conversion goals and revenue metrics to be tracked for the campaign.
Delivery Schedule
arrow_drop_down
One Time
arrow_drop_down
Periodic
Conversion Goals

Conversion goals are optional. So, if you want to add a conversion goal, click + New goal to add a conversion goal.

You can add conversion goals to track the business metrics for your campaigns. You can track a maximum of five conversion goals. You can choose any app event as a conversion goal activity and set more than one conversion goal. The first goal will be treated as a primary goal.

For example, if you want to track the number of customers who have purchased an iPhone after your campaign was sent. (Event: Purchase event, Product: iPhone). Your conversion goal setup might be similar to the following image:

With multiple conversion goals, you can track more than one business metric or visualize a funnel for your user actions. For example, if you want to check the following, you can do so with multiple conversion goals.

How many users have viewed the product page?
How many of them added that product to the cart?
How many of them made a successful order?
arrow_drop_down
Tracking Revenue Performance (Optional)

Your campaign is now ready to be sent. Click Publish and confirm in the dialog box and your campaign is created.

info	

Note

For FB audience campaign, we will track conversions for a user once we are able to successfully send a user's details to FB for matching. Since FB doesn't give any status about whether a user was synced successfully (added/deleted) or not, we assume a success response from FB as a proxy for successfully synced."

Troubleshooting and FAQs - Facebook Audience
Troubleshoot common errors in FB Audience

Facebook has posed certain restrictions on using FB Audience using Marketing APIs. Some of the common errors that you may encounter while configuring the FB Audience campaigns are listed below.

Error in the UI	Description	Resolution


Requires business_management permission

	

As per Facebook documentation, the business_management permission allows your app to read and write with the Business Manager API. The allowed usage for this permission is to manage business assets such as an ad account and to claim ad accounts. You may also use this permission to request analytics insights to improve your app and for marketing or advertising purposes through the use of aggregated and de-identified or anonymized information (provided such data cannot be re-identified).

	

If you encounter this error, then your app needs to undergo an App review process. For more information, refer to the steps mentioned in app review.




Failed to create the new Facebook audience. Please try again.

	

This error is displayed if you cannot create a new custom audience in step 2 of FB Audience Campaign Creation.

	One of the common reasons for this failure is that Custom Audience terms are not accepted (Permission error), and hence FB doesn't let you create a custom audience. For more information, refer to identifying and resolving permission errors.

 

How to check if you have the requisite permissions?

Excerpt from FB docs

The API does not allow you to create or change Custom Audiences if the terms have not been accepted. If the contract is not signed, we trigger an errors when you try to create or edit a custom file Custom Audience

Google Ads Audience 
Getting Started with Google Ads Audience
Overview

Google Ads Audience Sync aims to help marketers improve ROI on their Google Ads spending by allowing them to send Ads to the right audiences. Marketers can retarget the users who have evinced interest in their brand or product but haven't acted (such as subscribing or making a purchase) on their interest.

Google Ads Audience

Audiences are a group or collection of users with similar interests or who have expressed similar intents. You can reach out to potential customers by creating an Audience. Google Ads allows different types of retargeting based on keywords, visited websites, demographics, customer matches, and so on. Customer match is the most effective when it comes to targeting/retargeting.

Customer Match

This option allows brands to upload the list of users who have visited their app and displayed strong intent. Targeting such potential users using Google Ads Audience can help brands convert them into actual users of the app or product.

The customer Match feature requires the brand to upload three different kinds of user data:

Email ID (hashed in SHA256)

Mobile No (hashed in SHA256)

Device ID( Apple IDFA or Android AAID)

info	

Note

You can use customer match only when the criteria in Google's Customer Match Policy are satisfied.

Updated EU User Consent Policy of Google

The updated EU User Consent Policy of Google in response to changes to the Digital Markets Act (DMA) is in effect as of March 6, 2024. This updated policy requires advertisers to disclose the following to their EEA or UK end users, as obtain their consents:

Consent for ad personalization: Used to track consent for personalized advertising.

Both parameters support the following values:

Value	Description
Granted	Users have granted permission to send ads.
Denied	

Users have denied permission to send ads.


Unspecified	Users for whom consent information is unavailable.
What Should You Do?

As a marketer, you must obtain permission from your customers in the EU region before you send ads to them.

To serve ads successfully to your customers, you must perform some changes:

Collect consent from those customers.
Update the consent attributes with the permission values through the User Attribute API.
While creating a segmentation, add another query to include a consent parameter, along with your target audience. For more information on those changes, refer to Create a Google Ads Audience Campaign.
What Does Google Ads Audience Sync do?

Google Ads Audience sync helps you sync a cohort or segment of users from MoEngage to Google Ads customer match audience. You can perform one of the following actions:

Create a new customer match list and sync a segment
Add users to an existing customer match list

Understanding Google Ads Audience App

MoEngage uses its Google Ads Audience app to enable single-click login to the Google Ads account of the client. This app will be used to gain access to the user's customer match audience only, and no other data, like ads, analytics, etc., will be modified or accessed. 

App Identity


The MoEngage app helps clients to sync user cohorts of known users, which can be segmented based on their behavior on the client app. MoEngage allows this process to be periodic, based on a user event, so the client does not need to manually upload audiences.

What does this app do with user data?

The app will fetch only the custom audiences that are present in the client's Google Ads account. The app is not going to store or edit any data. It will only help add audiences or delete customers from an existing audience.

How does this app enhance user functionality?

The app allows users to sync audiences without worrying about manually uploading the file into the Google Ads center. This will be available to all users of MoEngage.

Describe the context, content, or connection to the app:

MoEngage is a customer engagement platform that helps clients effectively engage with their app's customers. This helps marketers have an omnichannel marketing strategy that drives better engagement and ROI.

Make sure that the users you are sending to MoEngage to be synced with Google have the same consent.

Google does not allow us to sync a segment that has users with multiple consent types at the same time. Do not create a segment in which users have mixed consent types. For example, you cannot sync users with consent type ""Granted"" and ""Unspecified"" in the same batch.

What Happens If You Do Not Add This Filter?
If you send users with the same consent, MoEngage will sync them to Google ads center.
If you send users with the mixed consent, MoEngage will fail the sync. You will see the following error:
Failed due to mismatch in consent for the users
If you send users with denied consent, Google will fail the sync. MoEngage will show the following error:
Failed due to denied consent

Select the Ad account ID that contains the details of the custom audience to which you wish to add/delete users. The default Ad account ID is auto-selected. The default Ad account ID is configured in the Google Ads Audience settings page during integration. You can change the default selection at any time. 

Add or delete Google custom audience

Select the operation (add or delete users) you wish to perform through this campaign.

Add users/create new list
 
Delete users from existing audience

With this option, you can add users from MoEngage to the existing audience or create a new list by specifying match criteria.

Select/create custom audience

This option lets you select an existing custom audience or create a new one.

Types of Custom Audiences

There are four types of Custom Audiences, and these are shown in the Select/create custom audience drop-down list:

Custom Audience matched based on Android Device Identifier
This is the list of users from the target segment that are matched based on the Android device identifier. 
Custom Audience matched based on iOS Device Identifier
This is the list of users from the target segment that are matched based on the iOS device identifier. 
Custom Audience matched based on Customer Information (Email ID and Mobile Number)
This is the list of users from the target segment that are matched based on customer information - email id and mobile number.
Unknown Audience
This could a list of users from an old audience list where the mobile number or email id was not being used to identify the user. This is a rare occurrence.
Use existing custom audience

We will fetch and show the list of custom audiences that exist corresponding to the selected Ad Account ID. You can see the name and description of each custom audience and select the one you wish to use. In case you are not able to find the custom audience you are looking for, make sure you have chosen the right Ad Account ID. 

Create a new custom audience

You can also create a new custom audience and then use this custom audience to add users to Google Ads.

To create a new audience:

On the Select/create custom audience drop-down list, click + Add audience.



The Create new audience pop-up window is displayed.


In the Audience name field, enter a name.
In the Audience description field, enter a description.
Select the type of custom audience to be created using any of the following options:
Device identifier (Android)
Device identifier (iOS)
Customer info
Click Create.

After you add the new custom audience, you get the following success notification.

Match Identifiers

You can select one of the following identifiers based on which Google Ads Audience will match the user.

Device identifier [Google Advertising ID (Android), Advertising Identifier (iOS)]: Selecting this option will match the device identifiers and filter the users in the Audience.
Customer match info: Selecting this option will match the customer information based on the identifier(s) chosen.
Email id: You can choose the attribute that stores the Email ID of the customer in the DB here.
Mobile Number: You can choose the attribute that stores the Mobile Number of the customer in the DB here.

For a better match, we recommend using both the Email ID and Mobile Number.

Either customer match or device identifier will be selected based on the audience type selected above. For Email and SMS, the default attributes are auto-populated based on the Email settings and SMS settings, respectively. 

info

Note

For the Google Ads Audience campaign, we will track conversions for a user once we send a user's details to Google Ads Audience for matching successfully. Since Google doesn't give any status about whether a user was synced successfully (added/deleted) or not, we assume a successful response from Google Ads Audience as a proxy for successfully synced.
The sync is done asynchronously and can take anywhere between 6 to 48 hrs to complete."

The selected metric pins are available in the Pinned Metrics section. Click Show all metrics to see all the metrics being tracked for the campaign and Hide unpinned metrics to see only the pinned metrics for the campaign.



The following campaign performance stats are available:

Conversion Metrics - These metrics pertain to the conversion goals set for the campaign. The higher these metrics, the more effective your campaign! The conversion metrics tracked for your connector campaigns are shown in the table below.
Metric	Description
Converted Users	

This metric shows the number of unique users who have completed the primary conversion. Converted Users were previously called Conversions. This metric displays the number of times users converted from each campaign. For campaigns having only one recurrence, converted users represent unique users who have accomplished the primary conversion goal event at least once within the attribution window. For active campaigns, converted users represent the number of unique users converted per instance of an active campaign. A high number of converted users indicate that your campaign is effective in driving the business goals. 

 

Example

If a user receives one Campaign Instance on Day X and another on Day Y and converts once on both days, the converted users are counted as two (instead of being counted as one in the previous version.)
If a user receives one campaign instance on Day X and converts twice from the same campaign, converted users will be counted as 1.
If a user receives two campaign instances of the same campaign on Day X and converts for both of them, converted users will be counted as 2. 

Event (Primary)	

This metric shows the total number of primary conversion goal events within the attribution window (configurable) from the time user received the notification.

 

You can also view the uplift percentage in the event primary card. For more information, refer to Uplift in Campaigns.

 

Event (Primary) - The conversions for active campaigns are several conversion events from all campaign notifications. The metric is the cumulative primary conversion events after the start of the first campaign.

 

Example

 

Suppose a user receives a connector campaign for a product purchase. If the user made two purchases, then the conversion events are two.


Conversion Rate(CVR)	

This metric shows the percentage ratio of users who have performed the conversion event. The conversion count is tracked as Unique. Higher conversion events indicate higher effectiveness of your campaign in driving the business goals.

 

CVR = ((Unique conversions) / (Total sent)) * 100


Revenue Metrics	

Your campaign has three revenue metrics if they are enabled for the primary goal.

Total Campaign Revenue is the sum of the total order value across conversion events attributed to the campaign.
Average Order value = (Total Revenue/ Number of conversion events)
Average Revenue per user = (Total Revenue/ Number of unique conversions)
Delivery Metrics - The delivery metrics tracked for your connector campaigns are described in the table below.
Metric	Description
Attempted	

This metric shows the number of users who qualified for the campaign (after the removal of the users for whom Frequency capping was breached) and for whom MoEngage tried making the connector requests.


Sent	

This metric represents the total number of connector requests sent successfully. When a connector request is sent, the receiving server will return a response code indicating what happened with the connector request. Sent is the number of users for whom the request sent to the URL returned a 200 OK status.

 

The Sent rate is calculated as (Sent/Attempted)*100.


Failed	

This metric represents the sum of the number of users for whom the response from the request URL returned a status other than 200 and the number of users for whom MoEngage did not find any value against the user/event attributes used in the Connector request.

 

The Failure rate is calculated as (Failed/Attempted)*100.

The table shown below summarizes how delivery metrics are marked according to the response from the request URL. Requests are not re-tried for connector campaigns.
Response code	Marked as sent	Marked as failed
200	Yes	No
Others	No	Yes
Conversion Goals Performance

You will be able to see this section when you have set more than one conversion goal for your campaigns. The section compares the performance of goals set by the marketer for the campaign.

Total Conversions: Shows all goal events for the respective goals, i.e., if a user made a purchase twice, it will be shown twice. It is the equivalent of conversion events covered in the sections above.

Unique Conversions: Goals are unique across the users converted per campaign instance. It is the equivalent of the Conversions metric covered in the sections above.

You can view the uplift percentage in the tabular view of Conversion Goals performance. For more information, refer to Uplift in Campaigns.

Campaign Delivery

The campaign delivery stats section helps you understand the delivery funnel and the number of users that were removed in each funnel stage. The various delivery funnel stages are explained in the table below:

Funnel Stage	What it represents
Users in segment	Represents the total number of users in the segment who have qualified for the campaign
Users after FC Removal	Represents the number of users obtained after removing requests that have crossed Frequency Capping as defined in the FC Settings for Connectors.
After Personalization Removal	Represents the number of users obtained after removing requests for which there were personalization failures.
Sent	Represents the number the count of the number of connector requests that have a 200 response from the request URL.
Error breakdown

This section describes the various campaign delivery failures and their reasons. Errors are categorized under the following heads:

Failed to Send errors - these errors happen when the request has not been sent, and they could happen due to one of these reasons:

users who have been removed as they were part of the campaign's control group
users who were removed from the campaign owing to a Frequency Capping limit breach
users for whom the request URL returned a response other than 200
users for whom personalization attributes were not available and thus were dropped from the campaign. Click See breakdown in the Name column for Personalization errors to get a detailed view of the number of users for whom personalization has failed and their reasons. 

 

Personalization errors can be classified into the following categories:

Error Category	Description


User Attribute

	This denotes the unavailability of the user attribute used in personalization either because it is not available in the system (for example, copy-paste errors) or it is not available for the specific user. For example, if the first_name user attribute is used in personalization and it is not available for a user, this will result in a User Attribute error.


Event Attribute

	This denotes the unavailability of the user attribute used in personalization either because it is not available in the system (for example, copy-paste errors) or it is not available for the specific user. For example, if the product_name event attribute is used in personalization and it is not available for a user, this will result in an Event Attribute error.


Campaign Attribute

	This denotes an unavailability of campaign-specific information used in personalization. For example, if campaign tags have been used for personalization and the campaign tag attribute is missing, this will result in a Campaign Attribute error.


Undefined

	

This denotes errors that happen when MoEngage is unable to fetch the value for the attribute used in personalization. For example, if the image attribute is unavailable for a specific product in a product set, this will result in an Undefined error.




Unknown

	This denotes any error that does not fall into any of the categories mentioned above.

Note: The number of failures listed in the Personalization Failed category under Failed to Send denotes the unique number of users for whom personalization has failed. In some cases. this might differ from the count shown in the Personalization failure analysis UI as multiple failures can happen for the same user and they might be counted under each of the failure categories shown in the UI. For example, if a user were to have a user attribute and event attribute failure, they would be counted for the number of failures in both these sections in the analysis screen while they would be counted as one in the Personalization Failed section.

1. Attempted: After removing the users who breached the FC, Attempted is calculated as the number of users who qualified for the Connector campaigns and we attempted making connector requests for them

2. Successfully Sent : When the connector request is sent, the receiving server will return a response code indicating what happened with the connector request. Successfully sent is the number of users for whom the request to the request URL returned 200 OK status. 

3. Failed: Number of users for whom the response from the request URL returned any status other than 200 or the users for whom we fail to find any value against the user/event attributes used in Connector request. 

To summarize:

Response Code	Marked as successfully sent	Marked as failed	Retried?
200	Yes	No	No
Others	No	Yes	No

You will also be able to see the split of failures and their reasons as here:

Personalization Failed occurs when one or more of event/user attributes used in request are not found for the specific user. For more information, refer to Common Personalization Errors and FAQs.

Why Is the Campaign-Level Control Group Unavailable in Connector Campaigns?
Problem 

Unable to use the campaign-level control group when creating connector campaigns.

Solution
MoEngage does not support campaign-level control groups for connector campaigns.
However, you can work around this limitation by including the connector campaign in a Flow.

In the Flow segmentation settings, you can set up the Flow control group for the entire flow.


This Flow control group is applicable to the target audiences of the connector campaign."

Terms to Know 

Before you get started, it might be helpful to understand the MoEngage terminology in Connected Apps.

Term	Description	Example


Connected App

	

Any third-party app/tool to which you want to send details from MoEngage. It can be a messaging app, an ads/retargeting platform, or any internal tool in your MarTech stack.

	
Messaging apps: Telegram, Line, Viber
Ads/retargeting platform: Snapchat Ads, Pinterest Ads, Criteo Ads
Support tool: Freshdesk, Zendesk

Note: The listed examples are illustrative and may not be currently supported by MoEngage. The table above contains a comprehensive list of supported applications.


App Type	

MoEngage supports two types of apps: connected sources and connected channels. In this article, Connected Channels are referred to as an App type.

	-- 
Channel Connector	

A Channel Connector (or simply a Connector) is a configuration that defines the integration between MoEngage campaigns and the Connected App.

A connector connects to a specific API at the destination and aims to unlock a specific use case. 

	

A Criteo Ads' Connected Channel will have two connectors:

Add users to a customer list.
Remove users from a customer list.

Connection	

When you integrate a connector for your Connected Channel, a Connection is created. When configuring new connections, you can name them for easy identification in MoEngage.

	

In case you are using two different Criteo Ad accounts (for Business A and Business B), you can connect them separately on MoEngage as separate connections:

Criteo Business A 
Criteo Business B 
Create a Connected Channel

With the Connected Apps platform, you can onboard your favorite channels with minimal effort. For more information, refer to Create a Connected App."

false
	

If true, the value of this input variable is encrypted in our storage. Use this only for highly sensitive data collection, not for PII such as passwords and keys.


validations	No 	Object 	

 

Refer here for the validations.

	

Use it when you want to restrict the values. You can add regex rules to add frontend validations.

Visibility Scope 

The Input Variables are collected in the following places:

App Marketplace

Campaign Creation Form (Step 2)

App MarketPlace

Connections to your Channel App are added from the App marketplace, as shown below:

 In the App marketplace, you must collect fields that serve as authentication requirements or are common to all campaigns. These fields must be independent of campaign information.

For example, collecting the Telegram Bot ID in the App marketplace is recommended. This allows you to execute multiple campaigns using the same Telegram Bot. On the other hand, collecting Telegram Chat IDs in the App marketplace is not recommended, as they are campaign-dependent and must be changed for each end-user.

info	

Information

MoEngage displays the Connection name for each Connector in the App marketplace by default. This provides a visual identifier to distinguish the Connections.

Campaign Creation Form (Step 2)

Connections to your Channel app are added from the campaign creation, as shown below:

Supported Input Types

	  ""required"": {{true or false}},

	  ""type"": ""key_value""

	}
Input Validations

When defining input types that support validation, such as Text and Password, it is necessary to establish predetermined rules for validating the values entered by the user on the UI. You can add validations with the following key inside your input variables:

Structure
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	""validations"": [

	    {

	        ""text"": ""Rule description"",

	        ""regex"": ""<regex expression>""

	    }

	]

Here is an example of a Full Name field which has three individual rules:

Structure
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	""validations"": [

	    {

	        ""text"": ""Start the name with an alphabet"",

	        ""regex"": ""^[A-Za-z]""

	    },

	    {

	        ""text"": ""Use only numbers, spaces, \""_\"" or \""-\"" with alphabets"",

	        ""regex"": ""^[a-zA-Z0-9-_ ]*$""

	    },

	    {

	        ""text"": ""Use 3-25 characters"",

	        ""regex"": ""^[a-zA-Z0-9 -_]{3,25}$""

	    }

	]

Each of these rules is shown to the user on the UI to guide them toward valid input:

Reference Input Variables

After collecting values for your Input Variables from the user, you can use them in the following sections:

Authentication
Request and Response

You can use the JINJA code to reference an input variable. This referencing mechanism is similar to personalization in MoEngage. For example, consider the following  Input Variables:

From the App marketplace:
Username: String
From the Campaign Creation Form (Step 2):
Mobile Number: String

To reference these variables, use the following JINJA code:

JINJA
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{{AppMarketplaceForm[""username""]}}

	{{CampaignCreationForm[""mobile_number""]}}

These Input Variables capture the user's input, which can be used during authentication or included as part of the API request payload.

Authentication

This section allows you to define the authentication required for your App. MoEngage uses this setup to send requests to your app, and the Connected Channels support the following out-of-the-box authentication types:

No Auth
Basic Auth
API Key Auth
Key	Required	Type	Description
auth_type	Yes	String	

It represents the type of authentication you want to use for the Connector. The valid options are

no_auth
basic_auth

auth_info	Yes	Object	It represents the authentication details, which depend on the type of authentication you selected.
alias	Yes	String	NIL
No Auth

You can choose No Auth when your App does not need authentication or you have a custom implementation of standard authentication methods. If you select No Auth, MoEngage does not execute any pre-authentication operations on your requests.

When using ""No Auth,"" choose No Auth as the app type. If necessary, you can include custom URL parameters or headers for your API.

Structure
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	""auth"": {

	    ""auth_type"": ""no_auth"",

	    ""auth_info"": {},

	    ""alias"": ""valid_alias""

	}
info	

Information

You must pass an empty object in the auth_info key, as no additional information is required for this app type.

Basic Auth

If your App supports Basic Auth, you can collect the username and password on the App marketplace and pass them as part of your Basic Auth Token for each request.

To add Basic Auth, follow the structure:

Structure
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	""auth"": {

	    ""auth_type"": ""basic_auth"",

	    ""auth_info"": {

	        ""username"": ""{{AppMarketplaceForm[\""account_id\""]}}"",

	        ""password"": ""{{AppMarketplaceForm[\""account_key\""]}}""

	    },

	    ""alias"": ""valid_alias""

	}

In the example above, we refer to the values entered by the user on the App Marketplace form. MoEngage generates a Base64-encoded Basic Auth token and includes it in each request's Authorization header.

For example, if the Account ID is ABC123 and the Account Key is 123XYZ, you must pass the following header in each of our requests:

Authorization: Basic QUJDMTIzOjEyM1hZWg==

Request and Response

In this section, you must set up the API requests that MoEngage initiates for each campaign sent. After a request is made from MoEngage, you can set up how the Campaign Stats are calculated based on your API requests' responses.

warning	

Warning

MoEngage does not support stats that might be asynchronous or driven by callbacks today.

Campaign Requests

MoEngage attempts to send API requests to your App each time a campaign is sent out.
For example, if a campaign is directed to 50 users, MoEngage makes 50 API requests for that campaign.

warning	

Warning
The following are not supported:

Frequency Capping or Do-Not-Disturb (DND)
Throttling

Response Handling

After making an API request, you can inform MoEngage how to interpret the response. You can also add multiple responses to your request by covering all your responses, such as successes and failures.

A response consists of two parts:

Response conditions: Based on the response provided by your API, you can add conditions to its Status Code, Header Values, or even the body payload. When these conditions are fulfilled, you can perform actions in MoEngage.
Response actions: Actions are operations performed by MoEngage. 
Use Cases

There are several use cases for response handling. The following are the types of tracking used for various use cases:

Stats tracking: This displays accurate Success and Failed stats for your campaigns.
Event tracking: These are trigger events that occur when certain conditions are fulfilled. They can help you to create other journeys for your users.

Web Personalization 
Getting Started with Web Personalization
Introduction

Web Personalization can be used to modify the website content for each user by sending personalized data when users access the website. A few popular use cases for Web Personalization include the home page banner personalization based on user behavior, localizing the website content based on user geography, testing the performance of new page layouts for improved performance, and so on.

Integration Essentials
Ensure that you have integrated our web SDK before setting up self-handled campaigns. For more information, refer to Web SDK Integration.
Get MoEngage Web Personalization enabled for your MoEngage account by contacting your CSM or the MoEngage Support team.
Ensure that you have handled the default and fallback content that needs to be displayed in case of personalization failures / API failures or delays in fetching the content from MoEngage servers.
With Self Handled campaigns, MoEngage will deliver personalized data to your website. The website needs to consume this data and handle the display.
Once the data is displayed on the website, the website needs to send Impressions and Click events to MoEngage to facilitate the calculation of stats for campaign performance. For more information, refer to campaign statistics.

To contact the MoEngage Support team, you can raise a ticket through the Support Web Form within the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer here.
 

TAG_NAME

Every Web Personalization Campaign created on the MoEngage Dashboard is associated with a Campaign Tag, as described in the Campaign Creation guide. This TAG_NAME helps the MoEngage Web SDK choose the exact campaign for fetching personalized content from the available campaigns.

Tag_Name is a parameter of the function to fetch personalized data. Once this function call is made, MoEngage SDK will deliver the personalized data to your website. Once the data is received, the website needs to consume this data and take action."

Click Next.
Step 2: Campaign Data

This section describes how to add content to the campaign as described below:

Enter the Campaign Tag.


A Campaign Tag is used to fetch the correct campaign data from a list of active campaigns for your account in MoEngage.
For example, say you have 3 active campaigns for your website -
Campaign 1: For Home Page Banner
Campaign 2: For Best Selling Products on Home Page
Campaign 3: For Recommended Products on Home Page

 

To help deliver the appropriate campaign data to the relevant field on your Home Page, you need to set a campaign tag which will help fetch correct data.

 

When a user opens your website's homepage, MoEngage SDK will fetch the above 3 campaigns associated with the same Campaign Tag and deliver the personalized data to the website.

Enter your personalized Campaign Data.
The campaign data is the message that will be delivered to your users when they open your webpage. This data should be in a JSON format and can contain Image URL, Text or any other key value pairs that will be consumed by your website.

Message Archival
Message Archival
info	

Information

The Message Archival feature is an add-on (paid). To know more, talk to your Customer Success Manager or raise a support ticket. 

Overview

Message archival is the process of storing any communication sent to customers for later access. Retaining these customer messages is important for multiple reasons, including:

Regulatory compliance: Various regulatory bodies globally, depending on the region and/or industry (especially in the BFSI sector), mandate businesses to store any ""electronic communication"" with the customer. While certain rules recommend storing customer communications, others necessitate businesses to do so. In a few cases, the retention rules also describe the type of communication that should be retained, for instance, either storing all messages (including promotional ones) or storing at least transactional messages for a defined period.
Some rules and guidelines by the respective regions are as follows:

Country or Region	Rule or Guideline
US	FINRA Rule 2210
SEC Rule 17a-4
GLBA Rule for Financial Information Privacy
FRCP Rule 26
Canada	IDA 29.7
EU	MiFID II
UK	Durable Medium
India	Digital Lending Guidelines
The retention period varies for each rule: for instance, SEC Rule 17a-4 has a default six-year retention period whereas GLBA rule for Financial Information Privacy has a default retention of seven years.
Customer experience: Your customers may be contacting your support touch-points, enquiring about a message they have received. To serve these customers better, you need to empower your teams with information on all transactional and/or promotional messages sent to customers. Your customer service teams can then respond to a customer query and/or complaint by reviewing the personalized message sent to the customer. 

Combining this with the message sent/delivery events (using MoEngage S3 Exports or Streams) can give your teams a 360-degree view of messages received or those that remained undelivered because of various reasons such as the Email box being full or mobile number being unavailable and so on. This 360-degree view of communication sent by you (brand) to your customers helps customer service teams get a holistic context, thereby reducing the turnaround time (TAT) and the cost to serve and, more importantly, improving the overall customer experience.

Audit: Message archival is a powerful tool for reviewing the content sent to customers. If ever there is a case where a customer complains or disputes a message they received, you can use these archived files to identify the relevance of the claim. 

Recommendation: Retain a copy of the customer messages for at least two to six months, if not more, for the aforementioned reasons.

Message Archival in MoEngage

MoEngage offers the Message Archival feature where businesses can choose to keep a copy of actual notification content sent to customers. This feature helps you stay compliant with regulations, solves your audit needs, and enables you to cater to your customers better. The feature is available for the Email, SMS, and Push channels.

Other benefits of this feature include:

Indefinite storage: You can choose to store these messages in MoEngage for a month or as long as you need.
Automated archival: Once the feature is enabled, it would automatically archive customer messages across all vendors/platforms for the specified channels.
Secure storage: MoEngage ensures the message files are kept in a safe manner, including keeping the messages encrypted.
UI-based access: Each message can be accessed for a user and event on the MoEngage dashboard.
Option to download each file: Easily download the message files to keep a local copy.
Fetch message files (optional): MoEngage allows you to pull these messages to your file store. All the files have a unique identifier to ensure the files can be traced back to the campaign/alert.

Message Archival is not supported in MoEngage when PII Tokenized Sending is enabled.

Store Your Files

You have the following options to store your files:

Store them in MoEngage S3 bucket
Store them in your S3 bucket

Storing your files in the MoEngage S3 bucket can be beneficial if you want to view the archived files on the MoEngage UI. If you store the files only in your own S3 bucket, MoEngage will need Read Access to display those archived files on the UI.

info	

Information

If you choose a configuration, you cannot change it later. If you decide to store the message files in your S3 bucket, you cannot change this configuration and store them with MoEngage. 

If you want to store these files with the MoEngage S3 bucket, then MoEngage will create a bucket for you and store your messages securely. 

Storing files in your S3 Bucket:

Share the name of the S3 bucket where you want to store your data and provide the read and write access to MoEngage.
You also need to provide the ARN URL for your bucket. For more information, refer to Set Up the ARN URL.
MoEngage requires the folder name for storing your files.
MoEngage requires the name of a different file path if you want to change from the default file path.

For information on:

File path and naming convention, refer to File Path and Naming Convention.
File contents, refer to File Contents.
Set Up the ARN URL

Even if you have an S3 bucket already, we still recommend creating a new bucket specifically for MoEngage so you can limit permissions.

To create a bucket for your app, open the S3 console and follow the instructions to Sign in or Create an Account with AWS.
After you sign in, select S3 from the Storage & Content Delivery category.
Select Create Bucket on the next screen and you will be prompted to create your bucket and select a region.
Navigate to the Policies tab in the navigation bar and select Get Started then Create Policy. This will allow you to add permissions for your user.
Select Create Your Own Policy. This will give limited permissions so we only can access the bucket that you specify.
When creating your own policy, specify a Policy Name of your choice and enter the following code into the Policy Document section. Be sure to replace the INSERTSID with your SID, INSERTPOLICYID with your policy ID, and INSERTBUCKETNAME with your bucket name.

How Does the Login Process Work When Switching Between Live and Test Workspaces?

Understanding the login process when switching between live and test workspace, especially with two-factor authentication (2FA) and the login hierarchy, is essential for smooth navigation across different environments.

Instructions
library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Access to both live and test databases.
Confirm the login hierarchy: SSO login > Google sign-in > Simple login.
Familiarity with enabling 2FA for the respective workspaces.
Check if 2FA is enabled for the live database.
Check if 2FA is not enabled for the test database.

Perform the following steps:

Switching from Live to Test Workspace:
Log in to the live workspace using the appropriate credentials (for example, email, password, and Google Authenticator).
Ensure the login process does not prompt for re-login.
Switch to the test workspace without logging out.
Verify if the dashboard user can switch to the test workspace without re-logging.
Switching from Test to Live Workspace:
Log in to the test workspace using the designated login method (for example, email and password).
Switch to the live workspace without logging out.
Check if the login process prompts for re-login.
Verify if the dashboard user is required to provide credentials (for example, email, password, and Google Authenticator) when switching from test to live.

The hierarchy to remember is SSO login > Google sign-in > Simple login.

info	

Information

Scenario

The live workspace uses Google Authenticator.
The test workspace uses email and password.

Behavior

Switching from Live to Test: The user can switch without logging out because a Google sign-in is more important than a simple login.
Switching from Test to Live: Due to the hierarchy (Google sign-in > Simple login), the user will be logged out and prompted to re-login."

FAQs - Campaign Management
Why Do the Failed Counts in the Campaign Stats Donut and the Error Breakdown Not Match?
Problem 

The failed numbers in the campaign stats donut and the error breakdown do not match.

Explanation
The formula used to calculate failures in campaign statistics is Sent minus Delivered (Sent–Delivered).
The number of campaign errors could be higher due to various issues listed as failed to send according to the campaign's design.
Even though these errors occur, the statistics team may not include them as actual failures.
Those excluded errors could relate to a failure in personalization."

FAQs - Campaign Management
Why Do Periodic Child Campaigns Have Higher Stat Counts Compared to Periodic Parent Campaigns?
Problem 

There are lower impressions or clicks (stats) on the periodic parent campaigns compared to periodic child campaigns.

Explanation
The product expects the periodic parent campaign metrics to be similar to the combined counts of all the periodic child campaigns. 
However, the periodic parent campaign sometimes has a lower count due to the removal of existing variations.
Example
For instance, when a campaign is set to send daily, and variations are added and removed on specific days, the periodic child campaigns created during those days will display the variations.
However, the periodic parent campaign will not display or record stats for the variations that have been removed on those specific days."

Why Is There a Mismatch in Sent and Delivery Metrics Between Gupshup and MoEngage?
Problem

There is a discrepancy in the Sent and Delivered metrics when comparing the data from Gupshup and MoEngage.

Explanation

The difference in statistics between MoEngage and Gupshup could be due to the following reasons:

MoEngage is not receiving callbacks from Gupshup.
MoEngage shows statistics based on campaigns, while Gupshup shows statistics based on templates.
Solution
Ensure the callback URL is properly set up on the Gupshup platform to receive delivery callbacks on MoEngage's end.
For more instructions, follow the Gupshup-Partner Integration document.
To verify the accuracy of the data, download SMS or WhatsApp reports from the MoEngage dashboard and include the template ID as an additional column.

Why Do the Unsubscribed Numbers Remain Unchanged for Total and Unique Occurrences?

Why Don't the Campaign Counts Match in Campaign Reports from Behaviour Analytics for the Same Duration?

Conversion and Attribution
Overview

When your campaigns are live, it's time to analyze their performance to understand which campaigns have performed well and which ones are yet to. Conversions are important metrics to track to understand how impactful your campaign is and whether you are able to achieve what you set out to do with your campaign.

Attribution refers to conversion attribution for a campaign and helps you understand how a conversion goal was fulfilled — whether the user viewed your campaign or clicked a link or notification and then fulfilled the goal set. For example, if the conversion goal for your campaign is an Add To Cart event, attribution helps you understand when and how the user added the product to the cart — was it after seeing your push notification, was it after clicking on the notification, or was it when they were already on the app looking for something.

You can use the following attribution models that you can use for tracking your campaign's performance in MoEngage: the All Interactions Model and the Last Interaction Model.

All Interactions Model

The All Interactions Model attributes conversions to campaigns based on the following attribution types:

Attribution Type	Description
View-through conversion	The total number of conversion goals executed by users who received your communication within the configured attribution window from the time of receiving the campaign.
Click-through conversion	The number of conversion goals executed by users who clicked the notification within the configured attribution window from the time of click. Click-through attribution is click-based tracking. 
In-session conversion	The number of conversion goals executed by users within 30 minutes after clicking your communication. The in-session attribution is based on In-session tracking. 

Attribution Window

The attribution window is the duration for which the conversion goal is tracked for users from the time they receive or click a communication from a campaign or Flow. For more information, refer to Attribution Window for Campaigns and Flows. 

How does conversion attribution work?
Conversion Attribution in Campaigns
Conversion Attribution in Flows
Conversion Attribution in Campaign Vs. Flows

The following examples describe how conversion attribution works in campaigns.

 

Example 1

You send the following campaigns to the users:

A Push campaign notifying the user of the latest offers (C1)
An In-app campaign that has banners for the Deal of the Day (C2)

The conversion goal for both campaigns is defined as the users adding an item on the Deal of the Day sale to their cart. Both campaigns have an attribution window of 20 hours.

Suppose you send the Push notification at 7 PM and the In-app notification is shown to the user around 8 AM the next day. 

If the user adds an item to the cart from the Deals page at	Conversion Attribution
10 PM on Day 1	Push Campaign
9 AM on Day 2	Push Campaign and In-App Campaign
8 PM on Day 2	In-App Campaign

You send the following campaigns to the users:

A Push campaign notifying the user of the latest offers (C1)
An Email campaign about upcoming offers (C2)
A WhatsApp campaign about lightning deals (C3)

The conversion goal for all these campaigns is defined as the users viewing the deals web page, and the campaigns have an attribution window of 36 hours, 20 hours, and 18 hours each.

You send the Push (C1) is sent at 11 PM on Day 1, the WhatsApp at 8 AM the next day (Day 2), and the Email campaign at 11 AM the next day (Day 2).

User views the product page at	Conversion Attribution
6 AM on Day 2	Push Campaign
9 AM on Day 2	Push and WhatsApp Campaigns
9:30 AM on Day 3	Push Campaign

Thus, in the All Interactions Model, when there is an overlap of the attribution window between two campaigns having the same conversion goal, the conversion is attributed to both campaigns. To avoid this, you can time your campaigns with the same conversion goals such that their attribution windows do not overlap. For information about setting the attribution window for campaigns, refer to Set Attribution Window.

In some cases, you need to run multiple campaigns with the same conversion goals simultaneously. This can lead to conversions being attributed to multiple campaigns, and you may not get clear insights into which campaign is most relevant and which channel or flow gives you the best engagement and ROI. Having a robust conversion attribution model for campaigns is thus the need of the hour, and the Last Interaction Model for conversion attribution does that for you!

The Last Interaction Model helps you attribute conversions to the right campaign, thus helping you finetune your marketing strategies and leverage the insights gleaned towards improving customer engagement and ROI.

Last Interaction Model

The last interaction model is a conversion attribution model that considers the deepest and latest interaction of the user and attributes the conversion to the campaign with the deepest and latest interaction. Refer to Event Priorities for information about deepest interaction.

In the following scenario, a user receives a Push notification and executes the conversion goal within the configured attribution window.

It is a view-through conversion if the user does not click the notification and executes the conversion.
It is a click-through conversion if the user clicks the notification.

The latest interaction refers to the campaign with which the user interacted most recently. Interactions are ranked in depth in the following manner: Clicks > Views > Sent 

The Last Interaction Model attributes conversions to campaigns based on the following attribution types:

Attribution Type	Description
Total conversions	The sum of all conversions — click-based conversion and any other conversion such as view-based conversion or cross-platform attribution.
Click-through conversion	The number of conversion goals executed by users who clicked the notification within the configured attribution window from the time of click. Click-through attribution is click-based tracking. 
How does the Last Interaction Model work?

The last interaction model attributes conversions in the following order:

deepest interaction
latest interaction

Thus, irrespective of the latest interaction, if there is a deeper interaction, the deeper interaction gets the attribution. For example, a click event trumps a view event. In the following example:

SMS Campaign C1 and Email Campaign C2 are live and have the same conversion goals. They are received by the same user. C1 and C2 have an attribution window of two days. John is the user who:

Clicks on the SMS from C1 on Day 1 at 2 PM.
Opens the Email from C2 on Day 2 at 10 AM.
Adds a product to his cart (conversion goal for both C1 and C2) on Day 2 at 10 PM.

In this case, the conversion is attributed to the SMS campaign C1 even though the Email Campaign C2 has the latest interaction because C1 has the deepest interaction.

Event Priorities for conversions

The following are the priorities assigned to various events that result in conversions:

Campaign clicks or the click event receives the highest priority because the user shows intent and acts on it as well by clicking on the communication received. Thus, if a user clicks a Push notification, SMS message, WhatsApp message, In-App message, On-site message, or a Card and achieves the conversion goal, that event receives the highest priority.
Campaign views (or impressions) or the view event is ranked below the click event because the user is aware of the campaign by seeing it. Thus, if a user receives a Push notification, opens an email,  reads a WhatsApp message, or has an In-app message, OSM, or Card shown to them, these are only views for the respective campaigns and would receive a priority lower than clicks.
Campaign sends, or the sent event, is ranked the lowest among the lot as the campaign is only sent to the user, and they may not be aware of it or act on it. Thus, if a Push notification, SMS, email, Whatsapp message, or Card is sent to the user, these are sends and receive the lowest priority. 
Conversion Attribution Examples
Conversion Attribution in Campaigns
Conversion Attribution in Flows
Conversion Attribution in Campaigns Vs. Flows

The following examples describe how conversion attribution works in campaigns.

 

Example 1: A customer purchases a product after receiving and acting upon a few campaigns from various channels.

Consider a Push campaign notifying the customer about an upcoming lightning deal, an Email campaign nudging the user to explore deals and offers on the website, and an In-app campaign displaying a banner for ongoing deals and offers. All three campaigns have the conversion goal of a product purchase and have the same attribution window of 36 hours.

John is a user who: 

Receives the Push Notification on Day 1 at 4 PM.
Clicks on the In-app message on Day 2 at 2 PM.
Receives the Email message and opens it on Day 2 at 10 PM.
Purchases a pair of sneakers on Day 2 at 11 PM.

John's deepest interaction is with the In-app campaign because he has clicked the message shown. Thus, going by the deepest interaction, the priority for attribution in case John purchases a product within Day 2 is In-app > Email > Push. Given that the deepest interaction is with the In-app campaign, the conversion is attributed to it.

 

Example 2: A customer subscribes to a newsletter after receiving two campaigns - a Push campaign and an In-app campaign.

Consider a Push campaign notifying the customer to subscribe to receive updates about the latest products and offers from the brand and an In-app campaign nudging the user to explore deals and offers on the website by getting regular updates about offers and promotions. Both campaigns have the conversion goal of a subscription from the customer and have an attribution window of 24 hours.

John is a user who:

Views the Push Notification on Day 1 at 10 AM
Views the In-app message on Day 1 at 4 PM
Subscribes to receive updates from the brand about offers and deals in the app on Day 2 at 8 AM.

The interaction depth is the same for both the Push and In-app campaigns because he has viewed the messages. We then go with the latest interaction for conversion attribution. John's latest interaction is with the In-app campaign, and the conversion gets attributed to it.

 

Example 3: A customer books a flight ticket on a web page after receiving a Push campaign on their Android mobile device.

Consider a Push campaign for Android customers, notifying them about deals on flights. The conversion goal for the campaign is a flight ticket purchase, and the attribution window is 24 hours.

John is a user who:

Views the Push Notification on his Android mobile device on Day 1 at 8 AM.
Purchases a flight ticket from one of the web pages that he gets redirected to from the app.

This example highlights cross-platform attribution when a user receives communication from a campaign on a specific platform but completes the conversion goal (within the attribution window) of the campaign on another platform. In this example, the communication is sent using a Push campaign configured for the Android platform, and the user achieves the conversion goal on a web page.

If the purchase event is sent from the Web platform to MoEngage and if there is no Web campaign running with the same conversion goal, this conversion is not attributed to any campaign in the All Interactions Model. In the Last Interaction Model, however, this conversion is attributed to the Push campaign.

 

Example 4: Conversion Attribution when a user falls into the Control Group for two campaigns

Consider two campaigns: a Push campaign and an SMS campaign sending information about flight cancellations. The conversion goal of both campaigns is users viewing the train info is the conversion goal for the campaigns. The Control Group is 5% for both campaigns. For more information, refer to Control Groups. The attribution window for both campaigns is 36 hours.

John is a user who falls in the Control Group for both campaigns. Since he is a part of the control group, he does not receive the campaigns. If John were to view the train cancellation information, he is said to have converted. In such a case, whichever campaign has the latest run gets the attribution. 

 

Revenue Tracking

Revenue Tracking is optional and is associated with the primary conversion goal added to the campaign. For information about enabling revenue tracking for a conversion goal, refer to Revenue Tracking.

If Revenue Tracking is enabled during campaign creation, Revenue Metrics are tracked and displayed on the Campaign Analytics Page. The following revenue metrics are available:

Total Campaign Revenue - the sum of the total order value across conversion events attributed to the campaign.
Average Order Value - Total Campaign Revenue/Number of Conversions
Average Revenue Per User - Total Revenue/ Number of Unique Conversions

Revenue metrics are tracked for all attribution types. Change the attribution type using the filter on the top right of the Campaign Analytics page and view the respective revenue metrics.

Note: In the All Interactions Model, conversions might be attributed to multiple campaigns with the same conversion goal in case their attribution windows overlap. Thus, the revenue is added to all the campaigns with the attributions.

In the Last Interaction Model, only one campaign gets the attribution (the campaign with the deepest and latest interaction), and thus, the revenue gets attributed only to the campaign that gets the attribution."

Campaign Versioning
Overview

The Campaign Versioning feature allows you to edit any fields of an active campaign, which helps to save time and avoid creating new campaigns by duplicating the existing campaign. You can now edit fields such as Target audience, Trigger criteria, Exclude Users criteria, etc., in an active campaign. Every time the active campaign is edited and published, a new version is created, and the older version is retired.

This feature improves time efficiency and supports quick adjustments by streamlining the process of duplicating and editing campaigns. It also enables better targeting through experimentation with different versions, enhancing personalization and performance tracking.

Use Cases

Following are some of the use cases for this feature:

If you want to analyze and modify the audience size, user attributes, and event attributes for campaign performance, instead of starting from scratch, you can create a campaign version with the desired changes.
Suppose you are concerned about losing statistics every time you duplicate an active campaign. In that case, the All Versions drop-down list ensures the continuity of stats, allowing you to track performance.
If you are worried about managing multiple campaigns, campaign versioning will help you manage multiple versions of the same campaign. 
Create a Campaign Version

Perform the following steps to create a campaign version:

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
The All campaigns page is displayed.

Select the relevant campaign for which you want to edit. For example, an Email(Periodic) campaign is selected, in the following image.

On the Campaign analytics and info page, click Edit.

You can also click the ellipsis icon () under the Actions column for the preferred campaign and click Edit.

Modify the configured values in the relevant fields of the existing campaign. For example, the Target Platforms and Campaign control groups values are modified in the following image:

Once the changes are made, MoEngage creates a new draft version and displays a notification stating the version name at the top of the screen.

info	

Information

Changes to the Team, Campaign name, and Campaign tags are saved to the original campaign, but modifying other fields creates a new version.
You cannot modify the Start Date field value in step 3 Schedule and goals.
After you make the required changes, click Publish.

On the Publish Changes dialog box,
Verify all the changes you made to the last version of this campaign.
Enter a note in the text box.
Click Publish.
 After publishing, the older version gets retired.

Campaign Migration
Overview

The campaign migration feature allows you to move campaigns from one workspace (formerly known as a dashboard or DB) to another within the same data cluster (DC). This feature also facilitates the following:

Migrate campaigns created in a test workspace to a production workspace without recreating them from scratch. Note that you only see the list of workspaces where you have been added as a user.
If you have multiple workspaces and need to create similar campaigns in these workspaces, this feature helps you create one campaign and migrate to another.
Migrate the same campaign multiple times.
Any changes made to an imported campaign in the destination workspace will not affect the same campaign in the source workspace.

info	

Information

 

This feature supports all channels except In-app, OSM, and Web Personalization.

Import a Campaign

You can Import campaigns if you have the Create and Manager role in the campaigns. Perform the following steps to migrate a campaign from one workspace to another:

Log in to your MoEngage dashboard and navigate to the All campaigns page.
Click Import campaign at the upper right corner of the screen. The Import campaign page with the two steps in this process is displayed:

Select Campaigns
In the Import campaign page, select the Source app. This is the workspace from which you want to import the campaigns. After selecting the source workspace, the list of campaigns in that source workspace appears below.
Filter the campaigns. You can filter them based on Channels, Delivery Type, Created Date, Status, Campaign tags, and Created by. Note that you can migrate campaigns in any status other than Draft. You can select a maximum of 15 campaigns to import once.
Click Import.

If the Team feature is turned on for the workspace, you must select the Destination team to enable the Import option.

Imported Campaigns
After importing a campaign, it is in the Draft status, and an Import Status appears against it. The following are the import statuses:

Status	Definition	Example
Successful	This is displayed when your campaign is successfully imported.
Imported with errors: This is displayed when imported campaigns miss any mandatory field value, which requires a fix to publish the campaign successfully.	For example, a campaign containing a productpurchase event is created in the source workspace. When imported, if this event is not available in the destination workspace, an Imported with errors status is displayed.
Imported with warning	This message is displayed when imported campaigns contain warnings. You can publish the campaign even if there are warnings; fixing them is optional.	For example, a campaign containing a sales tag is created in the source workspace. When imported, if this tag is not available in the destination workspace, an Imported with warning status is displayed.
Imported with errors and warnings	This message is displayed when imported campaigns have missing mandatory and optional field values, which must be fixed to publish the campaign successfully.	For example, a campaign is created in the source workspace containing a Content API used for content personalization and tags. When imported, if this Content API and tag are not available in the destination workspace, an Imported with errors and warnings status is displayed. Click the hyperlink provided to take you to the campaign in draft mode to fix this.
Failed	This message is displayed when imported campaigns fail to import as certain mandatory checks have not been fulfilled.	For example, a WhatsApp campaign is created in the source workspace. When imported, if this WhatsApp channel is not enabled in the destination workspace, the WhatsApp campaign import will fail. However, you can view the reason for failure by expanding the arrow below the campaign name. Make sure to rectify the error and then publish the campaign in the destination workspace.
Click View Imported Campaigns to view all imported campaigns in the DRAFTS tab of the All campaigns page. The Source is marked as Imported for all imported campaigns. In this list, campaigns with any errors or warnings will be preceded by a warning or error symbol before the campaign name.

Identify and Resolve Errors and Warnings in Imported Campaigns

Clicking the imported campaign name with errors or warnings in the DRAFTS tab of the All campaigns page takes you to the imported campaign in draft mode. At the top of each step of the campaign, you can see a section containing the following information:

Error Status and Count	Definition
Errors and warnings on this page	This displays the count of errors and warnings on this campaign's current page or step.
Total errors and warnings in this campaign	This displays the total count of warnings and errors in this campaign.
Resolved	This displays the count of resolved errors and warnings in this campaign
Fix pending	This section displays the reasons for errors and warnings. By referring to this, you can fix errors and warnings. After fixing them, click the refresh button to resolve the errors or warnings, and the Resolved count increases accordingly.

To view the warnings, errors, resolved errors, and warnings across all steps of this campaign, click Learn more next to the Total errors and warnings in this campaign.




info	

Information

You can proceed to the next steps, even if you have warnings displayed unless there is an inline error message. Here is an example of an inline error: If an addtocart event is unavailable, the user can resolve it either by using the same event in the segmentation or a different event more suitable in the destination workspace.
The Auto Save drafts functionality is not available for migrated campaigns.
Publish the Imported Campaign

After resolving the errors and warnings, click Publish to publish the campaign. If you publish the campaign without fixing errors or warnings, the Errors/Warnings still pending pop-up window is displayed. This window displays all pending errors and warnings. You need to fix all of these to deliver your campaign successfully. Note that you can publish campaigns with warnings but not with errors. nnnn"

Flows - Cross Channel Messaging 
Getting Started 
Overview - Flows
Overview - Flows
Overview

Today’s customers expect a meaningful and personalized experience across all touchpoints of a brand such as the mobile web/website, application, and even offline stores. This calls for seamless integration of online and offline touchpoints to provide an impactful customer experience. MoEngage Flows is a powerful cross-platform omnichannel marketing tool that helps marketers provide a comprehensive customer experience across multiple channels and drive customer engagement.

What is a Flow?

A Flow is a tool that helps you create multi-channel user journeys and helps you do the following:

track all users’ actions across multiple platforms
analyze them
take decisions based on them.

Our in-house AI tool SHERPA can be used with Flows to experiment, analyze and build the best possible user journey to boost the conversions and revenue of your marketing campaigns. 

With Flows, you can have an omnichannel marketing strategy instead of using multiple channels disjointly. 

Use Case

Let’s take the case of an e-commerce website where users have added products to their cart but haven’t purchased yet. A marketer could wish to engage with customers who have viewed their cart at least once and nudge them to purchase the products in their carts.

Marketer’s Plan of action

Step 1: Wait for 24 hours and then send a push notification (EngageCartAbandonedUsers) to the users in this target segment.

Step 2: In case the users have received the Push notification, check for the users who have viewed the notification and clicked on it.

Step 3: For the user segment that has clicked on the notification, evaluate whether they have made a purchase. If they haven’t, send them an SMS with a 20% discount coupon code. For the user segment that has ignored the notification, send another push notification (RetryPush20%Off) and offer a 20% discount.

Step 4: Wait for 36 hours and send an email to the customers who have received the SMS but haven’t made a purchase.

Step 5: Wait for 10 days and end the campaigns.

Who will enter this Flow?

Marketers can choose the segment of users who will enter the Flow or the Audience of the Flow and when they can enter and exit the Flow while creating it. The Audience selection happens in the third step of Flow Creation as shown below.

Audience Definition

Marketers can add the following users to the Flow:

All Users

This option will add all the users to the Flow.

Create a Filtered Target User Segment

The 'Filter users by' option in the Audience Selection section helps marketers create target user segments by filtering them based on user property, user behavior, and user affinity. Marketers can also create custom user segments for their targeted user base.

When will users enter this Flow?

The users who will enter this Flow are defined in the ‘User Enters Flow’ section during Flow Creation from the MoEngage Dashboard as shown below.

Types of Flows
Trigger Based Flow

This type of Flow listens to users' actions across different platforms and allows them to enter the flow provided they match the Audience Definition. Some of the common use cases are:

Onboarding users once they install the app
Handling Abandonment of Cart situations
Periodic Flows

This type of Flow allows users matching the Audience Definition to enter at a defined time periodically/ one-time. Some common use cases are:

Announce Sales/ Offers
Previous Exit Flows

This type of Flow allows users to enter on exiting a previously published flow provided they match the Audience Definition. Some Common use cases are:

Retarget users exited from a certain type of flow.
Why are Flows important?

Flows help marketers explore multiple possibilities and help you improve customer engagement and experience by crafting campaigns that take into consideration the user’s actions. Check out our case study on how one of our clients implemented Flows to engage and convert new users. Flows helped the client improve their conversion rate by up to 40%.

Advantages of Using Flows

Flows Performance

In the All Flows page, for each flow, you can find its performance from the day the flow got published across all versions using the following metrics:

Metrics	Description
Trips Started	The number of trips that have started from the day the flow was published. This is the number of times users have entered into the flow. 
Converted Trips	

The number of engaged trips that resulted in at least one conversion for the Primary Goal during the time of the trip across all versions right from the day the flow was published.


Conversion Rate (CVR)	The formula for CVR is ((Sum of Converted Trips for the Primary Goal across versions)/(Sum of Engaged Trips across versions))*100

Option 1: Create a Flow Using a Flow Template

Flow templates provide you with inspiration for crafting your flows based on your goals - onboarding, incentivization, and engagement.  You can create single-channel or multiple-channel flows for sending reminders for abandoned carts, reach out to customers who are a churn risk, and improve app/website engagement. The various Flow templates are discussed below :

Template Types

There are two basic template types

Adoption: Adoption templates can be used for onboarding new customers and are available for a single channel and multiple channels.
Engagement: Engagement templates are available for single, multiple, or specific channels such as the web and app. They can be used for improving app or website engagement, engaging with customers who have looked up certain offerings or added certain products to their carts and abandoned them, and reaching out to customers who are a churn risk.

You can choose one of the following templates when creating a flow:

Template Type	Template Name	Description
Adoption	Onboard Customers - Single Channel	Use this template to welcome new customers and guide them in their journey with your product or service. This template makes use of a single channel for communicating with customers during their onboarding phase and nudging customers towards their first purchase once they've onboarded.
Adoption	Onboard Customers - Multi-Channel	Use this template to welcome new customers and use multiple channels to communicate with customers. You can leverage the power of A/B testing to identify the best channel to communicate with new users (and use this information for other onboarding Flows). This template also employs locales and conditional splits to identify the local language of the users and communicate with them in the same language.
Engagement
	Abandoned Cart Reminder - Single Channel	Use this template to send a reminder to users who have added items to their cart but have yet to make a purchase. The template uses the Wait For/Till Node element to send the nudge after a time delay (the user is sent the nudge only post a fixed time interval after they add the items to the cart) and checks if the user has abandoned the cart or made a purchase post the set interval before sending the communication. This template employs a single channel for communication.
Engagement
	Abandoned Cart Reminder - Multi Channel	Use this template to nudge users who've abandoned their carts towards making a purchase by employing multiple channels. 
Engagement
	Browse Abandonment - Multi-Channel	Use this template to engage with customers who've viewed products or looked up specific categories of products but haven't made a purchase yet. This template will help you send contextual communication and you get to leverage the power of Intelligent Path Optimization (IPO) to distribute users automatically to the best performing path intelligently using Sherpa.
Engagement
	Customer Reactivation - Multi-channel	Use this template to engage with customers who haven't been active on your platform for quite some time. This template helps you send curated offers and communicate with dormant customers. Since the Next Best Action (NBA) is employed in this template, communication is sent to each customer in the channel that they are most likely to engage with and at the time that they are most likely to do so.
Engagement
	Periodic Customer Reactivation - Multi-channel	Use this template to engage with dormant customers in a periodic manner (every ten days). This template leverages the power of NBA to communicate with each customer in their preferred channel at the time that they are most likely to engage in that channel. 
Engagement
	Engage customers on App	Use this template to engage with customers who haven't been on their app for a few days using NBA. The template uses in-app and card campaigns to nudge customers towards a purchase once they are on the app.
Engagement
	Engage customers on Web	Use this template to engage with customers who haven't been on their app for a few days using NBA. The template uses a combination of Web Push, On-site messaging, Cards and Google Ads to nudge customers towards a purchase once they are on the app.

Now that you know the types of templates, you can use them to create flows.

Frequency	Example	How It Works
Day(s)	Maximum number of entries per user: 2 time(s) in 5 Day(s)	

A user who enters a flow at 08:35AM on January 1, 2024 can enter the flow for a maximum of one more time before 08:35AM on January 6, 2024.


Week(s)	Maximum number of entries per user: 2 time(s) in 1 Week(s)	

A user who enters a flow at 08:35AM on January 1, 2024 can enter the flow for a maximum of one more time until 7 days are passed from 08:35AM January 1, that is, 08:35AM on January 8, 2024.


Month(s)	Maximum number of entries per user: 2 time(s) in 1 Month(s)	

A user who enters a flow at 08:35AM on January 1, 2024 can enter the flow for a maximum of one more time until 30 days are passed from 08:35AM January 1, that is, 08:35AM on January 31, 2024.

Note: If you select  the Month(s) option, MoEngage considers 30 days regardless of the number of days in that month.


Year(s)	Maximum number of entries per user: 2 time(s) in 1 Year	

A user who enters a flow at 08:35AM on January 1, 2024 can enter the flow for a maximum of one more time until 365 days are passed from 08:35AM January 1, that is, 08:35AM on December 31, 2024.

Global Exit Criteria

Under Flow Exit, turn the Exit based on conditions toggle on to define flow exit conditions. When the users fulfill the conditions defined, MoEngage removes them from their last known position in the flow regardless of where they are. The exit criteria are applicable for all flow types (for example, On event trigger, At fixed time, On flow exit, and On business event trigger).

MoEngage evaluates users on these conditions right from the time they enter the flow to the time they exit the flow due to reasons such as:

Passing through an exit stage in the flow path
Fulfilling the conditions in the exit criteria
Achieving the conversion goal defined in the flow

You can define the exit criteria using events triggered by users or user properties that you track for them:

User property: On the User property tab, you can define the exit criteria using user properties by specifying a value for a specific attribute. For example:
Remove users when their membership is Gold (this can be used when the flow has a fixed agenda to convert users to Gold Membership).
User behavior: On the User behavior tab, you can define the exit criteria using the list of events tracked in MoEngage. For example:
Remove users when they have purchased any product after entering the flow
Remove users when they have purchased the same product that they added to their cart after entering the flow
You can achieve this and similar use cases by linking the primary trigger event and the Exit Condition. For more information, see Linked Conditions.
Remove users when they have purchased the same product that is now back in stock.
Supported Filters

You can define exit criteria only using conditions that are of string, integer, and Boolean data types.

warning	

Warning

MoEngage does not support the conditions defined with following filters:

Custom segments
Affinity segments
Array type and GeoPoint
Special Date Filters (Daily where the hour, Weekly where the day, Monthly where the day, Yearly where the month, Yearly where the date)
last n weeks, hours, months
last n days where n> or equal to 30 days
Sherpa-based attributes

If you use a filter that is not supported, an error message will be displayed. You will have to select a filter that is supported to fix the issue.

Click + Add exit condition to include additional conditions, with a limit of five conditions. Each condition will be evaluated using OR logic with the others. If the users fulfills any of these conditions (in any order), they will exit the flow. For example, if the users fulfill the Condition 3 first, they will exit the flow even though they have not fulfilled the Condition 1.

Within each condition, you can add sub-conditions. Click + Filter to add more conditions. You can add a maximum of five sub-conditions. Each sub-condition will be evaluated using AND logic with the others. Only If the users fulfills all conditions, they will exit the flow.

info	

Information

If there are multiple sub-conditions used in a condition, users must fulfill all sub-conditions within a 30-day period in any order to satisfy the exit condition. For example, in Condition 1, you have defined the following sub-conditions.

Has Executed App/Site Opened at least 1 time
Last Seen Date is on July 25, 2024
Last Known City is New York

If the users fulfill the fist two conditions on August 1, 2024, they do not exit flow immediately. MoEngage waits for 30 days from August 1 for the last condition to be fulfilled. If it happens before August 31, the users will exit the flow. If it happens on September 2, the users will not exit the flow because the first two conditions are outside the 30-day window.

You can edit an exit criteria even after you publish the flow. However, MoEngage creates a new version of the flow in this case. This is not applicable for one-time flows.

Click Next to navigate to Who will enter the flow step.
OR
Click Previous to navigate to the Details and Goals step.

Flows - Cross Channel Messaging 
Getting Started 
Create Flows
Linked Conditions
Overview

Oftentimes, it is necessary to create customized checks that vary for individual users based on their properties or previous actions registered through events. Linked Conditions facilitate such conditional checks that can be added to a flow to determine the user's path. By doing so, marketers can devise intelligent checks based on user attributes, actions, and journey progress instead of specifying fixed values.

For example, you can check if a user has added a product to a cart at least once but has yet to purchase it or purchase a product from the same brand that they were browsing using linked conditions. You can add a check in the Flow's entry condition that assesses whether the user has purchased the particular category of the product or the specific product that they had added to the cart earlier without specifying the same manually.

Consider a user John, who browses shoes on an e-commerce platform. John adds a pair of Brogues to his cart. Since he performs an add-to-cart event, he qualifies for getting evaluated for the Flow F1.

Here's how the linked conditional check works in the Flow.

If John has executed an Add to Cart event:

Check if he has not executed a Product Purchase event 2 hours after the Add to Cart event
Match the product id of the product added to the cart and the product id in the product purchase event

Linked Conditions can help you use a Flow such as the one described above for multiple products and product categories, as the check against product purchase is not tied to a static value but is dynamically checked against the parent event (the add-to-cart event in this case). You can use dynamic checks to send tailored communication about flight delays to users who have purchased a ticket on a flight or send payment reminders to customers who are yet to pay their bill for a specific card in their account which has an upcoming payment deadline.

Use Cases

Here are a few examples of how to utilize Linked Conditions for specific purposes:

Wildcard Check between Two Events - This is an effective approach for allowing users to enter a flow only when certain events have occurred, but others have not. Consider the case where an organization wants to create a rule to send a reminder notification to customers who have credit cards, have received their bill statements, and haven't paid the bill for one or more cards. The linked conditions approach can be useful here. 

Consider a flow where users with bank credit card accounts are considered when they have not paid their bill. Adding the following conditional check:

Does the user have a bill-generated event for them?
Does the user have a paid bill event for them?
Compare the bill-generated event with the payment done or paid event by dynamically comparing the Payment Bill.Card_ID = Bill Generated.Card_ID

Enter users who satisfy this criteria inside the flow that sends them payment reminder campaigns. Ignore other users from the flow. In such a setup, we capture the triggering event of bill statement generation, wait for a user action to occur indicating payment of the bill for a specified time duration, and if this action is not taken for either of the cards in the user account, send a reminder notification to the user to pay their bill for that specific card. This approach provides a customizable and automated method of responding to specific user behavior within a system.

Repetition of the same parent event X times with the same attribute - This is a technique that can be used to permit users to enter a flow who have completed a specific action, such as searching for a product multiple times. 

For instance, if an e-commerce platform wants to create a personalized user experience that enables customers to pick up on their previous searches, this approach can be used effectively. Consider a flow where the following linked condition is present: has the user performed multiple searches for a keyword or product within a specified time period while in the flow, and does the user have an active session, or are they a frequent buyer?
If yes, move the user along a path in the flow where they will be sent campaigns that suggest similar products, deals, or promotions based on their search history.

Benefits
You can reach out to high-intent users and engage with them best using other potent features such as BTS and MPC. 
You can choose to evaluate users at the entry stage, during conditional stages, or both with the flexibility this feature lends.
Easy way to define rules and find high-intent users.
More flexibility in defining Conditions/ rules to Target users in Flows.
A smaller number of Flows required to achieve a use case
Adding Linked Conditions

Linked Conditions can be added to a Flow in the following sections:

Entry Conditions
Has Done Stage
Conditional Split Stage

Consider a Flow that sends intimations or reminders for upcoming flights. The following checks can be added at the entry-level to achieve this:

Has the user purchased a ticket on any Flight with an upcoming trip date?
Ensure that the user has not canceled their ticket.
You can also, remove entered users who have cancelled the tickets for a trip that made them enter.

You can also send campaigns to nudge users to upgrade their tickets or cross-sell other services while communicating such information with the users.

Note: While flows are capable of tracking a user's progress and initiating specific actions based on specified conditions being met, they can only accommodate a single instance of a user at any given time. If you expect users to satisfy the linked condition multiple times and would want to send a message for all those instances, MoEngage recommends using linked triggers in event-triggered campaigns.

For the same flow, you can exit entered users as and when they cancel their flight ticket.

Now that you have explored the various uses of Linked Conditions, go to the Flows - Cross Channel Messaging section to read about the capabilities of Flows and create one."

Frequency Capping (FC) allows you to limit the number of messages sent to your users during a specific period. The limit is applied on a channel (push, email, connectors) level. For more information, refer to channel level Frequency capping.

Turn ON Ignore frequency capping

Click to turn ON the Ignore frequency capping to ensure that all the channel level capping is ignored for the messages sent by the respective Flow.

Turn OFF Ignore frequency capping

Disabling the setting to OFF ensures all the channel level FC settings are applied to the Flow Messages. 

For more information, refer to Frequency Capping (FC) and Do Not Disturb (DND) for Flows.


Count for the frequency capping	

When the Ignore frequency capping is enabled as ON, the marketers can decide if they want to count the channel message sent by the respective Flow for FC. This further controls messages to be sent by other Flows/Campaigns.

For more information, refer to Frequency Capping (FC) and Do Not Disturb (DND) for Flows.


Enable DeDuplication	

Deduplication is only applicable for Fixed time entry type Flows.

When the Enable DeDuplication toggle is on, the marketers can prevent sending messages to the same channel identifiers, such as mobile number (in the case of SMS/WhatsApp) or Email ID (in the case of Emails), even if they are associated with different users for a period of 24 hours. 

In the case of Connectors, the Marketers should choose the user attribute on which deduplication should be done for all the connector stages that are added to the flow.

For Example:

Say there are User Profiles A and B with the same mobile number and Email that enters a Periodic flow. In a Periodic Flow, if the Marketer turns this on, only the first User Profile that entered the campaign stage (Email, SMS, and WhatsApp) will receive the campaign.

warning	

Note

Flows use the Frequency Capping and DND Settings set by Marketers on a channel level. For example:

Email messages sent using Flows are controlled based on the FC & DND setting for Emails.
Push messages sent using Flows are controlled based on the FC & DND setting for Push and so on.
WhatsApp messages sent using Flows are controlled based on the FC & DND setting for WhatsApp.

FC and DND settings are ignored when a default flow is created. You can open existing Flows and edit these settings. After editing, the settings are applied to all the messages sent thereafter.

Enable Deduplication is only applicable for Periodic Flows and One-time Flows.

By Default, DeDuplication will be turned off.
DeDuplication happens before actually attempting to send the campaign. So after deduplicating, it is possible that the message was not sent out due to Failure reasons like Personalisation Failure, Frequency Capping, etc.
info	

All the settings do not apply to Facebook Audience campaigns. If the setting is present in the Flow campaign, it will be bypassed for FB Audience.

Frequency Capping (FC) and Do Not Disturb (DND) for Flows
Frequency Capping

Frequency Capping allows you to limit the number of messages sent to your users during a particular period of time. The limit is applied on a channel (push, email, connectors) level. You can read about the Channel Level FC in the links at the end of the article.

In Flows, you can access settings on Top right corner.

While creating Flows, you can choose to:

Turn ON Ignore frequency capping - If Ignore frequency capping (FC) is ON, it will ensure that all the channel level capping is ignored for the messages sent by the particular Flow.

Count for the frequency capping - If the Ignore FC is ON then marketers can decide whether they want to count the channel message sent by a particular Flow for FC. It is generally done to further control messages to be sent by other Flows/Campaigns.

Turn OFF Ignore FC

If Ignore FC is OFF, all the channel level FC settings are applied to the Flow Messages. 

To know how to setup/reset the FC settings, please visit Setting up of FC

info	

Information

Flows use the Frequency Capping and DND Settings set by marketers on the channel level. For example, emails sent using Flows will be controlled based on the FC and DND settings for the Email channel. Push notifications sent using Flows will be controlled based on the FC and DND settings for the Push channel and so on.
All the Flows created by default ignore both FC and DND settings. You can open existing Flows and edit these settings. Once edited, they will be applied to all the messages sent thereafter.
DND Settings

Turn ON Ignore DND - Having this setting as ON will ensure that Do Not Disturb (DND) settings are not applied to the messages sent by this Flow i.e. messages will be sent at all times.

Turn OFF Ignore DND - Having this setting as ON will ensure that Do Not Disturb (DND) settings are applied for the messages sent by the particular Flow i.e. messages won't be sent during DND time.

To know how to setup/modify the DND settings, please visit Setting up of DND 

Preference Management Settings

If you are using Preference Management settings to automatically exclude specific users from the campaigns, you can enable the flow setting to override the preference to include the opted-out users for delivering the flow action campaigns to them. 

Other Settings

If you are using any of the FC or DND settings to restrict your messages, some of the eligible users may not receive the message. In that case, you have two options:

To move the users to the next stage in Flow (even if the message is not sent to them because of FC/DND)
To remove the users from the Flow (if the message is not sent to them because of FC/DND)
Result
 Is FC breached?	In DND Period?	Result
Yes	Yes	The message is sent again after the DND period is over. If not delivered then, the user is moved to the next stage or exit Flow as configured in Other Settings.
Yes	No	The message will not be sent. The user will be moved to the next stage or exit Flow as configured in Other Settings.
No	Yes	The message is sent again after the DND period is over. If not delivered then, the user is moved to the next stage or exit Flow as configured in Other Settings.
No	No	The message will be sent and the user is moved to the next stage.

Multiple Conversion Goals

Multiple Conversion Goals in Flows provide marketers with the option to track up to 5 user events that, when performed, would be reflective of the success of your flow. You can also track the revenue accumulated from one of the conversion goals also. 

Multiple conversion goals can be used for

Tracking the intermediate steps taken by the user while performing the primary conversion goal
Example: ""Add to cart"" is an intermediate step required for the user to ""Purchase"" an item
info	

Note

Users who have completed their primary conversion goal will be forcefully exited from the flow if the exit on conversion toggle is enabled.
Tracking the Auxiliary events the user may perform as a result of delivered campaigns from the flow
Example: ""Add to wishlist"" would also register as the success of the campaign even if the user does not actually go ahead and performs the ""purchase"".
Tracking Revenue Performance

With MoEngage, you can very easily track revenue for your campaigns. Revenue and return on investment (RoI) of the campaigns are available to you.

With multiple conversion goals, you can now track more than one business metric or can visualize a funnel for your user actions.

For example, you want to track that after publishing a flow, how many customers made the Purchase event for Product iPhone. Your conversion goal set-up will look something like this. Here iPhonePurchase is the Goal Name; Purchased product is the App Event that you want to track; product name is attribute having value as iPhone

While setting the conversion goal, you can choose for which goal you want to track the Revenue. 

In the example below, we are tracking the revenue for the orderSuccessful events.

Revenue Tracking is optional and non-mandatory. You can click on the Revenue performance to disable it. When the Revenue performance toggle is enabled, the Revenue and Revenue Boost metrics can be tracked from the Stats section as shown in the screenshot below. For information about these metrics, click here.

 

After you choose the goal, you can choose the numeric attribute which captures the total monetary value of the order. In the example, the total price for the order is tracked as revenue. You can also choose the currency in which your monetary value is being reported."

Personalization in Flows

MoEngage Flows is a series of Cross-channel (across the channels viz. Email, Push, SMS etc.) Lifecycle campaigns to be sent to your customers basis their actions/in-actions on your app/website. 

Personalized messages have always performed better in terms of Click through rates (CTRs) vis a vis non-personalized plain formal messages.

Marketers can personalize the Flow communication sent to end users basis the User Properties or User Action Properties e.g. You can communicate to your end user by his/her First Name (a user property). You can also re-target your users who have abandoned their cart by referring to Products in their cart e.g. Hey John, You left Nike Sneakers in your cart. Grab them before they are gone!

How can you do it using Flows?

You can do it simply by writing ""@"" in any of the message fields of your messaging campaigns viz. Sent Push, Send Email, Send Connectors.

 e.g. Say you want to personalize a Push Notification with First Name and Items that use started purchasing but did not.

Here is how your personalized message will look like:

 

Note:  You can personalize your message based on the User Properties, User Events, and Business event attributes(applicable only for Business event triggered flows). User events are only restricted to the: 

- primary event used as IF Entry condition and

- Has Executed event of Has Done Event conditions.

- When Personalization for selected property fails, the system will replace the property with the Text defined as the fallback value.

We always use the last instance of any event to personalize the message being sent to the users.

Note

Ensure that custom attributes do not have the same names as MoEngage's standard attributes. If a custom attribute and a standard attribute having the same name are used for personalization, it could result in incorrect personalization."

Branching of Users in Flows
Overview

You would often want to split your users based on certain conditions within a flow to personalize the experience or split your users randomly to experiment. MoEngage offers the following ways to split your users:

Way to Split	Description
Check User Attribute	This stage allows you to split your users based on who meets the defined user properties check.
Has Done Event	This stage allows you to split your users based on who meets the defined actions-based check.
Conditional Split	This stage allows you to divide users based on a combination of their user properties and actions, resulting in a maximum of 25 different paths.
Campaign-Based Conditions	These are custom stages that are displayed after you add Action stages in the flow. This allows you to split users based on conditions related to the previously-added campaigns.
A/B Split	This stage allows you to split users randomly based on the defined allocation percentage and experiment on them.
Intelligent Path Optimizer	This stage allows you to split users randomly using the Sherpa AI intelligence of MoEngage and help you experiment on them.
Use Cases
Split Users Based on Conditions

The following are the use cases for splitting users on conditions:

Want to split your users based on their preferred languages? Add a Conditional Split to help you achieve the same.
Want to exit users who have done a specific action? Add a Has Done Event stage to help you achieve the same.
Want to exit users whose user property meets a specific value? Add a Check User Attribute stage to help you achieve the same.
Want to split users based on whether the last email was sent to the users? Add an On Send Email Message stage to help you achieve the same.
Split Users Randomly

The following is the use case for splitting users randomly:

Want to split users randomly to find the channel type that works for my user base? Add an A/B split stage to help you achieve the same.
info	

Information

When you want to divide your users based on the Entry Criteria, add a Conditional Split or a Has Done Event Stage and select the option under the Flow Entry Events Category. When this option is selected, MoEngage considers the event that allowed the user to enter the flow while deciding the path for the user.

Add Condition Stages

Perform the following steps to add condition stages:

On the MoEngage Canvas, click +.

Evaluate the following conditions	

In the list, click an option to choose the start of your evaluation window:

Since entering the flow
This defines the start time to be from the time the user has entered the current flow. MoEngage evaluates the condition from the time the user entered the flow to decide whether the user meets the condition. However, the maximum look-back is 60 days. For example:

If a user enters the flow on January 1 and reaches the condition stage that’s defined to evaluate “Since they entered the flow” on March 15, MoEngage can evaluate only from January 14 because the maximum look-back it has is 60 days.
If a user enters the flow on January 1 and reaches the condition stage that’s defined to evaluate “Since they entered the flow” on February 15, MoEngage can evaluate from January 1, that is, the time they entered, because this falls within the max limit defined.
Since exiting the last stage
This defines the start time to be from the time the user has moved from the previous stage in the flow to the next stage.
In the past
This defines the start time to be from the set timeframe in the past calculated from the entry to this stage or from the time the user has entered the current flow, whichever is lesser. Set the time in minutes, hours, or days. MoEngage evaluates the condition for the time you mention with this option. For example:
If a user enters the flow on January 1 and reaches the condition stage that’s defined to evaluate “In the past for 30 Days” on January 15, MoEngage can evaluate only from January 1 because the user entered the flow on January 1.
If a user enters the flow on January 1 and reaches the condition stage that’s defined to evaluate “In the past for 30 Days” on February 20, MoEngage can evaluate from January 21, effectively for the defined 30-day period.

Type or use the up and down arrow keys to set the time duration.
In the list, select the minutes, hours, or days to set the evaluation duration.
Use the + icon to add more branches as part of the conditional split stage. Branch 1 has the highest priority, and the priority reduces as you progress down. Default branch has the least priority. For example, when there is a conditional split where a user X matches both branch 1 and branch 2 conditions, the user moves down Branch 1 as that has the highest priority. So, for a conditional split, the order of branches plays an important role where the user moves provided they match more than one branch's criteria.
info	

Information

The default branch does not have any conditions.

You can add personalized and dynamic conditional checks based on the previous user actions with Linked Conditions.

Users navigate to the default branch when they do not meet the conditions applied in the conditional split.

The order of branches will influence which branch path the user takes in a conditional split, because the priority of the branches decreases from the first branch to the last branch or the default branch.

Users meeting the primary branch will leave as soon as they meet the criteria. Meanwhile, in the other branches, they will leave only after the completion of the evaluation period.

Users navigate the branch and follow the branch after meeting the evaluation criteria.

When you edit a published flow having a conditional split, the following are applicable:

Change the display name. 
Change the branch evaluation conditions.
Cannot add a new branch.
Cannot delete a branch.

Opt for intelligence

You can configure MoEngage Flows to automatically adjust the user attribution in favor of the best-performing branch as more and more users enter the flow.

For more information, refer to Intelligent Flow Path optimizer. 

Test Setup

Add A/B Split at any part of your flow from the control category of flow stages. 

Add the number of branches you want to experiment with. You can add up to five branches in one A/B split stage. 
Configure the user distribution split for each branch. The variation percentage can be between 0-100 for each branch. 
Make sure that the sum of all the branch variation percentages is 100.  
check_circle	

Test Everything

You can use the A/B split at any stage in a flow and add up to five A/B splits in one flow.

Make sure to add different display names for each branch to distinguish between the branches on  the canvas. 

Understand the Performance

As users enter the flow, each branch's performance keeps updating on the canvas. 

Email (50%) denotes the display name of the branch and the configured user distribution for the branch, which is 50 in this example. 
4 Done is the number of flow trips that have gone through this branch. 
Converted trips are the number of branch trips that resulted in at least one conversion. 75% is the conversion rate for the branch in the example above.
The Engagement Score is a derived metric reflecting the engagement of the branch. The higher the number, the better the engagement. For more information on how the engagement score is calculated, refer here.
info	

What is a branch?

All the action stages from an A/B split node to the flow exit stage are included in tracking the branch's performance. 
If the branch splits into multiple branches, the resulting branches are considered part of the parent branch. 
If a branch merges into another branch at some point, the common flow path is considered a part of both the merging branches.
Find a Winner

You can analyze and compare the branches' performances in the report for your split node. You can click the report option hovering over the stage on canvas or go to the split node stats section in the flow's detailed stats page and filter on a particular split node from the list. 

After analyzing the branch performance, you can choose to edit the configured user distribution so that most of the users entering the flow next will go forward through the best-performing branch."

Experimentation
Control Group In Flows
Overview

Control Group in MoEngage Flows is the percentage of total user entries that you configure that would not receive any of the configured action campaigns of the flow. 

Initially, restricting some of the users entering the flow from receiving any of the messages may seem counter-intuitive at first but by not delivering any message to Control Group (CG) users we establish the baseline of the organic behavior of the Targetable audience by tracking the behavior of the CG users after they enter the flow. The flow's performance when compared to the baseline established by the control group helps the marketers validate the below assumptions with which they publish a flow:

The configured flow can only lead to higher conversions.

There is a need for engaging the users with the current flow. 

If the conversion ratio(CVR) of the control group is higher than that of the flow that would mean that users are organically more likely to convert than after receiving the campaigns from the configured hence the assumptions enlisted as not valid that flow and hence the flow stop not be continued. 

However, in case the CVR of control is less than that of the flow, then the efficacy of the flow can be understood by calculating the conversion uplift that flow has fetched concerning the control group. 

Conversion Uplift

The uplift analysis is the most common way to analyze the extent to which a MoEngage Flow has nudged your users toward a conversion. Uplift is measured against the organic conversions from the control group users and conversions of the users who did receive at least one of the action campaigns of the flow. 

Uplift = [(Flow CVR - Control group CVR )/Control Group CVR] x 100

info	

Why?

A 50% conversion uplift signifies that the configured flow has fetched 50% more conversions than what would be possible had the Flow never been configured.
Understanding Uplift Percentage
The uplift calculation is dependent on the stage and the timeframe in consideration. Thus, the upliftment for the flow shown at the top of the Detailed Stats section might vary from the upliftment shown in the Engagement Trends in the Detailed stats as the latter is calculated only for the chosen Channel while the former is calculated for the entire flow.
Example

Let's take a Flow that has a 36-hour attribution window and has been configured for a Push and an Email campaign.
Default scenario of 36 hr attribution window:

Timeline
 Hour 0 - User Enters flow (90 TG, 10 CG)
All of them are sent the push campaign Push-1, assuming all of them have received (100% impression/view-through)
0 to 24 hours - 5 users (4 TG, 1 CG) convert. These users are attributed only to the push campaign Push-1.
Hour 24 - Email campaign Email-1 is sent out, assuming all of them have opened the email (100% impression/view-through)
24 to 36 hours - 8 users (8 TG, 0 CG) convert. These users are attributed to both the push campaign Push-1 and the Email campaign Email-1.

How to configure Control Group?

The option to add a Control Group is available in the Entry Condition node as well as on the flow setting page. The control group is enabled by default and can be changed anytime during the flow lifecycle. The users will become part of the control group only after the flow is published with the control group setting enabled. 

Control group users are randomly selected out of the total users entering the trip out of all the users in the Flow's target audience. 

In order to maintain the sanctity of the experiment, we ensure that once a user enters the flow as part of the control group, they would continue to be part of the control in all their subsequent entries into the flow until the control group is removed. You can choose to disable this if required.

How Control Group users are allocated?

Due to the scale at which MoEngage operates, we split users randomly into subgroups and apply the control group split percentage to each of the groups on a daily basis. The above process is made with the assumption that an equal number of users can be allotted to the different subgroups on any given day. So there is a need to have a minimum number of users to enter the flow for the split to be maintained. Also, with time the system scales down/up the number of users allotted as CG depending on the condition so that the % of users in CG is always close to the defined value.

When marketers check the “Users part of Control Group should continue to be part of it for their subsequent entries”(as shown in the above image), the system makes sure that a user marked as CG will always be a CG user. So, if CG users repeatedly enter the Flow more than the other type of users, then the % between CG trips and overall trips is going to be greater than the defined value. However, the % split on the unique user level will be as defined.

For example, let's take the case where a marketer defines a Flow with a 20% Control Group split and wants “Users part of the Control Group should continue to be part of it for their subsequent entries”. Let users U1, U2, U3, U4, and U5 enter 1,2,3,4,5 times, respectively. Let U5 be marked as the Control Group. In this situation:

Total Trips = 15
CG trips = 5
However, the CG split has been maintained at 20% as only 1 in 5 users was marked as the Control Group.

How big should the control group be?

You can make the control group as big as 95% or as small as 1%, depending on your target audience. For example, if you expect 100k users to enter the flow then 1% CG would be enough. The smaller the target group the larger the control group should be configured to effectively measure the efficacy of the flow.

How do Control Groups work?

Users are randomly allocated to the control group at the time of entering into the flow. The control group users after entering the flow traverse through the flow as per their behavior during the trip and eventually exit the flow. These users are not sent any campaign during their flow trip.

Conversion tracking for the Control group

Similar to the flow conversion tracking, control group users' conversion tracking starts as soon as they move past any one of the action campaigns configured in the flow. We assume that these users have received the campaign and we start tracking their conversion for the configured attribution window. As with the non-control group users also, conversions performed by CG users are attributed to the action campaigns as well as the flow.

info	

Takeaway

Since the control group users will skip all the action campaigns, we get an interesting problem ""What should the conversion attribution window be for the flow in such a case?"" We can try one of the following solutions:

Approach 1: Calculate the longest path of the flow and keep waiting for that much period for control group users to convert after entering the flow. But this assumes that all the control group users who had not been part of the control group would have gone traversed the flow through the longest path, which seems very unlikely.
Approach 2: Wait for the attribution window period for control group users to convert after entering the flow. This approach gives an unfair advantage to the control group users if the configured flow is long. For example, if the largest path of the flow takes 3 days to traverse and exit, and if the attribution window of the flow is 24 hours. Then, a control group can enter and convert for the flow approximately thrice before the flow user completes one trip through the longest path.
Approach 3: We let control group users traverse through any of the possible paths based on their behavior after they enter the flow and continue to track the conversions. After they exit the flow from one of the nodes we track the conversion for an additional period that is equal to the attribution window for the flow. This way we let the control group user behavior govern the period till which the conversion should be tracked.

We identified the third approach to be the least assumptive and most intuitive. If you have any concerns or suggestions please reach out to support@moengage.com.

Editing the control group

While Marketers can choose to change the Control group variation at any time during the lifetime of the flow, we recommend against it as changing the traffic distribution may invalidate the experiment results. 

For Example, let's say you publish your flow with a 50% control group on Day 1 and 2000 user entries happen on that day. 1000 Flow user entries result in 250 converted trips and 1000 control group(CG) user entries fetch 200 conversions. Hence, the CG CVR is 20% whereas flow CVR is 25% which is a 25% uplift from the control group.

Now the next day if you change the CG variation to 10% and 1000 user entries happen on the next day. Now out of 900 regular flow entries, 45 lead to at least one conversion( i.e. become converted trips), and out of 100 CG user entries only 4 converts. Now for Day 2, CG CVR is 4% and Flow CVR is 5% which is again a 25% uplift from the CG. 

Now if combine the Day 1 and Day 2 results you will get CG CVR as 18.55% [(204/1100)x100) whereas the flow CVR during the same period drops down to 15.52% [(295/1900)x100] which gives an overall negative uplift of -16.33%. 

Even though Flow CVR is better on both days individually, the Control group wins the experiment. Changing the CG distribution has eventually altered the results of the experiment, this in statistical theory is known as Simpson's Paradox. Because of this, we strongly recommend fixing the control group variation before publishing the flow and not changing it unless you absolutely have to or you have validated the efficacy of that flow over time.

Removing the control group

If you are observing conversion uplift for your flows over a significant period of time, we recommend you disable the Control group setting for your flow. Once this is done, all the users entering the flow can potentially receive the action campaigns configured in the flow. 

If the Control group users re-enter the flow, they will also be eligible to receive the action campaigns. The list of previous control group users is also purged, so if the control group is added again, the CG user distribution will start from scratch without any influence from the previous control group.  

warning	

What happens if I remove the Control group by accident?

In such a scenario, there is no way to restore the earlier configuration, but you can choose to add the CG again and restart, analyzing the flow performance.

 

Finding the users marked as the control group

Once you have removed the control group, you might want to find them to target the users that were part of the control group and did not receive any of the flow action campaign events after going through the flow. 

Users Marked as the Control Group for the Flow

You can create a segment with all the users who have performed the ""User entered flow"" event with the Flow Id Attribute value being the flow-id of your flow, with the ""with control group"" attribute as ""true"" and ""Control Group Type"" as Flow.

Users Marked as the Global Control Group 

You can create a segment with all the users who have performed the ""User entered flow"" event with the Flow Id Attribute value being the flow-id of your flow, with the ""with control group"" attribute as ""true"" and ""Control Group Type"" as Global."

Experimentation
A/B Split in Flows

A/B Split allows you to test up to 5 variations of flow paths to determine which is the best-performing option. You can experiment with different channels, different messages on the same channel, and different message frequencies across these flow paths. 

You can set up the experiment and after analyzing the performance of each branch on publishing the flow, change the user distribution in favor of the winning branch. This will enable the majority of the users entering the flow to go forward with the best-performing branch.

info	

Opt for Intelligence

You can let MoEngage Flows automatically adjust the user attribution in favor of the best-performing branch as more and more users enter the flow. Read more about Intelligent Flow Path optimizer here. 

Test Setup

Add A/B Split at any part of your flow from the control category of flow stages.

Add the number of branches you want to experiment with. You can add up to 5 branches in one A/B split stage. 
Configure the user distribution split for each branch. The variation percentage can be anything between 0-100 for each branch. 
Make sure that sum of all the branch variation percentages is 100.  
Test Everything

You can use the A/B split at any stage in a flow and add up to 10 A/B splits in one flow.

Please make sure to add different display names of each branch to distinguish between the branches on canvas. 

Understanding the Performance

As users keep entering the flow, each branch's performance keeps updating on the canvas 

Email (50%) denotes the display name of the branch and the configured user distribution for the branch which is 50 in this example. 
4 Done is the actual number of flow trips that have gone forward through this branch. 
Converted trips are the number of branch trips that resulted in at least one conversion. 75% is the Conversion rate for the branch in the example above.
The engagement score is a derived metric reflecting the engagement of the branch. Higher the number better the engagement. Read more about how the engagement score is calculated here. 
What is a branch?
All the action stages from an A/B split node to the flow exit stage are included in the tracking of the branch's performance. 
If the branch splits into multiple branches then all the resulting branches are considered part of the parent branch. 
If a branch merges into another branch at some point then, the common flow path is considered a part of both the merging branches. 
info	

Note

When a user qualifies multiple times for a flow with A/B test, the branch within the A/B Split that the user enters is chosen randomly.

Finding a winner

To analyze and compare the performances of all the branches, you can check out the report for your Split node.

You can either click on the report option that appears on hovering over the stage on canvas or go to the split node stats section in the flow's detailed stats page and filter on a particular split node from the dropdown. 

After analyzing the branch performance, you can choose to edit the configured user distribution so that most of the users entering the flow next will go forward through the best-performing branch."

Intelligence in Flows
Intelligent Path Optimizer

Intelligent Path Optimizer allows you to A/B test up to 5 branches, where Sherpa automatically keeps adjusting the user distribution toward the best-performing path. You can focus on experimenting with which channel to use or what should be the messaging frequency in each branch and let Sherpa optimize the user distribution. 

While deputizing Sherpa to optimize the user distribution, you must also configure the metric you are expecting to maximize in your flow. This can be one out of Engagement, Conversion, or both. 

info	

Worthy Alternative

If you wish to handle the user distribution manually, you can opt for A/B Split. Read more about it here.

Setup

You can Add an Intelligent Path optimizer at any part of your flow where you want to experiment with some worthy alternative options. You can find the option to add this in the Control section of the Flow stages.  

Make sure you name each branch distinctly to identify them on the canvas. At every stage, you can experiment with up to 5 flow paths, and in each flow, you add up 5 such stages. 

Maximized metric selection

MoEngage Flows are used to solve a variety of use cases that can be generalized into two main categories. 

For increasing user engagement 
For increasing user conversions

So while optimizing a flow, we depend on your selection of metrics to be maximized in order to align the optimization to the Flow Goals.

How does this work? 

Initially, the users get uniformly distributed, and as we start getting more and more performance results, sherpa keeps adjusting the user distribution towards the best-performing branch. Based on which metric is configured to be maximized, we track different performance stats of each branch involved in the experiment.

Maximizing Conversions
For each branch, we aim to maximize the ratio of converted branch trips/total trips of the branch. This can be loosely termed as the Branch CVR as well. 

warning	

Things to notice

 

We refrain from using total branch conversions as the maximized metric as that would give preference to users doing multiple conversions on a branch and would also favor a branch having more action campaigns. Both necessarily would not mean that the branch that eventually wins is the most optimized one.

We believe that our approach relies on finding the optimized branch based on the most common user behavior leading to conversion.

Maximizing Engagement 
Similar to the conversion calculation, for each branch, we aim to optimize the total engaged trips instead of the total engagement. To do this, we give an engagement score to each branch and try to maximize that score instead of the total click or email opens of the branch. 
The engagement score for the branch is 100 times the number of branch trips that have fetched a click from at least one of the action campaigns(BTC) + one-tenth the number of branch trips that have only fetched email opens(BTO) divided by the Total Branch Trips.

Engagement Score = ((BTC+ 1/10(BTO))/Total Branch Trips)*100

info	

Help us

 

The engagement score allows us to optimize for the best-performing branch, which might not necessarily be the branch with the most clicks or most email open. 
If this approach does not suit your use case or expectation, please reach out to us at product@moengage.com  

Maximizing the combination of Engagement and Conversion
For each branch, we combine Branch CVR and Engagement score with emphasis on branch CVR as we believe fetching conversions is more important than generating engagement. So the Maximized metric, in this case, becomes Branch CVR + 1/10( Engagement Score)

Sherpa will distribute maximum users toward the best-performing branch at the time of user reaching the path optimizer stage. 

check_circle	

Keep Experimenting

Sherpa will not stop distributing users towards low-performing branches even when a branch is identified to be performing better, as the best-performing branch may keep changing from time to time as more and more users go through the flow.

Analyzing performance

Each flow branch's performance keeps updating on the flow canvas as more and more users go through it. 



A branch can be identified by its branch name. Email is the branch name in the above example.
4 done is the number of branch trips in the above example, and these 4 trips constitute 66.67% of the total trips reaching the intelligent path optimizer stage. 
The converted trip count is the number of branch trips that lead to at least one conversion from one of the action campaigns in the branch. 
The engagement score of the branch is also shown for each branch, irrespective of which metric is maximized for the branch. 
check_circle	

What is in a branch?

All the action stages, from an Intelligent Path optimizer stage to the flow exit stage, are included in the tracking of the branch's performance. 
If the branch splits into multiple branches, then all the resulting branches are considered part of the parent branch. 
If a branch merges into another branch at some point, then the common flow path is considered a part of both merging branches. 

To analyze and compare the performances of all the branches, you can check out the report for your Split node.

Next Best Action in Flows

The Next Best Action (NBA) option in Flows is powered by insights on user behavior gathered by MoEngage's AI, SHERPA. NBA lets marketers engage with each user on their preferred channel at the best time to deliver the campaign for that user. For more information, refer to Most Preferred Channel (MPC) and Best Time to Send (BTS).

NBA reduces assumptions and guesswork and uses data gathered about user behavior to select the best channel and time to engage with each user. Using NBA in a flow would help create a hyper-personalized flow for each user. Thus, flows with NBA will help drive better engagement as they are not based on the collective trends of a group of users but on each user's past engagement trends. 

info	

Note

NBA is available for all Enterprise clients by default. For other plans, this feature is available as an add-on option with BTS and MPC. Please contact your CSM or the MoEngage Support team to activate this feature.

To contact the MoEngage Support team, you can raise a ticket through the Support Web Form within the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer here.
 

How does NBA work?

When a user enters the NBA stage, SHERPA chooses the MPC based on the data from the user's engagement trends for the past 60 days. The specified fallback channel is used if the MPC is unavailable for a user. Also, marketers can send the campaigns to the users at the best hour based on SHERPA's BTS information on the user. SHERPA picks out the BTS for the user based on their activity for the past 60 days, and this information is available in the User Profile. MoEngage uses the BTS for every user who enters the NBA stage in the Flow. When this information is unavailable, we send the campaign at the default time (for users for whom BTS info is unavailable).

Adding the NBA Stage

To add NBA as a stage in a Flow, do the following:

Select NBA from the stages in the Flow.
As illustrated in the image below, the NBA screen pops up upon adding the NBA as a stage.
Choose the Fallback channel in the dropdown. You can choose any one of the following channels as the Fallback channel:
Push
Email
SMS
WhatsApp
Select the Send the notification at the best time to send (SHERPA) checkbox to send the campaign at the BTS.
If you choose to send at BTS, you can choose one of the following default times in case BTS is not available:
Yes, Immediately - In case the BTS isn't available, the campaign will be sent to the channel chosen immediately.
Yes, at App's best - If the BTS isn't available, the campaign will be sent to the channel chosen at the App's best time (when the app has the best collective engagement).
No, Don't send - If the BTS isn't available, the campaign will not be sent.
Click Done to add NBA as a stage.

Once NBA is added as a stage, you get the following view in the canvas.

You can configure the Push, Email, SMS, and WhatsApp campaigns for the NBA stage by clicking on the pen icon (hover on the NBA stage to view this option). If the MPC is Push for a given user, the campaign configured in the NBA Push Stage gets sent at the configured time. Otherwise, the NBA Email campaign is sent to the user at the configured time, as Email is the fallback channel.

Deleting the NBA Stage

Click on the delete icon (hover on the NBA stage to view this option) to delete the NBA stage. You can retain any or none of the channels configured in the NBA stage. When you select a channel to be retained, it gets added as a stage, replacing NBA. For example, if Push (the NBA Push channel configured) were to be retained, it will get added instead of NBA.

Campaign Analytics

The following NBA specific information is available in the Flows Canvas for a published Flow for the NBA stage.

Number of users who have Entered and Exited
Number of users who were reached through the FallBack Channel
Engagement Score
Engagement Score Uplift
CVR
CVR Uplift
When BTS is activated, the number of users who had received communication at Default Time is also available.
Engagement Scores

The engagement scores are calculated differently when NBA alone is used without BTS and when NBA with BTS are used together, and they are detailed below.

When NBA is used without BTS

Uplift in ES (in % )= [(ES via NBA and BTS/ ES via Default) - 1]*100
Uplift in CVR (in % )= [(CVR via NBA and BTS / CVR Default) - 1]*100

The image below shows a published Flow with an NBA stage. On Hover at the NBA stage, all of the metrics mentioned above are displayed. In the following Flow, 3 users have entered the NBA stage. Among the 3, 2 have their MPC defined as Email and BTS defined as 4-5 PM and 2-3 PM, respectively. While one user neither has MPC nor BTS.

For the above Flow, the calculation of these metrics is shown below:

Sent via Fallback Channel is 1, as One user didn't have MPC information. Since the same user didn't have BTS info, the Sent at Default time is also shown as 1. So this user received the Email Campaign as soon as the user reached this stage.

Engagement Score (ES) = ((NBA clicks + (NBA opens/10))/NBA sents)*100 = ((3+(2/10))/2)*100 = 160

Default Scores (DS) = ((Default Clicks + (Default opens/10))/Default sents)*100 = ((1+(1/10))/1)*100  = 110

Uplift in Engagement Scores = ((ES/DS) - 1) * 100 = ((1.6/1.1) - 1) * 100 = 45.45%

NBA CVR = NBA conversions/NBA impressions= 3/2*100 = 150%

Default CVR = Default conversions/default impressions = 1/1 *100 = 100%

Uplift in CVR = ((NBA CVR /Default CVR) - 1) * 100 = ((150/100) - 1) * 100  = 50%"

Flows - Cross Channel Messaging 
Edit Flows
Editing a Flow
Overview

Optimizing a flow is often an iterative process. To iteratively improve your flow, you must edit your published flows. You can experiment with a new channel or a new strategy altogether to improve flow performance. Versioning of flows enables you to achieve the same for any published flow without creating multiple separate flows. It allows you to keep all the analytics and context of the flows intact.

Versioning helps you edit published flows while efficiently managing them and viewing the revision history using logs rather than creating duplicate independent flows. You can add, remove, and change elements, add stages and parameters, and change flow paths and configurations in published flows.

This improves operational efficiencies when experimenting and optimizing customer journeys while reducing confusion and clutter. Versioning also provides you with clear reporting and insights on the performance of each version of your flow.

Use Cases
A retail brand runs a monthly discount campaign in the last week of each month. They communicate this through a multi-channel approach using a series of carefully crafted emails, SMS, and Push notifications. But the performance of these campaigns has dropped in the last few months. They can edit their flow to create improved versions of the running campaigns and optimize these campaigns.
A retail brand can edit its flows and create multiple versions to test different user paths messaging, and creative elements in a published flow without having to duplicate the entire flow. They can create multiple versions of the same flow with different channels, conditions, and stages to evaluate whether this drives improved engagement and conversions.
By editing a flow and iteratively creating flow versions, a fintech app can make changes to its published flows based on feedback from its customers. For example, if customers are having trouble navigating through the app, the fintech app can use versioning to quickly make changes to the flow and improve the user experience.

How does versioning work?

When a published flow is edited, a new version is created. For example, on adding or deleting a stage or changing the Flows settings (like conversion tracking and control group), a new version of the flow is created regardless of whether the changes are saved.

When you are done with all the changes, you can publish the newly created version. When published, the new users that satisfy the entry condition will enter the latest published version while the already existing users in the previous flow will continue to move ahead within that version only. 

When a new version is created for the Flow, the following happens:

The versions are typically named 'Version 'n'' depending on the number of versions spanned for the Flow. In the case of our example, the active Flow is labeled as 'Version 1', and the version being edited is termed as 'Version 2'.
A version selector(dropdown) is added next to the flow name to help you track the versions. The version being edited is selected in the dropdown. The version selector has the following information:
 
You can view the changes by clicking on the ""View Changes"" hyperlink at the top ribbon (Flow details section) of the page above the Flows canvas. This hyperlink will open the version logs, where you can see the unsaved and saved changes. For more information, refer to Version Logs.


Once you've made the desired changes, click Save on the top ribbon of the page above the Flows canvas. The changes saved will be available in the Saved section of the Version Logs.
Upon saving a version, you'll get the following option on the top of the page above the Flows canvas:
Action	Description
View changes	Lets you view the version logs.
Delete	It lets you delete the saved version. Once deleted, the version cannot be recovered.
Publish	

Let's you publish the draft version and retire the currently active version of the Flow.

 

Note: If the previous version is in paused status, publishing the draft version will stop the previous version.


Save	Allows you to save the changes to the current version of the Flow.
Duplicate	

It lets you duplicate the current version of the Flow.

 

Note: A duplicate flow of the current version will be created. However, the duplicated Flow will not contain all the versions of the Flow being duplicated. The duplicate Flow will only have the information contained in the current flow version being duplicated.

How does limiting user entry work across Versions?

The user entry limits are defined at the version level. So everytime a new version is published, the limit defined is refreshed for the users.

For example:

If the Limit was defined to be 1 in Version 1 and was changed to 2 in Version 2:
Irrespective of whether user entered in Version 1 once or not, All users at max will be able to enter Version 2 twice, as the Limit of Version 2 is 2.
When is a new version created?

The following actions will lead to the creation of a new version:

Flow Element/Settings	Actions that will lead to the creation of a new version
Audience	
Changing the Flow's audience

User Entry Conditions and Limits	
Changing the Trigger condition and Delay associated with it
Changing the User Entry Limit

Conversion Goals

Editing the Attribution Window added for the Conversion Goals
Enabling/disabling the Exit on conversion toggle for the Flow

Other Flow Settings	
Changing control group settings

Action Stage

info	

Note

Versioning is not applicable for the following flow statuses: Stopped, Retired, Completed, and Draft, and also for the 'One-time' time-based Entry flows.
The Entry Type cannot be changed for a published Flow.
Changing the control group settings or the User Entry Limit condition in a Scheduled Flow will not create a new version. 
For active and paused flows, the Flow's schedule settings cannot be edited except for the 'End Date' for periodic times.
Changes to flow name, flow status, DND, and FC settings, and changes in the content of existing action campaigns, do not lead to creating new versions of the Flow.
Switching between versions

When you switch between versions, the following happens:

If the current version is not saved, you will be asked if you want to save the changes. If you choose not to save, the version will not be retained, and all the changes will be discarded.
When you switch versions after saving (but the saved version is not published), you'll be notified of the same with the following alert beside the version selector. 

Logs

With the possibility of editing a published flow comes the question What are the changes made, Who made the changes, and when. The following logs will help marketers answer the above questions both for a Version and across multiple versions of a flow:

Version Logs

Version logs are available for the versions of the Flow in the draft state and answer the above three questions to a version. You can access the version logs by clicking the View Changes label at the top ribbon (Flow details section) of the page above the Flows canvas. The following details are available in the version logs:

Unsaved - Details and Dates are available in this section. You can see the details of the changes made to the version listed. Click on the change listed, and you will be shown the node/stage where the change was made, as illustrated in the image below.
Saved - User, Details, and Date are available in this section, as shown below. Also, you can see the details of the changes made to the version.

Audit Logs

Audit logs are available for all versions of the Flow. They contain the following information for each version:

Version - This field indicates the version name of the Flow.
Status - This field indicates the status of the version.
Details - This field contains information about whether the version was published and the list of changes made, has saved changes with a list of changes made, and so on.

Date - This field contains information about when the most recent edit to the version happened.

Finding users who entered a Flow Version

Once you create a new version, you might want to find users who have entered the new version and compare their performance with respect to an older version of the same flow.

You can create a segment with all the users who have performed the User entered flow event with the Flow Id Attribute value being the flow-id of your flow, with the Flow Version Name attribute as the particular version name (For more information, refer to finding the version name for a Flow."

You can Pause, Stop and Retire flows. Scheduled, Completed, and Active is defined by MoEngage.

Edit 

After you publish, the Flow stats on users entering the flow and their performance at every stage are displayed. 

You can only edit an active, scheduled, or paused Flow. The changes will create a new version of the current flow, which can be published or saved. For more information on editing Flows, refer here.

Any change that creates a new version will affect only those users who enter the flow after the new version is published. Existing users will not be affected by the new version. They will continue their trip in the version that is active when they enter.

If there are changes made to a flow that doesn't create a version (like editing the content in the campaigns), the changes are visible to only those users who cross the edited stages post-republishing of the flow. Other users who have already crossed the edited stage before republishing the flow will not be affected by the changes.

Duplicate

Marketers can duplicate an existing Flow by clicking on the duplicate icon in the top right bar or clicking the Actions option on the All Flows Page of an active flow. Also, Marketers can duplicate a Version of a Flow by clicking on the duplicate icon in the top right bar.

This will open a duplicate instance of the already created Flow/ the created version in a new tab which can then be changed, saved, and published.

 

Pause/Resume

An active Flow can be paused by clicking on the Pause option below the flow name.

After you pause, the active flow trip pauses at its current flow stage and won’t advance to the next stage. Due to pause, it might so happen that few users can get indefinitely stuck on any of the Flow stages even after resuming the Flow.

In paused state:

New users will not enter the Flow
No message will be sent
No condition will be evaluated
Users that are already in the Flow will not move to the next step of the flow.

Resume any paused flow. After you resume,  MoEngage starts processing the active flow trip of users from the Flow stages at the time of pausing the flow.

Stop

Published flows are permanently stopped by clicking the Stop option available next to the pause icon.

When stopped, the users in the flow stop at their current stage, and no new users can enter the flow once stopped.  Flow, once stopped, cannot be resumed.

Retiring a Flow 

While stopping the flow, Marketers can choose to allow the users currently in the flow to move forward towards a flow exit while preventing any new entries into the flow. We term it as Retiring a flow. 

This is especially useful while duplicating a flow to add or remove stages from the existing flow. When the duplicated flow is published, ensure to retire the original flow to avoid users entering both flows.

The option to retire the flow will be available after clicking on Actions from the Top Right in your Flows Canvas."

Analyze Flows
Analyze a Flow
Overview

MoEngage Flows provides an intuitive way to analyze user interactions and understand the performance of the flow built. We represent the performance using Trips and a Trip basically represents a unique user journey, beginning with their entry into a flow after fulfilling certain conditions and including their interactions with campaigns and possible conversions along the way.

The analytics of user trip data is crucial for effective user engagement and flow performance optimization. The explained metrics, including Active Trips, Engaged Trips, Converted Trips, Drop-offs, and Revenue among others, offer granular insights into user behaviour and interactions. You can also visualize and filter trip data using the Canvas and Detailed Stats views. Additionally, it sheds light on the performance analysis of individual channels and campaigns, helping you to fine-tune your customer engagement strategies.


info	

Information

All the metrics are calculated and displayed in GMT.

Why Trips?

While tracking the total user entries is an alternative, we identify that auxiliary metrics such as unique user entries and unique conversions are to be tracked and reported every time to remove the ambiguity among the metrics.

As a Trip uniquely identifies each instance a user might enter a flow over the lifetime of a user, it provides an unambiguous concept that can be extended to every metric you would want to track to analyze the performance of your flow.

Definition of Metrics

In every flow, you can see the following top-level metrics:

Metric	Description
Trip Started	The number of trips that have started within a time period. This is the number of times users have entered the flow. 
Active trips	The number of trips out of the total trips that have not yet ended, that is, the number of users that are currently in the flow.
Ended Trips	

Trips that ended already.

Trips Ended = Total Trips - Active Trips


Engaged trips	

The number of trips in which the user received at least one of the action campaigns during their trip. Potentially only engaged trips can lead to a conversion that will be attributed to the flow.

During a trip, if a user receives multiple campaigns before they exit the flow, they would still be counted as part of one engaged trip.

A trip becomes an engaged trip with respect to a channel type when one of the following events is received from the user in the flow trip for the concerned channel. 

Push: Notification Received Android or Notification Received iOS (if iOS delivery tracking is not available, then notification sent iOS event is used to track engagement) 
Email: Email Opened
SMS: SMS Delivered (if delivery is not tracked, then SMS sent)
Connector: Connector Sent
In-App Messaging: Mobile In-App Shown
On-site Messaging: On-site Message Shown
Facebook: Facebook Audience Synced
WhatsApp: WhatApp Message Delivered
Cards: Card Campaign Viewed

Converted trips	

The number of engaged trips that resulted in at least one conversion during the time of the trip. 
If the control group is configured to measure the effectiveness of the flow, then percentage uplift with respect to the control group trip's conversions. 

The formula for CVR is ((Converted Trips)/(Engaged Trips))*100


Total Conversions	

The total number of conversions that are received from all the converted trips.  

For more information about how conversions are tracked and attributed to flows, refer to Conversion Tracking and Attribution in Flows.


Drop-offs	

The total number of trips ended due to the following reasons:

If the Frequency Capping (FC) limit has been reached and the Flow's setting is to remove the user from the flow in case the message has not been sent.
If the message has not been delivered due to Do Not Disturb (DND) and the Flow's setting is to remove the user from the Flow in case the message has not been delivered.
Resuming a paused flow or user entering a Wait For/till stage when the waiting period is already over in the same.
After User Merge, if the known user is already part of the same flow.
Internal errors.

Note: It will be shown only when non-primary goals are viewed or when revenue performance is not tracked with the primary goal.


Revenue	

The cumulative sum of the defined revenue attribute whenever an engaged user performs the goal event.

Revenue Boost

The percentage boost of the engaged test flow users who brought in revenue as compared to the control group users.

The formula for calculating revenue boost is:

((Average revenue of a test flow trip - Average revenue of a control group Trip)/Average revenue of a control group Trip ) x 100

 

If the flow has global control group, then the formula for calculating revenue boost is:
((Average revenue of a test flow trip - Average revenue of a control group Trip & Global control group trip)/Average revenue of a control group Trip & Global control group trip ) x 100

Example

For a flow with action campaigns C1 and C2, User U1 enters the flow and receives both campaigns and converts with the configured conversion goal 2 times. Now, after the user exits the flow, the stats will be:

Total Trips: 1
Active Trips: 0
Engaged Trips: 1 (although the user received both campaigns, it will be treated as one trip)
Converted Trips: 1
Total Conversions:2

Now if User U2 enters the flow but because of some reason (such as personalization failure or not having an active device token) does not receive any of the campaigns but does perform the conversion event once. Now after the user exits the flow, the stats will be:

Total Trips: 2
Active Trips: 0
Engaged Trips: 1 
Converted Trips: 1 
Total Conversions:2

The engaged trip, converted trip, and total conversion do not change because the User U2 was not engaged from either of the flow action campaigns. 

Canvas View

In addition to the overall stats at the top, you can also see the performance of each stage configured in the flow. By filtering for a defined time period, you can understand the behavior or stats of users who have entered the flow within that time.

You can also view the stage level stats to know the number of users that have passed through, or are currently at, or have exited the flow from that stage.

 

info	

Information

Entered = Current + Drop off + Exits for any given stage.

 

The following image shows that 2 users have exited the flow from the Has done event stage. When you hover the mouse over the stage, you will see a pop-up that shows the reason for each exit.

info	

Information

Users can exit from any stage in the flow due to reasons such as:

Passing through an exit stage in the flow path
Fulfilling the conditions in the exit criteria (for more information on adding exit criteria, refer to Global Exit Criteria)
Achieving the conversion goal defined in the flow
Dropping off due to reasons mentioned in the Definition of Metrics section.

 

In addition to analyzing the canvas view for all the user trips, you can analyze and compare the stats/behavior of users who have entered the flow within a defined time period. As shown in the previous image, You can filter the canvas view for the user trips that started within the selected date range.

info	

Information

In canvas view, when you filter for a time period, it shows data for all users who have entered the flow in the specified time period. The detailed stats show data of what has happened during that time period regardless of when the user entered the flow. For more information, refer here.

If you want to see the updated stats for the active trips, click the Refresh icon next to the date range filter to update both the overall and stage-level stats.

Conversion Uplift

Uplift is only shown in overall stats if the control group was enabled for at least a day during the filtered period. To know more about how uplift is calculated, click here.

Legends

The colors in the canvas represent the flow path and the decisions made to send campaigns to your customers.

The following table describes the legends on the canvas:

Legend	Description

Detailed Stats

You can open the detailed stats page for your flow by clicking the ""Stats"" tab adjacent to the ""Flows"" tab.

info	

Information

The detailed stats are shown for the last 90 days by default or since the current version's published time, whichever is shorter. You can see the stats from the time the flow was published using the date range filter.

Flow Performance

The stats of the currently active version of the Flow are loaded in this section. You can see the stats of any specific version by selecting the version from the version selector as shown in the following image. You can choose the following in the version selector:

Specific Version: This section shows you the trends of User trips, Engaged Trips, and Converted trips over time for the selected Version. If the control group is enabled during the filtered time, the conversion uplift is also shown.

All Versions: The All Versions option loads the cumulative stats for all versions put together. The Flow Performance for All Versions has information about User Trips, Engaged Trips, and Converted Trips and Conversions over time. If the control group is enabled during the filtered time, the conversion uplift is also shown. Revenue performance is not available in the All Versions option, because each version might have a different revenue attribute or currency. The chart also shows when each version was published.


While the default view is the overall period of the flow and the defined primary goal at the time when the flow is published, you can filter out the stats:

For a particular time period based on the dates.
Based on the conversion goals.
info	

Note

Are your control group trips more than the defined percentage, or is there a negative uplift? Refer to the uplift calculation and CG Allotment for more information.

Drop-Offs and Exits

This section has the following tabs:

Drops - This tab lists reasons for all drop-offs, an explanation for each drop-off reason, the total drop-offs due to this reason, and the percentage of all drop-offs. When you expand a drop-off reason, you will see the stage type and stage name from which users were dropped off.

Exits - This tab lists reasons for all exits, an explanation for each exit reason, the total exits due to this reason, and the percentage of all exits. When you expand an exit reason, you will see the stage type and stage name from which users exited.
This tab also shows Exit on conversion. You can see stats of users who exited the flow on achieving the conversion goal defined in the flow.

Business Events

This section helps you analyze the flow performance for each Business Event instance. When you expand the Business Event, you can see the impact of each instance separately on a day level.  For more information, refer to the Definition of Metrics.


Engagement Trends

This section helps you to analyze the aggregate channel performances of all channels that are used in the flow. 

You can select the channel you want to analyze from the list of channels from the drop-down list. The four major aggregated metrics of the overall channel performance can be directly compared with the overall flow stats, as in the following image:

Push
Email
SMS
Connector
OSM and In-App
WhatsApp
Facebook Audience
Cards
Google Ads
Metric	Description
Sent	Sent is the total number of users for whom the request was successfully accepted to be sent by the FCM/APNS services.
Impression	Impressions represent the total number of user devices that have received the notification sent by the marketer.
Clicks (CTR)	

Clicks represent the total number of notifications clicked by the users after the notification delivery. CTR is the percentage ratio between Total Clicks and Total Impressions.

CTR = (Total Clicks/Total Impression )*100


Conversion (CVR)	

Conversions represent the number of unique users who have completed the conversion event. CVR is the percentage ratio between Conversions and Unique Impressions.

CVR  = (Unique Conversions/Unique Impressions)*100


Revenue	Revenue represents the sum of the total order value of conversion events.
Campaign Stats

This section lists the performance of all action campaigns configured in the flow. This can help you compare the individual campaigns across channels. If required, you can choose to filter the action campaigns of one particular channel to understand and compare the performance of similar campaigns. 

info	

Information

You cannot add the metrics in each row of the Campaign Stats table and compare it with flow-level metrics because this table shows each campaign's performance and thus will have overlapped attribution across campaigns. For example, the sum of unique conversions can be different from converted trips and conversions at the overall flow level. For more information, refer here.

Metrics	Description
Total User Entries	The count of users the campaign tried to deliver the message. It includes the control group users that might have passed through the campaign during their trip and all the users that the campaigns failed to deliver because of any of the failure reasons.
Sent	The count of messages that were successfully sent eventually.
Delivered	Tracked for SMS. The Total Delivered for a campaign is shown here. Also the Delivered rate is shown.

Opened	

Tracked for email. The Unique opens is shown here. Also the Open rate is shown in case of emails.

You can also view the Adjusted opens here. To know more, refer to Adjusted Opens under Engagement trends.



Impression	Tracked for Push, OSM, and InApp. The Total impressions for a campaign is shown here. Also the percentage ratio between the Total Impression & Total Sents is shown.
Sync	Tracked for Facebook and Google Audience. The Total Synced for a campaign is shown here.
Read	Tracked for WhatsApp. The Total Read for the campaign is shown here.
Clicks	The total clicks and the CTR are shown for the campaigns here.

Flows - Cross Channel Messaging 
Analyze Flows
Conversion Attribution in Flows
What is an Attribution Window?

An attribution widow is the time period that is calculated since the user last engaged with a communication from the flow, that is, viewing a communication.

For a specific user trip in the flow, the attribution window starts when the customer gets engaged by an action campaign and ends when the defined attribution window gets over from the action campaign that the customer engaged with finally.

In the following example, Track above goal for is set as 36 hours. This is the attribution window for the flow.

How Does MoEngage Attribute Conversion to Flows?

By default MoEngage attributes users doing the defined goal event within the attribution window from the time the user saw the communication as ""Conversions"".

You can choose any event tracked in MoEngage as a conversion goal activity and set more than one conversion goal in a flow. The first goal will be treated as a primary goal. For example, if you want to track the number of customers who have purchased an iPhone after your campaign was sent. Your conversion goal setup might look as it is shown in the previous image.

The flow conversions will be the share of the unique user entries that performed the conversion goal within the attribution window after viewing/engaging any of the Flow Action campaign messages during their flow trip. All conversions attributed to flows will be influenced by at least one of the Action campaigns of the flow, and all conversions of the Action campaigns will be attributed to flows.

info	

Information

When the Exit on conversion toggle is on, MoEngage forcefully exits users from the flow as soon as they convert with the primary conversion goal. The number of users who have been forcefully exited is also available at every stage. In the case shown in the following image, 4 users have been forcefully exited from the flow at the last stage because their primary conversion goal has been achieved and the Exit on conversion toggle was on.

Examples

Assuming that the following flow is configured with the event ""Product Purchased"" as the conversion goal for the flow and the attribution window is set as 2 hours. The ""Has Received push"" condition is evaluated for 2 hours.  

Scenario 1

The user enters the flow at 1:00 PM on Day D1, but the message is not delivered until 3:01 PM for some reason. Hence the user is sent the Push 2 campaign at 3:02 and then exits the flow by 3:03 PM. Eventually, both messages are delivered at 3:10 PM. The user purchases a product at 4:15 PM. 

Now, both the Action campaign's conversion and conversion event will increase by 1 each. Also the Flow Converted Trips will increase by 1 and the flow conversions will increase by 1. This is because the attribution window for both the Push campaigns were until 5:10 PM and the user did the goal event within this period.

Scenario 2

The user enters the flow at 1:00 PM on Day D1, but the message is not delivered till 3:01 PM for some reason. Hence the user is sent the Push 2 campaign at 3:02 and then exits the flow by 3:03 PM. Eventually, Push 1 and Push 2 are delivered at 3:10 PM and 4:00 PM respectively. The user purchases a product at 5:30 PM and 6:00 PM.

Now, the Conversion and Flow Converted Trips of Push 2 will increase by 1, while Push 1 Conversion will not be increased. This is because the user converted time is outside of the attribution window for Push 1, but is within the attribution window of Push 2. Flow Conversions and the conversion event metric of Push 2 will be incremented by 2 because the user did conversion event 2 times within the attribution window.

Types of Attribution

There are three types of attributions for every conversion goal, and they are:

View through
 
Click through
In session

View through attribution refers to the users whose conversions are attributed to their having completed the goal after having viewed a campaign such as Push, Email, SMS.

In the following image, there are 16 conversions that are attributed to the view through attribution type because out of the 17 users who have entered this flow, 16 have seen and converted."

Debug Flows
Overview

Marketers often seek information about why a user moved along a particular path in a Flow, where they are in the Flow currently, or whether they entered the Flow. With Debug Flows, marketers can understand why a published flow is behaving the way it is.

Debug Flows helps them understand the exact path that users are traversing in a published flow by following the journey of a particular target user. This helps them understand why the engagement for a specific campaign in a Flow wasn't optimal or helps them understand why a user behaved a certain way. 
Debug Flows is a feature that helps a marketer trace a user's path in a Flow. This helps validate the performance of a published flow, understand whether flow settings and set-up, such as entry criteria, triggers, and scheduling, are configured correctly, and also helps understand drop-off points or conversions within a specific user or cohort.

Using Debug Flows, one can understand the following:

Why a user did not enter a flow, even after performing a trigger event.
After entering a flow, why a user did not receive a campaign.
Once a user has entered the flow - understand the path the user has followed, how the user has engaged with the flow, and where the user has converted or dropped off.

How can you use Debug Flows?
Understanding why your flow is not performing as per expectations 

You published a flow; however, viewing your analytics, you realize that the audiences who are receiving the campaign are not the intended audience. Using Debug Flows - you can understand why these audiences were part of the flow and take corrective action accordingly.

Test the flow for yourself before publishing it for the larger segment/audience 

You are running a multi-channel customer journey across a large set of audiences. However, before publishing the campaign for the entire segment, you would like to publish it for a smaller set of users (or internal team members) and test it out. With Debug Flows, you can understand the flow performance for the smaller audience set by ‘Shadowing users”, optimize the flow, and accordingly publish the same for a larger audience.

Debug a flow yourself 

You have published a flow. However, users are not engaging with the flow as expected. Debug Flows can be used to understand the gaps in the flow setup and make relevant changes.

How does Debug Flows work?
info	

Note

Debug Flows is not available for Fixed Time Flows that is, One-time or Periodic Flows.

 

To debug a user trip:

Navigate to the All Flows Page.
Select the required Flow by clicking on it.
Navigate to the Debug Flows tab.
In the Search user entry search bar, select the user identifier - ID or MoEngageID in the dropdown. For more information, refer to User Identifiers.
Specify the ID or MoEngageID of the user for whom you want to debug the user trips.
Press Enter. This will populate all the attempts and entries of the user in the Flow for its various versions in the User Entry dropdown.
You can specify a date range to select the attempts/entries of the user between a specific timeframe by clicking the  (filter icon) and specifying the date range in the date field. The options available are Yesterday, Last Week, Last Month, and Custom Range. Note: You cannot look back at a date range greater than 30 days from the current date for debugging.
Select the entry or attempt that you wish to look at in the User Entry dropdown and click Debug.

Terms to Know
Term	Description
Entry	Entry denotes that the user has entered the Flow after meeting the entry condition set for the Flow.
Attempt	

Attempt denotes that the user was considered for the Flow but did not enter the Flow as they failed to meet all the parameters set in the entry condition for the Flow. Also, users may not be allowed to enter the Flow even if they meet all the entry conditions if the user entry limit is already met.

Note: If a user belongs to the specified target segment for a Event Triggered Flow but does not perform the primary event associated with the trigger condition, they would not be considered for the Flow at all and thus would not have any attempts.


Entry/Attempt Number	Each attempt and entry is labeled entry 'x' or attempt 'x' depending on the number of times the user qualifies for the flow. For example, Entry 1 is the first time the user entered the flow, and attempt 5 represents the 5th failed attempt of a user to enter the flow.
Status	This field indicates the status of an action tied to the stage or the status of a condition. For example, for a campaign attached to a stage, the status would be sent or not sent depending on whether the campaign was sent to the user successfully or not.
Locale	This field indicates the locale associated with the child campaign of the flow.
Variant	This field indicates the variant of the child campaign that the user has been assigned to in the flow.
Entry	This field indicates the date and time at which the user entered the stage.
Exit	This field indicates the date and time at which the user exited the stage.
Selected Channel	This field indicates the channel selected for Next Best Action.
Evaluation Start Time	This field indicates the time at which the user was evaluated for a particular condition in a flow.
Evaluation End Time	This field indicates the time at which the user evaluation ended for a particular condition in a flow.
Defined Conditions	This field indicates the criteria specified for a condition stage in a flow.
Traversed Branch	This field indicates the branch traversed by the user for an Intelligent Path Optimizer (IPO) or A/B split flow.
Time Zone	This field indicates the time zone chosen when specifying the Wait for/till control. This could either be the App or the User timezone.
Time Slots	This field indicates the time slot chosen for the Wait for/till control. For example, you can choose to move users to the next stage every Monday at 6 PM. This information would be available under the Time Slots field.
Duration	This field indicates the time duration chosen for the Wait for/till control. For example, you can choose to move users to the next stage after 'x' hours of arriving at the Wait for/till stage.
Viewing Information About a Stage/Action

To view the information about a stage or action, or condition, click on the stage, and you will get the details about it on the left of the canvas. For example, if there is an email campaign attached to a Flow and user has moved through that stage, you can click on the campaign and see its status, locale, and variant information, along with when the user entered and exited that stage.

Stage	Information Available for when a user enters the stage	Information Available for when a user does not qualify for a stage or when the user does not enter a stage
Campaigns	For every campaign in the Flow, you can view the status, locale, variant, and entry/ exit information.	For a campaign that wasn't delivered to the user, the entry/exit information and the reason why the campaign wasn't delivered to the user are shown.
Condition Stage	For a condition stage, you can view the Status, evaluation start time, evaluation ending time, defined conditions, and entry/exit information.	For a condition stage, the information about which condition the user didn't meet(has done an event or user attribute check or criteria for conditional split) and the entry/exit information will be available.
NBA	For the NBA stage, you can view the status, selected channel, locale, variant, and entry/ exit information.	For an NBA stage, the entry/exit information and the reason why the campaign wasn't delivered to the user are shown.
Wait Till/For	For a Wait Till/For stage, you can view the time zone and time slots/duration information and entry/exit information.	

For a wait till/for stage, entry/exit information would be shown.

For example, a user will be dropped at the wait for/till stage if they entered the wait for/till stage after the defined time slot has elapsed. If the time slot defined is May 25th, 2023, at 6:00 PM, and the user enters and arrives at the Wait for/till node on May 28th, 2023, at 4 PM, they will be dropped, and this information will be available.




A/B Split/IPO

	For a Flow with AB Split/IPO, you can view the branch that was traversed by the user and the entry/exit information.	For an A/B split or IPO control node, the branch and the entry/exit information of the specific branch that the user dropped off from are shown.


GoTo

	For a GoTo condition, you can view the source stage, destination stage, and entry/exit information.	For a GoTo control node, the entry/exit information is shown.
Trip summary

The trip summary section provides information about when the user started the trip and when they exited the flow. The following details are available:

Trip start - this field indicates when the user entered the flow.
Trip converted - this field indicates whether the user has converted within the trip or not.
Trip end - this field indicates when the user exited the flow.
Trip end reason - this field indicates why the user exited the flow. A user could have exited the flow because of one of the following reasons:
Trip end reason	Description


Dropped out due to DND/FC settings

	

The user exited the flow as the frequency capping limit was exceeded or the communication was attempted to be sent during the DND window for the flow, and the Flow setting is defined to remove the user. Click here to learn more.




Dropped out due to Technical Exception

	The user exited the flow as there were internal system errors.


Dropped out as Flow was Inactive (Paused/Stopped/Retired)

	The user exited the flow as it was paused, stopped, or retired.


Exited as User converted

	The user exited as the conversion goals set for the flow were met.


User entered post the Waiting period of the Wait Stage

	The user exited the flow as they entered after the Wait For/Till time had elapsed.


Exited via Exit Stage

	The user exited the flow as they reached the exit stage.


Dropped due to user merge

	The user was exited from the flow as they were merged into a registered user's account. For more details, refer to User Merging.
Trip end stage - this field indicates at which the user exited the flow.

Tracking Users in Flows
Tracking Users Who Entered a Flow

To identify users who have entered a flow, you can segment the users who have performed the ""User Entered Flow"" event. The event is tracked for each entry done by a user.

Below are some examples:

Segment Entered User	Event Attributes to be Used	Description
By a flow	Flow Id or Flow Name	By filtering using Flow Id, you can find the list of unique users whose conversion was attributed to this flow.
By a particular version	Version Name	By filtering using Version Name, you can find the list of unique users whose conversion was attributed to this version of the flow.
By user type	With control group 	By filtering using With control group = True, you can find the list of users who entered the flow as Control Group (both Global and Flow). By filtering using With Control Group = False, you an find the list of users who entered the flow as Target Group.
By Control Group Type	Control Group Type	By filtering using Control Type Group = Flow, you can find the list of users who entered the flow as Control Group. By filtering using Control Type Group = Global, you can find the list of users who entered the flow as Global Control Group.

Information

You can find the Flow Id for your campaign by opening your flow in a new window and copying the string that follows /flows/ from URL. For example, 6616a9259670a17eec8b7c65 is the Flow ID in the following image:

Tracking Users Who Converted

To identify users who have performed the conversion goal event after receiving one of the Flow Action campaigns (that is, converted users), you can segment the users who have performed the ""Flow Trip conversion"". 


The event is tracked for each conversion, so if a user performs the conversion multiple times during their flow trip, this event will be raised for each recorded conversion and also for each of the defined goals. 

You can identify the users who have converted for a particular flow or a particular action campaign.

Below are some examples:

Segment Converted User	Event Attribute to be Used	Description
By a flow 	Flow Id or Flow Name	By filtering using Flow Id, you can find the list of unique users whose conversion was attributed to this flow.
By a particular version	Version Name	By filtering using Version Name, you can find the list of unique users whose conversion was attributed to this version of the flow.
By a particular flow Action Campaign	Flow Action Campaign Id	By filtering using the Campaign Id, you can find the list of unique users whose conversion was attributed to this campaign of the flow.
By a particular flow goal event	Flow Conversion Event or Goal Name	By filtering using the Goal Name,  you can find the list of unique users who converted by doing this event.
By a particular attribution type	Attribution Type	By filtering using the Attribution Type, you can find the list of unique users who converted as per the specific attribution logic.
For all control group users	User Type	By filtering using the User Type = Control Group, you can find the list of unique control group users who converted.
For all non-control group users	User Type	By filtering using the User Type = Targeted, you can find the list of unique control group users who converted.
Tracking Users Who Exited a Flow

To identify users who have exited from a flow, you can segment the users who have performed the ""User Exited Flow"".

The event is tracked for each exit done by a user. You can identify a user who has exited a flow with related filters such as exited on conversion, completing a certain flow, and so on. 

Below are some examples:

Segment Exited user	Event Attributes to be Used	Description
By a flow	Flow Id or Flow Name	By filtering using Flow Id, you can find the list of unique users whose conversion was attributed to this flow.
By a particular version	Version Name	By filtering using Version Name, you can find the list of unique users whose conversion was attributed to this version of the flow.
By a particular stage	Stage Id or Stage Name	By filtering using Stage Id, you can find the list of unique users who exited the flow through that stage.
By a particular exit reason	Exit Reason	By filtering using Exit Reason, you can find the list of unique users who exited the flow due to a specific reason.
By user type	With control group	By filtering using With control group = True, you can find the list of users who entered the flow as Control Group (both Global and Flow). By filtering using With control group = False, you can find the list of users who entered the flow as Target Group.

Flows - Cross Channel Messaging 
FAQs
Why Are Users Being Incorrectly Evaluated at the Global Exit Criteria?
Problem

Users are getting inaccurately evaluated at the global exit criteria.

Explanation
When creating a process flow and adding global exit criteria to verify an event, identify the starting point of the flow to find the corresponding trigger event.
Whenever users activate this trigger event, they automatically enter the flow.
Consequently, if the global exit criteria confirms the presence of the user in the flow, they will proceed through it and eventually exit.
Example
For instance, you configure global exit criteria to ensure users exit the flow if they perform a specific event, transaction_success_s2s.
However, all users are incorrectly evaluated as true for the global exit criteria, even if they had not performed the event Since entering the flow.
Solution
To resolve the issue, change the evaluation option from Since entering the flow  to Since exiting the previous node and increase the evaluation time."

FAQs
Why Do Users Receive Both Versions of A/B Split Campaigns in a Flow?
Problem

Users are receiving both versions of A/B split campaigns in a Flow.

Explanation
Users who enter and exit a flow multiple times will receive all eligible versions of the split until the flow stops.
However, an issue arises when two identical versions of the split are active without delay between campaigns.
In this situation, if both versions of the split have the same trigger condition, users are expected to enter and exit both versions of the split.
Since the campaigns are evenly split (50:50), users have a random chance of receiving either campaign each time they enter the flow.
Solution

Avoid using identical flows or the Maximum times to show message ever feature. These restrict the campaign from being shown a maximum number of times as defined during campaign creation."

FAQs
Why Do Users Get Incorrectly Evaluated at Event Check?
Problem

Users exit the flow despite successfully performing the desired event at an event check or conditional split node.

Solution
When defining the evaluation window at check nodes or conditional split nodes, ensure that end users have sufficient time to perform the since entering the flow or since exiting the last stage check event.
If the time window provided is too short, end users are likely to exit the flow prematurely.
Example
If the flow entry condition is Add To Cart, and the event check is for the Purchase event, it is unrealistic to expect all end users who add products to their cart to purchase within a 5-minute evaluation period after entering the flow.
The time between adding a product to the cart and purchasing can range from a few hours to several days. Therefore, setting a realistic evaluation period for the event check is essential."

Why Are Users Evaluated Inaccurately for the “All User” Flows?
Problem

A user base consisting of All users or custom segments was used as the flow entry condition, with several exclude conditions. Users were evaluated even though they fulfilled the excluded conditions.

Solution
All user segments are evaluated in real-time without any refresh time.
When filters are added to the All User segment, they are treated as a custom segment. Therefore, custom segments that depend on user attributes may require up to three hours to refresh and include all users."

FAQs
Why Do Users Fail To Enter the Flow Despite Performing the Trigger Event?
Problem

Unable to enter the flow even after performing the trigger event.

Explanation

When using events or user attributes as filter conditions, the actions performed by the user must match the filters set by the marketer. Mismatched values or data types will result in incorrect evaluation.

Example
For instance, the expected filters specify an Add To Cart event with five items in the cart.
The received filters specify an Add To Cart event with two items in the cart, which means only data entries for the items in the cart will be considered valid."

FAQs
Why Did Users Drop Off from a Specific Wait Node in a Flow?
Problem

All users who entered the flow were observed to drop off exclusively from a particular wait node.

Explanation
When users are in the waiting stage, and the flow is paused, they will not progress when the wait timer expiry event occurs, causing them to remain stuck in that stage indefinitely.
Similarly, if a user is waiting at a stage and the flow is paused before the time frame is selected in the <Wait for/till> node, MoEngage will remove the user from the flow, categorizing them as drop-offs.
Solution

The flow was likely paused, so check the audit logs at Settings > Account > Audit Logs to confirm this."

FAQs
Creation of Flows
What are some good practices to follow while creating a flow?
In your onboarding flows where the trigger event is Install/ Sign up/ or any event that creates a profile for the users, please always have Target Audience as ""All users"". If this is not possible, add ID exists as the condition. This setup will help you escape the refresh frequency and the update of these values will be close to realtime even while profile creation.
Avoid using Wait Stages just before Condition Stages like Has done event, Conditional Splits. Instead, define the same period in the Keep evaluating for within the condition stages. This helps in dynamically moving users using the concerned branch with context.
Copy-paste stages to avoid manual work when the configuration of stages is going to be pretty much the same by hovering over stages.
Use Personalisation in Campaigns to improve the performance.
Use Exit on Conversion to remove users when they are no longer contextual to the flow to avoid spamming users.
How do you personalize within a flow?

To personalize within a flow:

Type @ in the message fields of the point channel campaigns (Push, SMS, Email, and so on). The personalization editor is displayed.
You can personalize the message with user attributes and event attributes.
Event-based personalization is only possible in Event-triggered Flows or in Communications that are added under the Yes Branch of Condition stages.
How does a new version get created in a flow, and how does it affect existing users?

A new version of a flow is created when there is a change in one or more of the following:

Target Audience Condition
Entry Condition
Tracked Conversion Goals
Addition or Deletion of a stage to the canvas, and so on.

When the flow is published, the new version becomes active, and the previous version is retired. All the active users in the previous version of the flow will continue their trips in that version. New users in the flow will move to the new version (if they are not active in any of the previous versions).

For more information, refer to Versioning in Flows.

How do you stop users from re-entering a flow?

To stop users from re-entering or to define a limit on the number of entries, add the user entry limit in the second step of the flow creation. Specify the user entry limit in the When users enter the flow step.

What does Keep Evaluating For mean? How does it work?

The Keep Evaluating For option is available in stages where conditions are added. It denotes the maximum time period for which users are evaluated on the defined checks in the condition stages. This window is dynamic, as users can leave via the Yes path as and when they satisfy the defined conditions. This dynamic evaluation helps you in timing your communications better and in context.

Consider the following example in a flow that targets users who've abandoned their carts (the flow's audience would be users who have added products to their cart but have yet to make a purchase). The Flow has the following stages:

a Push Notification stage
a Has done event stage - defined as Has Executed Product Purchase at least 1 time and this stage will keep evaluating users who've entered it for an hour.

John is a user who:

Enters the flow at 10 AM
Receives the first push notification and enters the Has done stage at 10:10 AM.

Since this stage will evaluate John for an hour, he will be evaluated for the specified conditions until 11:10 AM and will either move in the Yes path or the No path of the stage.

The following scenarios can happen:

If John had performed the event at 10:09 AM, he will move out of the stage along the Yes path as soon as he enters.
If John performs the event at 11:00 AM, he will wait until 11:00 AM in the stage and move along the Yes path at 11:00 AM.
If John performs the event at 12:00 PM, he will wait until 11:10 AM in the stage and move along the No path as he did not satisfy the criteria specified for the stage during the evaluation window.
How are users evaluated in the Condition Split Stage in a flow?

In the Condition Split Stage of a flow, users are assessed based on the conditions outlined in the first branch throughout the entire evaluation window. If a user meets those conditions, they are directed down Branch 1.

If they do not satisfy the conditions, MoEngage waits until the end of the evaluation window to ascertain if the user ever does match the conditions within Branch 1 during the defined period. After that, MoEngage considers all alternate branches in the conditional split, and users are directed through the path where they first matched the defined conditions.

The evaluation process involves prioritizing the branches in the conditional split. As such, the first branch has the highest priority, and the priority decreases for each subsequent branch. The default branch has the least priority in this regard.

Consider the following example in a flow that targets users who've abandoned their carts (the flow's audience would be users who have added products to their cart but have yet to make a purchase). The Flow has a Conditional Split with the following branches:

Branch 1 - splits users who have wishlisted Electronics to their cart. This branch has the highest priority.
Branch 2 - splits users who have wishlisted Fashion items to their cart. This branch has the second highest priority.
Default branch - allows every other user. This stage is defined to keep evaluating for ten minutes.
a Has done event stage - defined as Has Executed Product Purchase at least 1 time and this stage will keep evaluating users who've entered it for an hour.

John is a user who:

Enters the flow at 10 AM
Reaches the conditional split stage at 10 AM
Can move to any of the branches within ten minutes

Consider the following scenarios:

If John has wishlisted both Fashion and Electronics at 10:05 AM and at 10:06 AM respectively, he will move along Branch 1 as it has the highest priority at 10:06 AM.
If John has wishilisted Fashion at 10:08 AM, he will be evaluated for Branch 1 till 10:10 AM as Branch 1 has the highest priority. As he does not satisfy Branch 1's condition, he will be evaluated for Branch 2 and the Default branch at 10:10 AM. If he satisfies Branch 2's condition, he will move along Branch 2 at 10:10 AM as it has the second highest priority.
If John does not wishlist any thing till 10:10 AM, he will be evaluated for Branch 1 till 10:10 AM as Branch 1 has the highest priority. As he does not satisfy Branch 1's condition, he will be evaluated for Branch 2 and the Default branch at 10:10 AM. As he does not satisfy Branch 2's condition, he will move along the Default Branch at 10:10 AM."

FAQs
Editing Flows
Editing Content or Changing the Wait Time of a Published Flow

Edits made to flows will only impact users who enter the stage after the update goes live. For instance, if content is modified in a Push stage, only those users who enter this stage after the update will receive push notifications with the updated content. Previous users who have passed this stage will still receive push notifications with the old content.

In the same way, if there is a change made in the wait duration or slot, only those users who enter the stage after the update will be subject to the revised waiting period.

Pausing a Flow

When a Flow is paused, all users remain in their respective stages, and no new evaluation occurs. Inbound and outbound campaigns are also paused at this point. Users will only be dropped from the paused flow when they move from a Condition or Wait stage after the defined waiting period.

Note: A paused Flow can be resumed by the user at any time.

Stopping a Flow

When a Flow is stopped, all active users are pushed out of the Flow from their specific stages, and all inbound and outbound campaigns will stop.

Note: Once a Flow is stopped, this action cannot be undone.

Retiring a Flow

When a Flow is retired, no new entries will be processed for that Flow. However, all active trips will continue to move through the Flow as usual, and any campaigns associated with the Flow will remain active and be shown to users until all active trips have reached the end of the Flow.

Once all active trips are completed and there are no users left in the Flow, all child campaigns associated with the Flow will also be stopped.

Note: Once a Flow is retired, this action cannot be undone.

When does an InApp/OSM campaign stop?

In-app and OSM campaigns will automatically stop when the campaign expiration date passes, or when the associated Flow is stopped. Additionally, if a Flow is retired, all active trips within that Flow are zero."

FAQs
Analyzing Flows
Metrics, Drop-Off, and Failure Reasons
What are the various metrics or stats tracked for Flows?

Flow metrics are available at the top of the canvas for a published Flow. For more information about the various metrics, refer to Flow Stats.

What does drop-off mean?

Drop-offs occur when an user trip ends abruptly within a flow. There are various reasons why this might happen, including: 

If the Frequency Capping (FC) limit has been reached and the Flow's setting is to remove the user from the flow in case the message has not been sent.
If the message has not been delivered due to Do Not Disturb settings and the Flow's setting is to remove the user from the Flow in case the message has not been delivered.
Resuming a paused flow or user entering a Wait For/till stage when the waiting period is already over.
If the known user is already part of the same flow after a merge with another user.
If some internal error occurs while the Flow is being executed.
What is the difference between drop-offs & Exits?

Drop-offs occur when an user trip ends abruptly within a flow out of Marketer's control. While Exits occur when an user trip ends due to the defined conditions like Exit Conditions.

Where can I find the failure reasons for campaigns that were not sent?

To identify the reasons for each channel's underperformance, navigate to the Channel Performance section under the Stats tab in your Flows. For campaign-level insights, access the Campaign Info page by either clicking the i icon that appears when hovering above a campaign stage in the canvas or clicking on the campaign name in the Campaign Performance section found under the Stats tab in your Flows.

Why are we using Trips and not unique counts?

Trips provide an unambiguous way of tracking and analyzing flow metrics by uniquely identifying each instance when a user enters a flow throughout their lifetime. Although total user entries can also be monitored, tracking auxiliary metrics such as unique user entries and unique conversions is necessary to remove ambiguity in the metrics and provide accurate reporting. As a result, trips are more relevant and useful to understand the performance of a flow.

Conditional Stages
How are users evaluated in the Condition Stages within Flows?

As users enter condition stages, they are evaluated based on the defined window. If a user meets the condition during this evaluation window, they are moved along the ""Yes Path"" immediately. The ""Keep Evaluating for"" window is the maximum time allowed for evaluation, and it is dynamic, so users who do not perform the event within the entire evaluation period are redirected to the ""No Path"" at the end.

Note: This dynamic evaluation nature improves communication timing and provides better context.

How are users evaluated in the Condition Split stage within Flows?

Users are evaluated for the conditions defined in the first branch during the entire defined evaluation window. If they meet the requirements, they move along to Branch 1. However, if they do not meet the requirements, we wait for the entire evaluation window to see if the same user satisfies the conditions in Branch 1 at any point during this duration.

After the evaluation period, we consider all the other branches' paths where the user meets the conditions. This prioritization is necessary because the conditional branches have a priority hierarchy, with Branch 1 having the highest precedence and the default branch having the lowest.

Control Groups and Uplifts
How does the Control Group uplift work?

Uplift is a metric that enables you to evaluate your performance concerning organic behavior by analyzing Control Group users. Conversion uplift represents the percentage ratio of the difference between Target Group Conversion and Control Group Conversion. For more information, refer to Control Groups in Flows.

How does conversion get attributed for both Control Group and Target Group users?

The Trips of converted users refer to those who have reached the specified goal within the defined attribution window following their previous engagement with Flows' communication. Control Group (CG) users are considered engaged by default since they do not receive communication. The criteria for conversion applies to both types of users, and users who do not meet these conditions will not be attributed to Flows.

To identify the unique users who have converted, you can query for Has Executed Flow Trip Conversion with Flow ID as the attribute in segmentation. For more information, refer to Conversion Attribution in Flows. 

Why am I not seeing uplift metrics?

Uplift metrics on CVR are shown only when the Control Group (CG) trips have happened for at least 24 hours.

What should I do when the uplift is negative?

If Control Group (CG) users are converting more than the targeted users, the uplift metric will be negative. To improve this situation, experiment with the communication content using A/B split stages or Variations within campaigns. Additionally, prioritizing high-performing channels at the top of the flow can be effective.

Moreover, using NBA in Flows to experiment with the timing of message delivery can improve the chances of converting users since NBA identifies the preferred channel and the best time to send the communication to every user.

How do I find Control Group users from the users who entered and users who converted?

To find users belonging to the Control Group, segment using the ""User Entered Flow"" option and filter by the ""Flow ID"" attribute and the ""With Control Group"" attribute. For more information, refer to Control Group Users for a Flow.

To identify converted users from the Control Group, segment using the ""Flow Trip Conversion"" and filter by the ""Flow ID"" attribute and ""User Type"" attribute. For more information, refer to Tracking Converted Users for a Flow.

Low Stats
Why is my Total Trips metric low?

For a user to enter the flow,  they must execute the trigger event while belonging to the defined Target Audience Segment and fulfilling other conditions like entry limits (if specified in the Flow). Moreover, the user should not be part of an active trip in the Flow at the time of consideration for entry.

When event-based or custom Segment-based checks define the Target Audience, the segment refreshes once every three hours. As a result, newly added users will only re-enter the Flow if they meet the trigger condition again.

If the Total Trips metric appears too low, consider avoiding event-based or custom segment-based checks to define your Target Audience. Incorporate these checks inside the Flow as the first step after the Entry stage to avoid losing any users.

Why is my Conversion metric low?

If your Conversion Metrics appear low, it could be because the count of converted trips may be less than the count of users who performed the events you were tracking. Only users who performed the event within the attribution window after engaging with any communication sent from Flows are counted for conversion.

Users who never engaged but performed the goal event and users who performed the goal event after engaging outside the attribution window will not be considered. Therefore, they won't be included in the conversion count, which may cause the metrics to dip.

Why is my Total Trips metric zero?

The maximum time allowed for a flow to start receiving entries depends on the target audience's definition:

If the target audience is defined using ""All users"" or user property checks, the maximum time is 10 minutes.
If the target audience is defined using other checks, the maximum time is 60 minutes, and the segment refreshes within 60 mins. Any users not included will join after 3 hours.

Therefore, if the elapsed time since publishing is within these SLAs, wait for the flow to process entries. If the deadline has passed, use the Visualize user trip feature to determine why eligible users have not entered. For more information, refer to Visualize User Trips.

Count Difference in Stats within Flows and between Segmentation and Flows
Why is my sum of Unique Conversions different from Converted Trips and Conversions?

A Converted Trip is a unique user trip that engaged with a communication from a flow and executed a conversion goal event within the defined attribution window. However, this metric is unique only at the flow level. For example, if a user (A) converts twice in one trip, their converted trip will be 1, but conversions will be 2. For more information, refer to Conversion Attribution.

It's not possible to sum the conversions listed in campaign stages and match them at the flow level because there will be overlaps in attribution. For instance, consider a flow with two push stages, PN1 and PN2, and a Wait Till stage for two hours between them. The Flow's attribution window is 36 hours.

John is a user who:

Enters the flow at 11:30 AM
Engages with PN1 at 12:00 PM
Does not engage with PN2
Converts at 8 PM.

The conversion metrics for this scenario are as follows:

Metric	Level (Flow/Campaign)	Count
Converted Trips	Flow	1
Conversions	Flow	1
Conversions	Push Campaign PN1	1
Conversion Events	Push Campaign PN1	1
Conversions	Push Campaign PN2	0 (John did not engage with PN2)
Conversion Events	Push Campaign PN2	0 (John did not engage with PN2)

Jane is a user who:

Enters the flow at 11:45 AM
Receives PN1 and engages with it at 12 PM
Receives PN1 and engages with it at 3 PM
Converts at 9 PM.

The conversion metrics for this scenario where both John and Jane are in the flow are as follows:

Metric	Level (Flow/Campaign)	Count
Converted Trips	Flow	2 (1 each for John and Jane)
Conversions	Flow	2 (1 each for John and Jane)
Conversions	Push Campaign PN1	2 (1 each for John and Jane, as the conversion has been done within the attribution window of both PN1 and PN2)
Conversion Events	Push Campaign PN1	2 (1 each for John and Jane, as the conversion has been done within the attribution window of both PN1 and PN2)
Conversions	Push Campaign PN2	1 (only Jane converted for PN2 as she engaged with it while John did not)
Conversion Events	Push Campaign PN2	1 (only Jane converted for PN2 as she engaged with it while John did not)

The sum of Conversions in PN1 and PN2 will be greater than Converted Trips because of the overlap in attribution for Jane.

Why are my Converted trips stats not matching with the count of users going through the Yes path in the Has Done Event checking for my Goal event?

Only users who performed the events within the attribution window after interacting with the communication sent from Flow are counted for the converted trips. Therefore, the number of converted trips would be less than the number of users who performed the events.

The Has Done event or the other condition stages look for the criteria being fulfilled during the entire evaluation window rather than the engaged status. This difference in the evaluation criteria is the reason why the numbers may be different.

Why does my Segmentation and Funnels count differ from my Flow stats count?

Flows statistics display the metrics count at the unique trip level, while segmentation displays numbers at the unique user level. Therefore, if the same users enter a flow twice, the Flows Total Trips will show 2, while querying ""User Entered Flow in Segmentation for the same flow will show a value of 1. 

Also, comparisons between Funnels and Flows numbers, especially Conversions, are not recommended due to the different attribution logic in Flows. In Flows, the attribution window is extended with each Engagement shown by the user. While, in Funnels the attribution window entered is fixed and thus has a defined end time.

So, we would recommend to use Flow-related events in Funnels and Segmentation to make performance comparisons. The Flow-related events include:

User Entered Flow (use this instead of the Trigger event directly as step 1 in Funnels)
Flow Trip Conversion (use this as one of your steps instead of using the Conversion Event directly)
User Exited Flow
Why are total trips in my Event Triggered Flow less than expected?

Users will only enter Flows when they execute the trigger event, match the IF condition defined in the Flow, belong to the defined Target Audience Segment at the moment of execution of the trigger event, and meet other conditions such as entry limits (if defined in the Flow). Additionally, the users should not be part of active trips in the flow at the time of entry.

When the Target Audience is defined using Event-based/Custom Segment-based checks, the segment refreshes once every three hours. Therefore, users who join the audience in the future will only enter the flow if they match the trigger condition.

To avoid losing some users, consider defining the Target Audience without Event-based/Custom Segment-Based checks. Also, incorporate them within your Flows as the first step after the Entry stage.

User Entered Flow/User Exited Flow is being shown in the Trigger Condition dropdown but why is the campaign created on it not triggering?

We currently do not support these events in Trigger Condition (IF/AND for Smart Trigger campaigns or Entry for Flows).

Why are the stats shown in Canvas view and Detailed Stats view different when filtered for a specific date?

The Canvas view provides the stats for the users who entered during the filtered time period. While the Detailed stats view provides the stats for the users regardless of their entry.

So Canvas view numbers are to preferred when the goal is to understand the behaviour of users who entered during a specific time period. While the Detailed stats are to be used when the goal is to understand the overall flows performance or to understand the Channel Performance or specific Campaign performance."

FAQs
Event Triggered Flows
How do users enter Event Trigger Flows? 

MoEngage checks each time a user matches the IF condition stated in the Trigger condition to confirm whether they belong to the Target Audience. Users who are part of the Target Audience proceed to the next step of the evaluation process based on the other conditions outlined in the Flow only if they meet those conditions.

 

Thus, it is essential that a user falls under the Target Audience category during the time they meet the entry criteria. If not, they must satisfy the same conditions after becoming a part of the Target Audience to enter the flow.

 

Moreover, users can re-enter the flow only if they don't belong to the active trips for the same flow and meet all the conditions outlined in it. You can also set a limit on the number of entries to control the number of times users can enter the flow. Specify the desired limit in the second step of the Flow Creation process under the When users enter the flowsection.

When do we check if the user is part of the Target Audience in an Event Triggered Flow? 

MoEngage checks if the user is a part of the Target Audience when the trigger event is executed. Thus for a user to enter the flow, they should be part of the Target Audience before the trigger event is executed."

FAQs
User Merging and Flows
What is User Merge? How does it affect my Flows Metrics? 

The process of merging users comes into play when MoEngage can identify anonymous users upon signing up or logging in, usually associated with new users registering on your platform. In such scenarios, the past thirty minutes of activity for the guest profile or the last hundred events performed by the user (whichever is minimum) will get transferred to the registered profile. For more information, refer to User Merging.

 

To avoid any issues related to user merging, it is recommended to keep separate flows for sign-ups and welcome scenarios. Alternatively, you can configure an appropriate delay during the Entry Stage. When user profiles of users in your flows merge, the guest profile or anonymous profile for that user is subsequently dropped, and the registered profile continues from where the drop-off took place.

How to reduce user merge from happening while users are in flows? 

When anonymous users log in or sign up, MoEngage can sometimes identify them, which results in user merging. This typically occurs when new users sign up to your platform. To prevent user merging when users are in a flow, it is recommended to create separate flows for sign-ups and welcome scenarios or introduce a delay during the Entry Stage."
Transactional Alerts,https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/10672957787284-Overview-Inform,"User Guide 
Inform 
Overview
Overview - Inform

MoEngage Inform facilitates a unified messaging infrastructure across multiple channels using a single API to build and manage transactional alerts.

Transactional Alerts

Any time-sensitive transactional content that a brand sends to its customers is a Transactional Alert. The following are examples of transactional alerts:

Order/Booking/Purchase confirmations and pertinent updates
Shipping/Delivery confirmations and applicable updates
Security and account alerts for fraud prevention
Password resets 
OTP (one-time password)/ Verification Code
User invitations and shares
User inaction related to previous transactions
Legacy Transactional Messaging Structure

A notification is sent across multiple channels simultaneously, employing a multi-channel transactional messaging structure. To implement such a structure, you would need to:

Build APIs for multiple channels
Maintain these APIs across all channels and vendors
Maintain vendor contracts

Legacy Structure - Drawbacks

The current Transactional Messaging infrastructure has the following drawbacks:

Lack of requisite developer bandwidth - Heavy reliance on engineering bandwidth to make even the slightest changes
Lack of visibility on alert (message) performance - Absence of a centralized dashboard to manage alerts, content templates, and delivery partners
Lack of control over the content - Product, content, and marketing teams have limited control over the content and alert logic because of the wait for engineering bandwidth.
MoEngage Inform 

MoEngage Inform enables brands to build and manage transactional alerts across channels through One API. You can build, iterate quickly, and scale effortlessly.

 

Advantages

With MoEngage Inform, brands can utilize a single dashboard without the need to alter or deploy code. It helps to: 

send personalized Transactional Messages on multiple channels
add new channels
build and edit templates in minutes
switch seamlessly between messaging vendors
debug in real time easily with end-to-end logs
collaborate with the product, growth, and marketing teams to analyze and optimize alerts"

info	

Note

 

These channels need to be configured before Alert Creation. Refer to SMS Settings, Email Settings,  Push Settings and WhatsApp settings for configuring these channels.

Choose the channels on which the Alert has to be sent, and the content for the chosen channels can be defined in the next step (content creation) of Alert creation. It is mandatory to select at least one channel for Alert Creation. If more than one channel is selected, the content for both of them must be defined.

Set Channel Sending Order(Channel Fallback) 

If you choose more than one channel for Alert creation, you can configure if the Alerts should be sent parallelly or sequentially. When more than one channel is selected, the following channel-sending order options are available:

In parallel: You can send Alerts parallelly for only two channels.
In sequence (on Sender Failure): You can specify the Default, first, and second Fallback channels to be used when there is a failure to send using the Default channel. Channel fallbacks are employed in the case where:
there is an error in the request payload for the default or first fallback channel. For example, when the recipient details or personalization attributes are not present in the request payload for the channel
when the request returns a 4xx or 5xx error when submitted to the vendor for the particular channel. For example, invalid authorization details would result in a 401 error returned by the vendor, and this would be considered a failed-to-send error for the channel for which the delivery is being attempted.
vendor rejections for requests for channels would also lead to MoEngage using the fallback channel to send the Alert. For example, if your credit limit is exhausted for the vendor account, the vendor could reject the request to send the Alert. In such a case, MoEngage would use the fallback configured to send the Alert.

For example, if the default channel were Push, the first fallback WhatsApp and the second fallback SMS and an Alert would be sent to a customer. If there is a failure in sending the Push (say if the user does not have an active Push token), then the Alert will be attempted using the WhatsApp channel. If there is an issue in sending using the WhatsApp channel, the SMS channel will be tried next.


In sequence (on Delivery Failure): You can specify the Default channel and a Fallback channel to be used when the Default channel fails to deliver the alert. You can use the Delivery fallback configuration to set up the wait time window before switching the channel. In the Try successful delivery for _ before making a new attempt field, enter a value between 1 minute to 60 minutes. If the default channel fails to deliver the alert, the system makes a new attempt to deliver the alert using the Fallback channel after the wait time is over. 

For example, if the default channel is SMS and the fallback channel is Email and the wait time window is 5 minutes. If there is a failure in delivering the SMS, then the Alert will be attempted using the Email channel after 5 minutes.

Message 

This field will contain the message that would be sent to the user. You can personalize your message by clicking the Text personalization button to the right of the message editor. Refer to Personalize your Alert for details.

Shorten URL and Track URL 

This section displays URLs present in the message body. For selected URL(s), the URLs are shortened using the MoE domain(<to add MoE domain>) and sent to users.

info	

Note




Click tracking would only be enabled for URLs where Shorten & Track URL is enabled.


Create Content Using Custom Templates


You can choose one of the uploaded templates in this section to send Alerts using it. For more information, refer to SMS Custom Templates.


Add a Locale


To localize the Alert in various languages, click +Locale at the top right corner of the content creation step. You will have the option to add a new locale or add an existing locale to the campaign. You can copy the existing content from the default locale or create a new message altogether for the locale added. For more information, refer to Localize campaign message.


Preview your SMS


The preview of how your SMS Alert will look on the user’s device is shown on the right of the content creation section, as illustrated below.

 


Testing your SMS Content


The test Message section will help you test the message content by sending a test message. This will help you ensure the message is conveyed in the desired manner. This step is optional and lets you test the content of your Alert by sending it to a specified mobile number.



 

To Test the SMS Content, enter the mobile number in the format <country code><Mobile number>. For example, the recipient's mobile number should be similar to +14083636XX or 1408363XX
The test results are populated in the Test alert stats screen below.



 



info	

Note

 

If you have personalization attributes in your content, you can see how they are rendered by sending a test from the Test Request Details in Step 3 using an API. The test Message section will not render dynamic values for personalization attributes. For example, {{user}} would be sent as {{user}} for the test message, but in the Test and Live Alert, these will be replaced with the value for this attribute passed in the channel payload of the request.




In the case of failure, the Test alert stats screen contains the failure reason as shown below.

 



info	

Note

 

The Test Message option available here is different from the Test Request Details present in the Publish step of Alert creation. The Test Message section helps you test your content, while the Test Request Details will send a test request with the payload information to the API and show you the API response.

Publish
You can test your Alert before publishing to check if the integration with the API is working fine and to view the actual SMS and Email as they will be received by your users. For more information, refer to Test Your Alert.
To publish your Alert, click on Publish at the bottom right corner of the Publish page of Alert Creation. This will publish your Alert and generate an Alert ID that will be used to uniquely identify your Alert. You can also use the Reference ID that you entered to identify your alert.
You will now be taken to the Alert-Info page, where you can see the request details and message previews. You can also switch to the Analytics and Logs sections.

Test Alert

You can test your Alert before it is published in the third step of Alert creation. This option lets you test your alert on the chosen channels before publishing it, as shown below. 

info	

Note

This step is recommended (but optional) to ensure the API integration is set up correctly and the personalization is rendered properly.

How to test the Alert before publishing?

You need to pass a few values to the request copied from the Dashboard. They are the Authorization Header, MOE-APPKEY, request attributes, and personalization attributes (if any).

Build Authorization Header

MoEngage uses Basic Authentication. Use the Workspace ID and API Secret to generate HTTP Auth Header, as explained here.

Copy Request

You can also copy the sample request in any of the supported languages from the Test Request section in the dashboard and test it on an external console using the copy to clipboard icon.

Copy Workspace ID

The request header MOE-APPKEY should contain the Workspace ID value of your MoEngage Account. 

Test Alert ID

A Test Alert ID is provided on the Dashboard to send this Test Alert request to an external console. This value gets passed in the request automatically.

Note: This would differ from the Alert ID for the published Alert.

Test Alert Reference Name

Test Alert Reference Name is configured while adding the alert on the Dashboard to send this Test Alert request to an external console. This reference name can be used to test the alert.

info	

Information

This is different from the Reference ID for the published Alert.

Attributes

The following attributes need to be passed in the request:

Request Field	Mandatory	Description


MOE-APPKEY

	

Yes

	

This is the Workspace ID of your MoEngage Account. The Workspace ID uniquely identifies your MoEngage workspace. This value gets auto-populated in the test request (supported in multiple languages).


Authorization	Yes	This is the Base64 encoded authorization header (APPID:APISECRET) that needs to be passed for authentication.


alert_id

	

Yes

	

This is the Test Alert ID generated to test the request from an external console. This value is auto-populated in the request.




alert_reference_name

	

No

	

This is the reference ID that you can add while creating the alert.




user_id

	

No

	

This field is provided by your brand and should be pasted in the request being tested. This field is the Client ID and identifies the user to whom the Alert is being sent. This is essential for event mapping back to the user. 

If an Invalid User ID or non-existent User ID is shared and API request has valid recipient details, a new user profile would be created with valid recipient details.

If User ID is not present in the request, the request will still be processed, provided the recipient details are available. However, the events will not be logged to any user in MoEngage. For more information, refer to User identification for sending the Alert.




transaction_id

	

Yes

	

This field needs to be provided by the brand and pasted in the request being tested. This field identifies the transaction about which the Alert is being sent to the user.  Moengage will store the transaction ID against the uniquely generated request ID. Ensure that the transaction_id is unique for every request you send to the user. This is also used to support idempotency. 




payloads

	

Yes

	

This field contains the channel-level payload that, in turn, contains the user details and personalization attributes. The payload has the following structure:

""payloads"": {
    ""<Channel_Name>"": {
           ""recipient"": ""<pushtoken/mobile number with country  code/email id>"",

           ""locale"": ""<required locale version to be sent to the user>""
           ""personalized_attributes"": {
                  <list of the attributes to be personalized>
            }
    }
}

The recipient field in the payload identifies the user to whom the Alert has to be sent. For more information, refer to User identification for sending the Alert.

User identification for sending the Alert

The API processes the user identity information shared in the request and identifies the user to whom the communication needs to be sent, as shown below.

The channel level payload's recipient field is looked at first and based on the value provided for the recipient there; the Alert is sent to the mobile number/email ID or push token specified. In case the recipient details are not available, the user_id has to be passed in the request, failing which, the request will be dropped. If the user_id (the ID field in the User Profile)is available in the payload and the recipient details(mobile number/email ID/active push token) for the specified channel are available in the user profile, then the Alert is sent.

In case of recipient details are available and a new user_id is shared a new profile will be created with the recipient details.

info	

Note

Only the five most recently active device tokens available in the User Profile will be considered for sending the Alert for the Push channel.
The recipient details are fetched from the User Profile if user attributes are enabled. For more information, refer to Enabling User Attributes.

Once all the necessary information is added to the request, send the request from the external console.

Testing the request in Postman

To test in Postman, do the following:

Click on the copy & open Postman icon to copy the cURL and import it in Postman. 
Add the authentication details by using the authorization section. Add the Workspace ID as the username and the API Key as the password.
The imported cURL will contain the payload details. Add the Email ID, Phone Number, and other attributes (user_id, transaction_id, personalization, if any).
Click on Send in Postman. This will send the request to the Send Inform API.

For information about responses, error codes, and sample responses, refer to Inform API Response.

After you've tested the Alert, the Test Alert Logs get populated with details about the request's status. For more information, refer to Test Alert Logs."

Create
Test Alert Logs

Test logs are populated for every request triggered for this alert using the Test Request Details. This helps you debug request failures faster and identify bottlenecks in the process. Once you’ve tested the Alert, test logs get generated and can be viewed in the Test Request Logs section.

Request Details

Every row in the logs section contains information about the request received for the Test Alert. The following information is available for every request in the logs:

Request Received Time 

The timestamp that indicates when MoEngage received this request from you. This will show the exact time when the request was received, down to seconds.

Request ID 

The unique identifier that is assigned to every request. This value is generated and stored by MoEngage.

Channel 

This denotes the channel on which the request was sent. Requests may be sent on single or multiple channels.

Request Status 

This denotes the request status and represents different milestones where the request/message can fail. The possible statuses are:

Request Failed -When it is a duplicate request or an inactive alert (paused or dropped) was targeted
Request Processing - When MoEngage takes an unusually long to process the request and send it to the vendors.
Request Dropped - When the rate of requests is more than the rate limit set for alerts. MoEngage follows a rate-limiting of 10K requests per minute. Contact your account manager if you want to increase the API rate limit.
Delivery Pending - When MoEngage is still waiting for the delivery callback from the vendor of a particular channel. Some of the vendors take up to 15 mins to update whether a message was delivered.
Delivery Successful - When the vendor was able to deliver the message to the recipient. You can also check how quickly this message was delivered in the Time to Deliver column.
Delivery Failed - When the vendor was not able able to deliver the message. This could result due to various reasons like hard and soft bounces in email and errors like handset issues, incorrect mobile number, inbox full, and so on in SMS.
Delivery info NA - When MoEngage has not received any callbacks in the desired format from the vendors. This is applicable in the case of custom connectors and SMTP in SMS and Emails, respectively.
Recipient ID 

This denotes the recipient information to whom the message was targeted. This field contains the push token for push notifications, email address for the email channel, and the mobile number for SMS.

Transaction ID 

This is a unique identifier attached to every transaction for which the Alert is being sent. This value is used to support Idempotency in MoEngage. For more information, refer to idempotent requests.

Time to send 

This denotes the time taken by MoEngage to send the message to the vendor from the moment MoEngage received a request.

You can click on the row to get more information about the request. The following information is available for every request:

 
Delivery info - The Delivery Info section contains the details about when the request was received when the message was sent to the vendor for the specified channel, and the delivery time. In the case where the Alert is configured to be sent across multiple channels in a sequential manner, the following information is available:
Attempted via First Backup - <channelname>
Request received from Primary Channel - <channel name>
Attempted via Second Backup - <channelname>
 Request received from First Backup - <channel name>

For example, if the primary or default channel is Push, the first fallback is SMS, and the second fallback is Email, and the request fails for both Push and SMS and gets sent using the Email channel, the Delivery Info for these requests would appear as shown in the image below.

 

Request - The Request section contains the request payload for the specific channel for which the test log is being displayed.
Response - The Response section contains the response to the request generated by MoEngage.

Search Your Alert Logs

Alert Logs are a means to analyze the Alert performance based on request status, channel level filters, and unique identifiers such as the request ID, transaction ID, and recipient ID. You can search the logs using the following criteria:

Search by request ID or transaction ID

The request ID is a unique identifier given to a request received by MoEngage. The transaction ID is a unique identifier that identifies the transaction for which the Alert is being sent to the user. The transaction ID is generated and maintained by you and passed to MoEngage along with the request.
The search by request ID or transaction ID option helps you search the logs for a specific request or transaction in the Alert logs and see its status on the Dashboard.

Duplicate Requests

You can search for Duplicate requests by searching using the transaction ID. A request is considered a duplicate if it contains the same transaction ID as that of a previously successful or in-progress request within a 5-minute interval.
Note: The request ID and transaction ID need to be exact matches for a request to be called a duplicate; partial matches wouldn’t work.

Search by Channel

This option helps you filter the requests based on the selected channels (SMS and(or) email) and analyze the requests using the request or delivery status.

Search by Request Status

This option helps you filter the requests based on their status. The available filter options for status are:

Client-side personalization,https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/32987097465492-Client-side-versus-Server-side-personalization,"User Guide 
Personalize 
Overview
Client-side versus Server-side personalization
Client-side personalization
What is Client-side personalization

Client-Side personalization refers to the process of tailoring and modifying website content in real-time, based on the behavior, preferences, and past interactions of the website visitor. It's executed on the user's browser once the website page loads, using JavaScript SDKs. This JavaScript code primarily ensures the user identification, fetching of personalized experience created specifically for the user and rendering them on the website page.

How does Client-side personalization work?

Advantages of Client-side personalization
Visual Editors: Most client-side personalization tools come with WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors, which enable easy personalization of different elements within the webpage. In addition, there are out of the box widgets available that can be embedded within the webpages avoiding the need to write code.  
Ease of Implementation: It is generally easy to set up. You only need to incorporate a few lines of code on your website to ensure the SDK is integrated on all your webpages. 
Real-time Changes: It allows for real-time changes to be made on the webpage, as the tests are conducted after the webpage loads on the user's browser.

With client-side personalization, you can test hypotheses very quickly and then decide to deploy changes based on the experiment results.

Limitations of Client-side personalization
Works only on web browser: WYSIWYG visual editors work primarily with websites. Configuring similar experiences  on mobile apps and other digital platforms requires Server-side personalization capabilities. 
Feature management: Advanced experiments such as controlling the rollout of a new feature to your entire user base cannot be controlled using client-side personalization techniques. 
Impact on page load: Depending on the method of SDK Integration, a minor increase in page load time may be observed. 
When to use Client-side personalization
E-commerce: Retailers can use client-side personalization to display customized product recommendations based on the user's browsing history or search behavior.
Content Marketing: Publishers can personalize the content visible to each user based on their reading references or past engagement patterns.
A/B Testing: Marketers can use client-side personalization to conduct A/B tests to identify the best-performing version of a webpage, ad copy, or call to action.
Promotional Offers: Businesses can personalize promotional offers dynamically, driving conversions and enhancing customer engagement.
Server-side personalization
What is server-side personalization

In server-side, the personalization is done on the server side, meaning that the customized content is generated and delivered to the user's mobile app/browser directly from the server without the need for additional client-side processing. This allows for faster page load times and a seamless user experience.

How does server-side personalization work?

Advantages of server-side personalization
Consistency Across platforms: To ensure a seamless experience across App, website and other digital platforms & eliminate dependency on user's device or browser limitations, server-side testing is the best bet.
Speed & User Experience: If enhancing load times is a priority, server-side tests are most beneficial. They have quicker loading times than client-side experiments because they handle the variation before the page is sent from the server, eliminating any delay in page rendering that could occur with client-side testing. It avoids the flickering effect that sometimes happens in client-side testing when changes are made during or after the page load.
Complex Experiments: If you want to conduct a complex experiment that involves testing different algorithms, back-end processes, or core business logic, server-side testing would be the right choice. This could include testing a new recommendation algorithm for products or articles trying out new pricing logic or a new checkout flow.
SEO-Friendly: As the content is rendered at the server level and sent to the client’s browser, server-side testing is more SEO-friendly than client-side testing. The changes made through server-side testing will be properly indexed by search engines.
Security: Server-side testing is more secure as the logic resides on your server, not on the client's browser. It's ideal for testing sensitive areas, like payment processing or account login that require additional security measures.
Considerations for server-side personalization
Technical Expertise: Server-side personalization generally requires a higher level of technical knowledge than client-side testing, as modifications need to be made to the server-side code. Hence, you would need access to proficient developer resources and support.
Cost: Server-side personalization generally demands more development time and resources compared to client-side alternatives.
Speed of experimentation: If you need to conduct rapid iteration tests and observe quick results, client-side personalization could be more beneficial due to its higher implementation speed.

After filling in this information, click on Next. You will see a popup that opens.

URL(s) to Personalize

Specify the URL for personalization according to your need: 

Single Page

In this option, you can specify one URL to be personalized.

Multiple Pages

In this option, you can specify multiple URLs to be personalized. This is particularly useful when you wish to personalize a set of pages for a specific set of users. For example, let's consider the case where user lands on an e-commerce website after having clicked on an ad for jeans. Marketers may wish to customize the page that lists jeans and similar items such as shorts and trousers for such users. The multiple-page personalization option is useful in such cases.

To add multiple pages, click on the + symbol and add the URLs for the pages to be personalized. You can specify the exact URLs to be included or excluded using the filter conditions - is and is not. You can also specify URLs that begin with, end with, and contain certain phrases to be included or excluded. For example, to include any URL that contains jeans, specify the filter condition as follows:

Custom Attributes

In this option, you can personalize multiple webpages based on the type of the webpage(s) and/or the information on the webpage(s). This is particularly useful when you wish to personalize a set of pages for a specific set of users. For example, determine that the webpage is the site homepage or a category page (say, furniture or electronics) without relying on the URL structure of the webpage. 

To add multiple attributes, click on the + symbol and select the attributes from the dropdown. You can specify the exact attributes to be included or excluded using the filter conditions - is and is not. You can also specify attributes that begin with, end with, and contain certain phrases to be included or excluded. For example, personalize all webpages where the attribute pageType is product.

You can choose from a list of pre-defined attribute types or define a custom attribute of your own following the steps here.

After specifying the URL(s) for personalization, click Validate. This will:

Check if the Web SDK is integrated.
Check if an experience has already been configured for the URL specified for personalization. A message is shown in the UI if an experience has already been added to the URL 

You can personalize the URL by clicking Personalize URL at the bottom right corner of the popup.

Step 2: Content

In this step, you personalize the webpage using MoEngage's WYSIWYG editor. Refer here for a deep-dive on the editor capabilities. 

Additionally, you can perform A/B testing using one of the below methods:

Click Next after personalizing the URLs for all the variations and audience segments to move to define the delivery schedule and delivery controls for the experience.

Step 3: Schedule and goals

In this step, set the scheduling criteria for your experience. You can set the start and end dates and times for your experience. 

Conversion Goals

You can add conversion goals to track your business metrics for your experience. You can track up to 5 conversion goals. You can choose any app event as a conversion goal activity and can set more than one conversion goal. The first goal will be treated as a primary goal.

With multiple conversion goals, you can track more than one business metric or visualize a funnel for your user actions. For example, if you want to check the following, you can do so with multiple conversion goals.

How many users have viewed the product page?
How many of them added that product to the cart?
How many of them made a successful order?

Tracking Revenue Performance

With MoEngage, you can very easily track revenue for your campaigns. The Revenue and ROI of the campaigns are available to you. For example, you can answer the question of how much revenue my product made after sending a communication. 

While setting the conversion goal, you can choose the goal for which you want to track the Revenue by enabling the 'Revenue Performance' toggle. In the example below, to track revenue for orderSuccessfulevents, the 'Revenue performance' toggle needs to be enabled.

Revenue Tracking is optional and non-mandatory. You can disable the Revenue performance toggle to disable it. After choosing the goal, you can choose the numeric attribute that captures the order's total monetary value. In the example below, cartValue contains the total order value. You can also choose the currency in which your monetary value is being reported.

Set Attribution window

We also allow you to set an attribution window, i.e., duration, calculated from the time the user received the campaign, for which you want to attribute the conversion goals to a specific campaign. As a default, it is set for 36 hours. Say, for the example above, we set it to 5 hours. 

 

Delivery Controls

This option lets you assign priorities to your experience. You can assign the following Experience priorities: Low, Medium, High, and Critical. If a URL has more than one experience created, the experience with the higher priority is shown to the user.

Click Publish at the bottom right corner of the screen to publish the experience."

Analytics

The analytics section contains information about the performance stats and revenue metrics.

Global Analytics Filters

These filters are applied to all the sections in the Analytics tab.

Date range - Select the date range for which you want to view the performance stats.
Attribution type - Select the attribution type (Click through, In-session, and View through) from the dropdown to view the analytics information for the specified attribution type. The default attribution type is the View through attribution. For more information, see Conversion and Attribution.
Select audience - Select the audience for whom you want to view the performance stats. The default audience is All Audiences.
Attribution Types

With conversion tracking, marketers can see which experiences have led to achieving business goals set as custom conversions. There are three attribution types:

View through attribution - The view through attribution is an Impression-based tracking and is displayed by default when experience analytics is loaded. View-through attribution is the total number of conversion goals executed by users who were delivered a personalized web experience within the configured attribution window from the time of viewing the experience. This appears as a default filter in your Experience Performance. For example, If the user was delivered a web experience for a URL at 7 AM and the Attribution window for the experience was 12 hours, the user conversion events till 7 PM will be attributed to this experience using View-Through Attribution.
Click-through attribution -Click-through attribution is the number of conversion goals executed by users who clicked the CTA configured in the visual editor within the configured attribution window from the time of click. For example, If the user is delivered a web experience at 7 AM and clicks on the CTA at 8 AM, and your Attribution window is 12 hours, the user conversion events till 8 pm are attributed to this experience in Click-Through Attribution.
In-session attribution - The in-session attribution is based on In-session tracking. The in-session attribution is the number of conversion goals executed by users within 30 minutes after clicking the CTA configured in the visual editor. For example, If the user is delivered a web experience at 7 AM and clicks on the CTA at 8 AM, and your Attribution window is 12 hours, the user conversion events till 8:30 am (within 30 minutes of starting the session) will be attributed to this experience in In-Session Attribution.

Attribution Window - Attribution Window is the duration calculated from the time a user receives or clicks the experience having specific conversion goals. For example, two experiences with a conversion goal as a purchase are created. Experience E1 at time H hours and experience E2 at H+12 hours. The customer achieves the conversion goal for purchase with the experiences C1 and C2 at time H+15 hours. The conversion of customers is attributed both to E1 and E2.

All the metrics are calculated and displayed in the App's Timezone.

 
Experience Performance Stats

Experience performance provides the impact of your experiences.

Actions that can be performed in the stats section

Choose the number view (#) or the percentage view (%) to see the stats as numbers or percentage values.


View the unique or total occurrences of stats by selecting Unique or Total in the dropdown at the top of the section.



The following stats are available:

Metric	Description
Impressions	This metric represents the number of times users in the target audience have received the personalized variations configured by the marketer. Higher impressions represent a higher reach of your experiences.
Clicked	This metric represents the total number of clicks on the target element by the users after receiving the personalized variation.
Conversions	

This metric displays the number of times users converted from each personalized variation. For active experiences, conversions represent the number of unique users converted per instance of an active experience. For example:

If a user receives one personalized variation on Day X and another on Day Y and converts once on both days, the conversions are counted as two (instead of being counted as one in the previous version.)
If a user receives one personalized variation on Day X and converts twice from the same variation, conversions will be counted as 1.
If a user receives two personalized variations of the same experience on Day X and converts for both, conversions will be counted as 2.

Click Through Rate (CTR)	

The percentage ratio of total clicks to the total number of impressions delivered. Click through rate = ((Total clicks) / (Total Impressions)) * 100


Conversion Rate (CVR)	

The percentage ratio of total conversions for the primary goal to the total number of impressions delivered.

Primary Goal Conversions are the total number of primary conversion goal events within the attribution window (configurable) from the time user received the notification.

Conversion Rate - The percentage ratio of users who have performed the conversion event. The conversion count is tracked as Unique. The conversion rate for the various attribution types are listed below:

View through attribution CVR = ((Unique conversions) / (Total impressions)) * 100
Click through attribution CVR - ((Unique conversions) / (Total clicks)) * 100
In-session attribution - ((Unique conversions) / (Total clicks)) * 100
 
Audience/Variation Performance
You can see the breakdown of performance metrics (Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, Conversion goals) across each audience and variation, allowing you to assess and compare the effectiveness of the various audience and variation combinations. You can choose the metrics for which you wish to see the comparison in the metrics dropdown and filter using the following mechanisms:
Group by audience - Lists performance of the metrics selected for each variation grouped by the audience. Hover over the bar graph to understand how each variation has performed for the specified metric in an audience.
Group by variation - Lists performance of each metric in all audiences grouped by the variation. Hover over the bar chart to understand how each audience has performed for the specific metric in a variation.
Conversion Goals Performance

You will be able to see this section when you have set more than one conversion goal for your experience. The section compares the performance of goals set by the marketer for the experience.

Total Conversions: Will show all goal events for the respective goals i.e. if a user made a purchase twice, it will be shown twice. It is the equivalent of conversion events covered in the sections above.

Unique Conversions: Goals are unique across the users converted per experience instance. It is the equivalent of the Conversions metric covered in the sections above.

Revenue Metrics

You will see three revenue metrics for your experience if they are enabled for the primary goal.

Total Revenue is the sum of the total order value across conversion events attributed to the experience.
Average Order value = (Total Revenue)/(Number of Conversion Events)
Average revenue per user = (Total Revenue)/(Number of Unique Conversions)

These revenue metrics are tracked for all attribution types- View through, Click Through, and In-session attribution.

Responsive design:

The option allows you to select whether you want to keep the changes or the personalized experience for the current variation across all devices or just the current device.


Element selector:

This option allows you to identify elements on the webpage using HTML ID and CSS selector.

 

Use element's HTML ID

An HTML element ID is a unique identifier used in website code to label a specific section or element on a web page. It helps to pinpoint and work with particular parts of a web page.

Using the element's HTML ID will show the HTML ID for the elements you select, as shown below.

 




Use element's CSS sector 
Using a CSS selector is a way to identify and select specific elements within an HTML document and apply styles to them. This path can include elements, IDs, classes, and other attributes to pinpoint the exact element or group of elements you want to style. It defines a chain of elements to follow in the HTML document structure to reach the targeted element.

Using the element's CSS will show the CSS for the elements you select, as shown below.



By default, the MoEngage Personalize editor Is configured to identify elements using IDs. If IDs are not present or specified, MoEngage uses the HTML selector path for the element.

Webpages with elements having dynamic IDs

A webpage can have elements with dynamic IDs. Dynamic IDs are IDs that change every time the page loads or as a result of user interaction or a script running on the page.
For CSS styling and JavaScript manipulation, dynamic IDs can be challenging to work with because the identifiers are not consistent.

In such cases, it is advised to disable the Element ID selector on the MoEngage editor and work with the HTML selector path of the element.

Reset

The Reset  option enables you to delete all the changes were made to the current variation across all devices or a specific device.


While Reset enables you to delete all the changes done to the variation at once, Changes allows you to delete or edit the individual modifications done to each element in that variation.
All the changes made to each element in the selected variation will be logged in the Changes dropdown. You can click the Changes dropdown and select Delete icon to undo the modifications associated with that element. The GIF below shows an example of resetting the previously deleted Shop now button. As soon as you reset the change, the button reappears in its original position."

Create Server-side Personalization Experience
Overview

MoEngage Personalize helps you to create real-time connected experiences that accelerate conversions. In turn, this aids in connecting your customer needs and your brand experience.

To create a Server-side Personalization experience, navigate to:

Personalize > All Experiences, Click +Experience > Web & App (API).

Step to Create a Server-side Experience

There are three steps to create a new server-side experience

Target Users: Specify the audience for your web experience.

Content: Specify the variation and personalized content for the selected users.

Schedule and goals: Specify a delivery schedule and conversion goals for the experience.

Step 1: Target Users

This section contains the following: 

Experience Details
Experience name - Type the name of the experience to manage and identify it. The experience name must have at least five characters and at most 256.
Experience tags - Select the experience tags from the drop-down list. Tags help you add context to your experience. For example, you can add 'onboarding' as a tag for an experience created for onboarding users to your platform or app. For more information, refer to Tags.
Experience key - Specify an experience key that will help you uniquely identify the experience. The experience key will be used as part of the API request to fetch server-side experiences. Experience key must have atleast five characters and at most 50. Experience key cannot be updated once the server-side experience is published.
Target Audience

Select +Add Audience to define the target user segment for the Experience. 


arrow_drop_down
Defining your Target Audience
Step 2: Content

In this step, you can add A/B testing and define the content for each variation that will be returned in response to the API request.

As part of content definition, you can create multiple variations for each audience and control visitor traffic distribution across the variations. For each audience targeted in the experience, you can create upto 5 variations.

Field

	

Description




Variation

	

There are two options present by default:

Default Variation

Variation 1

You can add another variation by clicking the + Variation at the lower left corner of the screen.

Note: You can add up to 5 variations for each target audience.




Users (%total)

	

You can control visitor traffic distribution for each variation in this field.

For each variation, you can define a set of variables and their values that will be returned in the response to the API request. Variables will allow you to modify aspects of the webpage without modifying & deploying the code repeatedly. For example, if you want to update an image URL and the webpage the user gets redirected to, you can turn the image URL and the corresponding webpage address into a variable to allow users to easily make the changes.

Variable types

Each variable must have one of the following data types

Number

String

Boolean

Float

JSON

info	

Information

It is recommended to retain the same list of variables for all variations (incl. Default) for an audience.

Personalization of Content

You can personalize the content using User Attributes, User Events, Product Sets, Content APIs and Content Blocks.

Click Done.

info	

Note

Ensure that custom attributes do not have the same names as MoEngage's standard attributes. If a custom attribute and a standard attribute having the same name are used for personalization, it could result in incorrect personalization.

 

Step 3: Schedule and goals

In this step, set the scheduling criteria for your experience. You can set the start and end dates and times for your experience. 

Conversion Goals

You can add conversion goals to track your business metrics for your experience. You can track up to 5 conversion goals. You can choose any app event as a conversion goal activity and can set more than one conversion goal. The first goal will be treated as a primary goal.

With multiple conversion goals, you can track more than one business metric or visualize a funnel for your user actions. For example, if you want to check the following, you can do so with multiple conversion goals.

How many users have viewed the product page?
How many of them added that product to the cart?
How many of them made a successful order?

Tracking Revenue Performance

With MoEngage, you can very easily track revenue for your campaigns. The Revenue and ROI of the campaigns are available to you. For example, you can answer the question of how much revenue my product made after sending a communication. 

While setting the conversion goal, you can choose the goal for which you want to track the Revenue by enabling the 'Revenue Performance' toggle. In the example below, to track revenue for orderSuccessfulevents, the 'Revenue performance' toggle needs to be enabled.

Revenue Tracking is optional and non-mandatory. You can disable the Revenue performance toggle to disable it. After choosing the goal, you can choose the numeric attribute that captures the order's total monetary value. In the example below, cartValue contains the total order value. You can also choose the currency in which your monetary value is being reported.

Set Attribution window

We also allow you to set an attribution window, i.e., duration, calculated from the time the user received the campaign, for which you want to attribute the conversion goals to a specific campaign. As a default, it is set for 36 hours. Say, for the example above, we set it to 5 hours. 

 

Delivery Controls

Things to Know
How to manage flicker on websites
What is flicker?

A webpage may Flicker when the browser takes too long to load and process changes. In such cases, the browser displays the webpage in its original or control state for a few seconds before meeting the test requirements to apply the changes. This causes the webpage to flicker noticeably while the changes take effect.

For instance, before viewing any new MoEngage content on your application, you may have sometimes observed a brief disruption in the user interface elements caused by a Flicker.

Impact of flicker

Flickers can negatively impact user trust in the following ways:

Negative impression: A webpage that flickers or flashes during content loading may appear unstable or poorly designed. Users may begin to doubt the site's reliability and professionalism.
Slow performance perception: Flickering may give the impression that a website is sluggish or the content is loading slowly. Users may believe there are problems with the website's content and overall performance. Users may lose trust due to the website's slow behavior and become reluctant to interact with it further.
Unfinished or unreliable information: When people attempt to read or interact with the content on your application, flickering can convey an impression that the information or functionality is untrustworthy or incomplete. Users may lose faith in the accuracy and validity of the content.
User experience disruption: Flickering can be annoying and distracting, causing anger and frustration. If users perceive frequent flickering in their browsing experience, they may lose trust in the website's capacity to provide a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

In general, flickering can undermine trust by damaging the perception of professionalism, site reliability, loading speed, and content accuracy. Providing a seamless and flicker-free experience is essential for building trust and ensuring users feel confident in the website and its offerings.

Factors Leading to flicker

Flicker can be caused by factors such as the installation method of scripts and tag management on the website, the loading method of the A/B testing tool (synchronous VS asynchronous), the size of the SDK, and the number of experiments being implemented.

Direct Installation vs. Tag Managers

Although Tag managers simplify implementing and deploying JavaScript code, they usually add a layer of JavaScript execution to your website, which may cause some performance overhead. This can impact the page load time and user experience, especially if multiple tags and scripts are involved. To overcome this limitation, you can do the following:

Prioritize Execution

Placing third-party code at the top of the <head> allows it to be loaded and executed before other scripts and content on the page. This ensures the code to run as early as possible, reducing potential initialization delays.

warning	

Warning

MoEngage recommends installing the Web Personalization SDK at the start of the <head> element.
If the code is added at the end of the webpage in the tag, the browser executes the code only at the end after the webpage content has loaded, leading to flickering.
Accelerate Execution and Boost Visibility

Loading the Personalization SDK early in the page-load process can immediately start tracking all associated functionality. 

Loading the A/B Testing Tool

A/B testing compares two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine and display the one that performs better. For variations to be applied to your application, the A/B testing script must be loaded and executed in one of the following ways:

Synchronous Loading

In synchronous JavaScript loading, scripts are loaded and executed one line at a time. To move on to the next script or to render the page further, the browser pauses rendering and waits for each script to load and run.

Asynchronous Loading

In asynchronous JavaScript loading, scripts are loaded and executed in parallel while the page is still being loaded. The browser does not depend on the timing of when the module should be loaded and continues rendering and loading other resources while the older scripts are being loaded in the background.

Although asynchronous script loading might speed up the overall page loading, it can also result in flickering when the A/B testing script is loaded later. The flickering occurs because the original page is rendered first, and then the variation is applied once the A/B testing script is loaded and executed. This can create a noticeable visual change for the user, which is typically not desired in A/B testing scenarios.

warning	

Warning

MoEngage recommends synchronous loading of the Web Personalization script to prevent flickering.

SDK Specifications
SDK Size

Another factor that significantly impacts page load time is the size of the SDK, which determines how long it will take for the browser to download it. A larger SDK size can increase the time it takes to download and execute the code, which in turn increases the time for the webpage to load the content. 

info	

Information

MoEngage Web personalization SDK is just a few kBs which significantly reduces the time to download and execute it.

Number of Experiments

The time taken to render personalized content for a visitor also depends on the number of experiences that are fetched by the SDK.

 

MoEngage delivers only active and relevant visitor experiences based on your chosen target criteria. Additionally, MoEngage prioritizes experiences specific to the webpage on which the visitor has landed while fetching the remaining experiences set up on the rest of the website in parallel which considerably speeds up the webpage personalization process.


Apart from this, the experiences delivered to the visitor contain only the changes that are to be updated or added to a specific webpage element compared to the original content. This helps in reducing the payload size thereby reducing the delivery time and faster rendering of the changes.



Minimize Flicker
Anti-Flicker Snippet
How does it Work?

The content on a webpage can be hidden using certain settings in the code. This is done to quickly hide and then show the content after making changes.

Points to Remember:

If there are any problems with loading or implementing the code, users may see a blank page or screen for a few seconds or even longer. It's important to ensure that the content appears within a few milliseconds, allowing enough time for the changes to happen.
If the changes are not visible within a certain timeframe, usually a few seconds, it's important to display the hidden content and apply the changes later. This prevents users from thinking that the website is slow or not working properly.

MoEngage Anti-flicker snippet hides the page content for a default duration of 1.5s until the personalized changes are shown to the visitor. In almost all cases, the changes are applied and the page content is made visible to the user within 0.5s. The default duration of 1.5s can also be modified by updating the value of the MAX_RENDER_TIME variable.

Switch to Server-Side personalization

Switching to server-side personalizaton can be a viable approach to minimize flickering in A/B testing scenarios. Server-side personalization involves rendering different variations of a webpage on the server before delivering it to the user. This way, the user sees the desired variation from the beginning, eliminating any flicker caused by client-side changes.

Here are some advantages of server-sider personalization for minimizing flicker:

Immediate display of variation: With server-side personalization, the server delivers the fully modified page to the user, ensuring that the desired variation is displayed from the initial load. This eliminates any flicker caused by client-side changes that may occur with other approaches.
No dependency on client-side resources: In server-side personalization, the variations are generated on the server without requiring additional client-side resources to load or execute JavaScript. This reduces the risk of delays caused by slow-loading scripts or dependencies, further minimizing the potential for flickering.
Improved user experience: By avoiding flickering, server-side personalization provides a more consistent and seamless user experience. Users see the desired variation right from the start, resulting in improved engagement and satisfaction."

Personalize 
Things to Know
Content Security Policy and impact on Personalization
What is Content Security Policy

Content Security Policy (CSP) for websites is a security mechanism that allows web administrators to define and enforce rules for how resources (such as scripts, stylesheets, images, and fonts) are loaded and executed on their websites. It helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other types of code injection vulnerabilities.

CSP works by specifying an HTTP header or a meta tag in the website's HTML code, which contains a policy directive defining the allowed sources for various types of content. These sources can include hostnames, paths, or specific types of content (e.g., 'self' for the same origin, 'none' for disallowed, 'unsafe-inline' for inline scripts/styles, and 'unsafe-eval' for evaluating code dynamically).

HTML
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	<!DOCTYPE html>

	<meta http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" content=""default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' www.example.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com;"">

	</head>

In this example:

default-src 'self'; sets the default policy for all resource types to only allow resources from the same origin ('self').
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' www.example.com; allows scripts to be loaded from the same origin ('self'), allows inline scripts ('unsafe-inline'), and allows scripts from www.example.com.
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' fonts.googleapis.com; allows stylesheets to be loaded from the same origin ('self'), allows inline styles ('unsafe-inline'), and allows stylesheets from fonts.googleapis.com.
img-src 'self' data; allows images to be loaded from the same origin ('self') and allows data URLs.
font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com; allows fonts to be loaded from the same origin ('self') and allows fonts from fonts.gstatic.com.
Why is CSP important

When a user visits a website with CSP enabled, their browser will check if the requested resources comply with the defined policy. If any resources do not meet the policy's rules, the browser may block or modify their behavior, depending on the configuration.

CSP provides several benefits, including:

Mitigation of XSS attacks: By restricting the sources of executable code, CSP reduces the risk of malicious code injection by only allowing trusted sources.
Protection against data exfiltration: CSP can prevent unauthorized data transmissions by limiting the origins to which data can be sent.
Protection against clickjacking: CSP can prevent clickjacking attacks by restricting the frame or iframe sources.
Enhanced security posture: CSP helps in fortifying the overall security of web applications and websites by providing an additional layer of protection against various types of attacks.
How does it impact Personalize

If you have implemented a Content Security Policy (CSP) for your website, which specifies the allowed sources for loading your website's content, browsers will reject content from sources that are not whitelisted. In this scenario, browsers will not permit MoEngage to load content on your website. As a result, the loading of variations that you have created in MoEngage may be affected.

How to navigate CSP

To enable MoEngage to load variations on your website and generate previews for your variations, you need to whitelist MoEngage by updating the corresponding rules in your existing Content Security Policy (CSP).

MoEngage Recommendations

All recommendations are not the same in nature, and businesses need to understand the different types of recommendations to provide the best possible experience. By understanding the context and strengths of each recommendation type, businesses can deliver the right personalization experience that best suits their needs.

Types of Recommendations

MoEngage has two categories of recommendations.

Basic Recommendations

These recommendations are based on rules and offer the following models for setting up recommendations. You can learn more about the basic recommendations in this article.

Item Attributes
User actions
Advanced Recommendations

These recommendations utilize sophisticated machine learning and deep learning algorithms, incorporating the following distinct models. You can learn more about the advanced recommendations in this article.

Frequently bought together items
Getting Started

Delivering item recommendation experience to consumers is a set of processes, which can be classified into the following categories.

The setup consists of the following steps:

Recommendation settings: These configurations enable the recommendations to comprehend your data points, user behavior, and generate personalized results based on the specific requirements of your use case.

Product catalogs: A catalog contains a list of all business offerings and respective information. Campaigns are personalized with item attributes of recommended items from the catalog. 
Map the User actions: The actions performed by users on the app or website need to be mapped to standard MoEngage events for MoEngage to understand the items interacted while performing those custom actions. For example, when a user adds an item to the shopping cart, MoEngage needs to know which event contains this information to track that event and store the item attributes associated with the event.
Create Recommendation: The recommendations are defined by the user to select items from a product catalog based on a user action or catalog attribute. After you create the recommendations, you can use them in different types of campaigns.
Campaign personalization: Regardless of the type of recommendation, the process of personalizing it in the campaign content remains the same. You can personalize content with one or more recommendations in the same campaign under content steps. You can also create additional content rules with flexible Jinja programs.

Pre-requisites
Overview

Before using recommendations, you must fulfill specific requirements, which involve providing contextual information about users and items. This information enables the recommendation models to interpret and learn user behavior and generate relevant results with the item attributes for personalization.

Item Catalog

An item catalog is a comprehensive list of all your business offerings. Each item in the catalog must have relevant details associated with it.

Marketers can connect the product catalog to MoEngage and use the product information in their campaigns. Ensure that your item catalog is up-to-date and represents your business offerings accurately. This enables the recommendation system to provide personalized suggestions based on the items in the catalog.

User Actions events

User action events are mandatory for personalized recommendations. Categorizing user-item interactions into standard events helps MoEngage interpret user behavior accurately.

For instance, when a user adds an item to the shopping cart, MoEngage needs to identify the event and store the associated unique item ID.

Fulfilling these prerequisites empowers you to leverage recommendations for personalized content and improved user engagement"

An item catalog is a prerequisite for creating and using recommendations. It is a comprehensive list of all your business offerings with their relevant details, such as products, services, flights, articles properties, restaurants, dishes, and social media feeds.

Catalog

The Catalog feature allows you to create and manage item catalogs. You can connect your item catalog to MoEngage and utilize the item information in your campaigns.

Create Catalog

To create an item catalog, follow these steps:

Go to Content > Catalogs from the left navigation. The Catalogs page is displayed.
Click Create Catalog.
In the Enter catalog name field, enter a name for the catalog.
Click Create.

As you land to the newly created catalog, you'll notice the option to 'add feed' to populate your catalog. These feeds serve as data sources, providing a list of items and assisting in keeping them updated.

Feeds

Feeds act as the data source for item information in the catalog. Feeds allow you to upload, update, or sync item information. They contain a set of items fetched or uploaded from a source.

info	

Note

Whether you have a single feed for all items or multiple feeds for different purposes, MoEngage offers the flexibility to fulfill your specific requirements.
Types of Feeds

Feeds provide detailed attributes of the items, such as ID, title, link, and image link. The following are the feed options:

Manual Upload: The manual upload option in the Catalog feature allows marketers to upload a CSV file containing item listings. This method is suitable for situations where marketers want to perform a one-time upload of their item information.
URL Upload: Marketers can establish a connection with their external catalog and sync it with MoEngage by defining the catalog source URL. This enables timely synchronization and updates of relevant item attribute information. With options such as daily, weekly, or hourly intervals, marketers can ensure their item information remains up-to-date in MoEngage, making it ideal for almost real-time or frequent updates to the item catalog.

info	Note
If you do not want to make your catalog feed URL public, you can import it via SFTP-based ingestion. Below are the following MoEngage IPs:
DCO1: 52.1.205.204
DC02: 18.195.110.23, 3.77.101.97
DC03: 3.6.251.95
DC04: 18.217.73.1
Adding Feeds to Catalogs

To add feeds to catalogs, follow these steps:

Go to Content > Catalogs from the left navigation. The Catalogs page is displayed.
Click the Add feed button for the desired catalog.
Choose one of the following feed upload options:
Manual upload: To manually upload a CSV file, select the Manual upload option. Select the CSV file containing your item listings.


URL upload: To sync your catalog file, define the file source URL of your catalog. MoEngage supports CSV, TSV, and XML files with any HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and SFTP connection URL. You can choose from daily, weekly, or hourly sync options to keep your item information up-to-date in MoEngage.
info	

Note

MoEngage expects the following mandatory attributes with every feed:

id
title
link
image_link

Click this sample CSV file for a catalog that supports feeds:


Feed Upload States

After you add a feed to a catalog, the feed upload action can have the following states:

Success: The Feed is uploaded successfully and is available for use in the Catalog.
Pending: The Feed is currently being processed.
Processed with Error: There are some errors with some of the items in the uploaded feed. The feed is uploaded partially.
Error: There was an error during the feed upload, and the feed is not uploaded.
warning	

Warning

Here are the most common reasons for errors or failures that you may want to prevent.

Once the feed has successfully updated, a summary catalog report will be visible at the top of the catalog page. This report includes:

Total items:This displays the current total count of items present in the catalog.

Total items: The count of data source(s) feeds configured to populate and update the catalog.
Last updated on: This information tells you when the catalog was last updated. In cases with multiple feeds, this will reflect the most recent feed update time.
Last updated status: This indicates the status of the most recent catalog update. If multiple feeds are in operation, it features the status of the most recent feed processed.
Next update on: This indicates when the catalog is scheduled to be updated next. In a situation where multiple feeds are configured for a catalog, the last and next update to catalog can happen from two different feeds.
Items

After successfully uploading the feed(s) to the catalog, navigate to the Items tab to view a comprehensive list of items. The Items tab allows you to view item details for 200 sample items. If you're looking for a particular item from the entire list of items in your catalog, use the search option in the Items tab.

Search Items

The Items tab has a search functionality to assist you in finding a particular item quickly.  Follow these steps to effectively search for items in your catalog:

Locate the search bar under the Item tab.
Enter the search term associated with the unique ID, title, or description of item you are trying to locate in the search field.
Press enter on your keyboard.

The search will immediately filter the list to display only the items that correspond to your search criteria. The search function includes a comprehensive examination of unique item IDs, titles, and descriptions in search results.

After finding the desired item, you can view more details by clicking the item in the list.

Catalog Update Alerts

The alert management system meticulously tracks catalog updates, instantly updating marketers about the status of updates. It issues notifications for completed updates and provides insightful error messages for any failures. These error messages are critical in maintaining data quality and facilitating issue resolution. The catalog update alerts can be triggered for feed processing success or failure:

Whenever a feed file is successfully processed, the system sends an email indicating the completion of the process. Importantly, it includes detailed statistics about the processed items, such as the count of newly added, updated, or deleted items. Additionally, in instances where some items could not be processed, the system generates a report with the unprocessed items count and its primary reasons.
In case of any failure in processing, the alert management system provides error messages. These messages are important because they explain what went wrong during the file processing, thereby providing insight to help rectify the issue.

You can subscribe for the catalog update alerts from the Manage Alerts option in the catalog page.

Manage Alerts
Go to Content > Catalogs from the left navigation. 
Click the specific catalog you wish to configure update alerts for.
In the catalog page, click Manage alerts at the top section. The Catalog update alerts pop-up window is displayed.
In the Email address field, set up the desired email addresses to subscribe for the update alerts. Please ensure to press Enter after adding each email address. You can configure a maximum of 50 email addresses.


Under Notify on, mark the checkboxes corresponding to the desired alerts type based on the preference.
Click Save to save the subscription preferences.

Any feed processing undertaken after the 'Save' action will automatically trigger the stipulated email alerts to the subscribed email addresses.

info	

Note

When you create a new catalog, your email address will be automatically subscribed for catalog update alerts. To modify these subscription preferences, visit the 'Manage alerts' section at the top section of the catalog page.

Overview

The Map User Action feature allows you to categorize user-item interaction events into standard user events, enabling personalized recommendations based on user engagement. The Map User Action feature acts as a bridge between user engagement events and the attributes of the corresponding items from the catalog.

These settings are accessible by the users with the following access role: Admin/Manager.

User Activity Events

Tracking user events that include the item ID attribute is crucial for behavior-based recommendations. To ensure accurate interpretation of user behavior and personalized recommendations, MoEngage requires mapping app-specific event names to its standard events.

This mapping process enables the use of advanced algorithms and models with standardized event data, resulting in accurate and unique recommendations that align with user preferences and behaviors.

Mapping User Action Events

To map user events to MoEngage standard events, follow these steps:

Go to Content > Recommendations from the left navigation. The Recommendations page is displayed.
Click Map user actions.
Click the event drop-down list under a User Action bucket and choose the relevant action from the drop-down menu.
Choose the right event, respective unique item ID attribute that represents the inteaction with the specific item. You can also map the price and quantity attributes carrying the related information of the item at the time of interaction. For example:
Choose an event ""Add to Cart"".
Select the event attribute ""Product ID"".
Select the event attribute ""Price"" of item interaction.
Select the event attribute ""Quantity"" of item interaction.
MoEngage Recommendations Start listening to this user event-attributes combination for all such events performed after mapping time. You can check the event mapping time by expanding a bucket.

Note: Item Mapping time is not available for the events mapped before February '24

Overall, mapping user action settings is crucial for personalized recommendations because it enables the recommendation system to understand user behavior and establish item-user connections."

Overview - Basic Recommendations
Basic Recommendations

Basic recommendations are a set of straightforward custom rules which act as filters. In addition, you can sort these items by numeric catalog attributes. Basic recommendations consist of the following models.

1. Item attributes

This model applies manual merchandising rules using the catalog attribute filters and sorting by some numerical catalog attribute e.g. price. These recommendations are used when you want to promote certain types of products. Additionally, these recommendations can be customized to align with the user's profile.

Example use-cases
Reveal the 'New arrivals' section
Inspire with your branded collection
Celebrate with our festive picks
Recommend ideal jobs matched to your users' skill set
Locate local restaurants near your customers.
2. User actions

This models aid in recollecting items that users have recently engaged with. In the retail sector, when a user creates a wishlist or adds an item to their cart, it indicates their strong intention to purchase. Likewise, in classified industries, viewing an item can be seen as a strong indicator of interest. By customizing campaigns that focus on recalling these interactions, they can serve as a decisive factor.

Example use-cases
Recover lost sales with cart abandonment reminders
Boost engagement with personalized campaigns from users' wish lists
Re-engage users with recently viewed items
Drive repeat business with gentle nudges.
3. Catalog Alerts

Catalog Alerts delivers personalized, timely recommendations to users by monitoring changes in your catalog, such as price or quantity variations, and analyzing user interactions. When the catalog refreshes, it detects significant differences and can generate tailored alerts for targeted campaigns with personalized content that can boost engagement and drive conversions.

Example use-cases
Price drop alerts
Selling fast alerts
Back-in-stock alerts

Item Attribute Model
Introduction

The Item Attributes recommendation model allows you to create rule-based recommendations by applying catalog item attribute filters. This allows you to customize recommendations based on your marketing goals, whether promoting specific items or providing personalized suggestions based on user profiles.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Before you proceed, you must add a catalog. For more information, refer to Catalogs.

Generic Rules

Generic rules use item attributes and are not personalized. They promote new arrivals, seasonal items, and specific brand or category promotions to many users. By leveraging item attributes, businesses align recommendations with marketing objectives and increase visibility.

Example Use Cases

Reveal the 'New arrivals' section.
Inspire with your branded collection.
Celebrate with our festive picks.
Targeted Rules

Targeted rules filter item attributes based on user profiles to deliver tailored suggestions aligned with each user's characteristics. This ensures relevant recommendations suitable for specific user profiles.

Example Use Cases

Recommend ideal jobs matched to users' skills
Locate the local restaurants near your customers.

Geo-location Rules

Geo-location rules help provide location-specific recommendations. These rules can be used to suggest items or services that are available near the user's current location or a custom-defined location.

Example Use Cases

Suggest nearby restaurants, stores, or services based on the user's current location.
Suggest nearby listed properties based on the user's current location.
Filters

The filter settings allow you to refine the recommendations shown to your customers. These filters work alongside the item attribute model rule to enhance the relevance of the suggested items.

You can filter items in two ways:

Keep Items: This filter allows you to define user action criteria that will include only those items that are common in both the results of item attribute rules and user action filter criteria.
Remove Items: This filter allows you to define user action criteria that will remove items from the results of item attribute rules.
info	

Information




The final product calculation after applying recommendation filters looks as follows:

A = products from the core recommendation filter
Keep items:

B = products from the 'keep item' filter setting
Final result = A ∩ B
Remove items:
C = products from the 'remove item' filter setting
Final result = A ∩ B - C

Example use cases

Recommend items from the Ethnic wear category, but remove those that the individual users have added to their cart in the past 7 days.
Recommend Flash Deals items, but keep only those items that the individual users have added to their wishlist in the past 14 days.
Recommend properties in the user's location, but remove those that the user has visited in the past 30 days.
Recommend movies, but exclude those that the user has watched in the past 30 days.

Catalog Alerts Workflow

The Catalog Alerts feature calculates the change in price or quantity when a campaign is sent to users by comparing the current value in the catalog with the value from previous interactions.

For example, John has engaged in the following interactions within the last 30 days, as of April 30, 12:00 PM.

User Actions	Interacted Item ID	Interacted Price	Interaction Time
Added to Wishlist	P007	$29.50	April 30, 7:45 AM
Product Viewed	P007	$29.50	April 30, 7:30 AM
Added to Wishlist	P006	$15.00	April 28, 12:00 AM
Added to Wishlist	P005	$40.00	April 27, 11:55 PM
Product Viewed	P005	$40.00	April 27, 11:00 PM
Product Purchased	P004	$48.80	April 21, 9:00 AM
Added to Cart	P004	$48.80	April 20, 8:55 AM
Added to Wishlist	P002	$129.99	April 20, 11:10 AM
Removed from Wishlist	P002	$129.99	April 19, 11:15 AM
Added to Wishlist	P004	$50.00	April 18, 1:10 PM
Product Viewed	P004	$50.00	April 18, 12:00 PM
Added to Wishlist	P002	$119.99	April 18, 11:55 AM
Product Viewed	P002	$129.99	April 15, 11:00 AM
Added to Wishlist	P001	$29.99	April 1, 5:30 PM
Product Viewed	P001	$29.99	April 1, 5:00 PM

Analysis of John's Interactions:

To determine the relevant items for Catalog Alerts, MoEngage analyzes John's most recent interactions:

Item P001 was wishlisted more than 15 days prior and will not be considered.
Item P002 has two interactions; the most recent, on April 20 at 11:10 AM, will be used for price drop comparison.

Catalog Items (as on April 30, 10:00 AM Refresh):

Assume the catalog is refreshed every 12 hours. Here is a list of catalog items and their prices after the first refresh on April 30 at 10:00 AM. Item P004 was purchased in the last 15 days and will be excluded.

User actions	Interacted item ID	Interacted price	Interacted time
Added to Wishlist	P007	$29.50	April 30, 8:00 AM
Added to Wishlist	P006	$15.00	April 28, 12:00 AM
Added to Wishlist	P005	$40.00	April 27, 11:55 PM
Product Purchased	P004	$48.80	April 21, 9:00 AM
Added to Wishlist	P002	$129.99	April 20, 11:10 AM
Added to Wishlist	P004	$50.00	April 18, 1:10 PM

Based on the price changes and John's interactions, the recommended items are calculated as follows:

Id	Title	…	Price
P001	Wireless Ergonomic Mouse	…	$24.99
P002	Noise Cancelling Headphones	…	$99.00
P003	Adjustable Laptop Stand	…	$35.50
P004	Bluetooth Portable Speaker	…	$45.75
P005	Blue Light Blocking Glasses	…	$25.00
P006	Desk Organizer with Pen Holder	…	$11.50
P007	USB-C to HDMI Adapter	…	$19.90
P008	Micro SD Card - 128GB	…	$22.99
P009	Wireless Charging Pad	…	$20.00
P010	Portable Power Bank - 10000mAh	…	$28.00

Calculate Recommended Items: 

To determine the price change, we compare the current price with the price at the time of the last interaction. This comparison can be done in two ways:

By Value: The difference is calculated as: current price - last interacted price.
By Percent: The percentage change is calculated as: ((current price - last interacted price) * 100) / current price.

Following this logic, in our example,

Items P002, P005, and P007 are finalized for recommendation because they each show a price drop greater than 30%.
Item P004, with only a ~20% price drop, does not meet this criterion and is therefore excluded.
Interacted Item ID	Interacted Price	Current Price	Change Type (Percent)
P007	$29.50	$19.90	-48.2%
P006	$15.00	$12.50	-20.0%
P005	$40.00	$25.00	-60.0%
P002	$129.99	$99.00	-31.3%

Finally, MoEngage will sort these recommendation results by percent change type. The final list of recommendations will be in the following order:

Interacted Item ID	Title	Change Type (Percent)
P005	Blue Light Blocking Glasses	-60.0%
P007	USB-C to HDMI Adapter	-48.2%
P002	Noise Cancelling Headphones	-31.3%

Additionally, any item attribute filter will be applied to these items to refine the results as per the recommendation setup.

Business Event Trigger

A Business Event Trigger setup allows you to generate a business event following the first change detected in a catalog.

The generated event's naming convention follows the format: Catalog_Alerts_{{Recommendation_Name}}. For the provided example, the generated event name would be Catalog_Alerts_PriceDropAlerts.

You can use these events to automate user alerts or campaigns by creating business event campaigns in real time following the first change detected in the defined catalog attribute. For more information, refer to creating business event trigger campaign.

In this setup, the catalog is refreshed twice daily, say at 10:00 AM and 10:00 PM, but the business event will be triggered only at 10:00 AM after a successful refresh. However, you can configure other types of campaigns using the same recommendation setup at any schedule or delivery method, independent of the business event trigger.

Campaign Personalization

When you use Catalog Alerts, an additional attribute, the last interaction value is available for personalization. This value works with the current catalog attribute to clearly show users the difference in value within campaigns.

For example, the {{last_interaction_price}} placed next to the catalog {{price}} shows the actual difference in the price that has been detected, presenting higher confidence to click the campaign:"

It's like the detective of recommendations. Sherpa AI finds hidden links between items, showing you what others often view in tandem, and making cross-selling a breeze. we present cross-selling opportunities you didn't know existed.

Model Ingredients:
User Action events: Product Viewed

Example Use Cases
Provide users with relevant product bundles or packages.
Increase sales and engagement by suggesting additional related products or services.

Frequently Bought Together Items

Enhance the shopping experience by suggesting items that are often bought together, paving the way for upselling and bundled convenience. This model is more of a savvy shopkeeper who always knows the perfect bundle of items that usually find their way to the checkout counter together.

Model Ingredients:
User Action events: Product Purchased

Example Use Cases
Suggest complementary products or services to increase sales and engagement.
Improve customer satisfaction by anticipating their needs and providing relevant suggestions to complete their purchase.
Popular Items

The crowd-pleasers. When in doubt, turn to what’s trending. Find out which items are creating the buzz. These social butterfly recommendations are defined as default fallback. For the newbies with no prior interactions, these items will be your welcoming committee, ensuring your new buyers are always in the loop.

Model Ingredients:
User Action events: Product Viewed, Add to Wishlist, Add to Cart, Product Purchased

info	

Note

These recommendations are stitched as the default fallback for all the Advanced recommendations models and are served if a user has not engaged with any items in the last 2 months.
 
Example Use Cases
Activate new users by exhibiting trends in your platform.
Help discover new and popular products or services that they may be interested in.
Filters

The filter settings allow you to refine the recommendations shown to your customers. These filters work in addition to the recommended model logic to enhance the relevance of the suggested items.

User action filters

The filter settings allow you to fine-tune the recommendations shown to your customers based on their own interaction activities. You can filter items in two ways:

Keep Items: This filter allows you to define user action criteria that will include only those items that are common in both the results of item attribute rules and user action filter criteria.
Remove Items: This filter allows you to define user action criteria that will remove items from the results of item attribute rules.

Information




The final product calculation after applying recommendation filters looks as follows:

A = products from the core recommendation filter
Keep items:

B = products from the 'keep item' filter setting
Final result = A ∩ B
Remove items:
C = products from the 'remove item' filter setting
Final result = A ∩ B - C
Example use cases
Recommend a frequently bought together bundle but remove the items added to the cart.
Keep only those Recommended items that the user has viewed in the last 30 days.
Remove the viewed items from the Frequently viewed together items list to encourage new product discovery.
Remove the items that the user has already added to wishlist from Similar items recommendations.
Item attribute filters

The filter settings allow you to refine the recommendations shown to your customers based on information available in catalog.

Recommend the similar properties in users’ location
Recommend frequently bought together bundle available in stock where price is less than $10
frequently viewed together Items on sale
Recommended Items of a specific brand alone"

info	

Note

For each model, there should be a minimum of 1000 user action events where a minimum of 25 unique users should have performed 2 interactions each. It's essential to note that this is only the minimum criteria for the model to function. The more data you have, the better results your model will yield.
Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network (HRNN)

HRNN identifies patterns in how users interact with different items on your platform. By doing so, it can predict which item a user is likely to be interested in next, based on their past behavior. This approach assumes that if user A has the same opinion as user B (where B is a similar user in terms of interaction patterns) in a session, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different session than that of a random user.

User Behavior Patterns: The key to HRNN's effectiveness is its ability to deduce relationships between items based on their interaction patterns, even if the items don't have explicit attributes linking them. These patterns might include which items are viewed together or in close sequence.
Embedding Layers: In HRNN, both users and items are represented by embeddings, which are dense vectors of floating-point values. The model uses these embeddings to represent the 'closeness' of items and users in a high-dimensional space. Items that are frequently interacted with by users are positioned closer to each other in this space.
Recurrent Layers: The HRNN uses recurrent layers to remember patterns across long sequences of data, allowing it to make better predictions and identify complex relationships between items. The timestamp of the interaction event gives the temporal edge to recommendations beyond sequences.
Collaborative Filtering

Item-item collaborative filtering is a specific approach focusing on the relationships between items rather than between users. Item-item collaborative filtering tends to be more stable (but less personalized) than Similar User behavior models because item preferences change less frequently than user preferences.

This approach examines the co-interactions of users with items and then determines the similarity of items at a global level based on interaction data. To give an idea, refer to the following basic interpretation of how the computation is done.

User ID	Item ID	Timestamp
U1	P1	2023-07-23 11:24:02.112
U1	P2	2023-07-24 12:20:05.096
U1	P3	2023-08-12 04:34:34.234
U2	P1	2023-07-05 12:30:00.090
U2	P2	2023-08-02 14:45:45.010
U3	P1	2023-08-25 15:52.12.020
U4	P4	2023-08-24 05:52.12.020
U4	P1	2023-06-24 03:25.12.020
U4	P2	2023-07-09 06:37.25.100
U4	P5	2023-08-04 09:35.14.080
U4	P1	2023-06-24 01:25.12.456
U5	P2	2023-07-14 04:15.22.030
U5	P4	2023-08-04 10:25.12.120

This can be transformed to an item-item matrix based on no of users who interacted with the items, as following

 	P1	P2	P3	P4	P5
P1	5	4	1	2	1
P2	4	4	1	2	1
P3	1	1	1	0	0
P4	2	2	0	2	1
P5	1	1	0	1	1

Hence, excluding the relationship of the item with itself, the recommendation results will be as follows:

Anchor item (last interacted item)	Results from Collaborative filtering
P1	P2, P4, P3, P5
P2	P1, P4, P3, P5
P3	P1, P2
P4	P1, P2, P5
P5	P1, P2, P4

Note: the above explanation is merely a basic representation of logic. The actual algorithm is much more complicated than this.

Item Attributes Similarity

To capture the relationships among items, the item metadata embedding is created for each item ID that is essentially represented in multi-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a hidden variable or latent factor. These embeddings represent the attributes of the items, such as genre or category.

After generating item embeddings from user-item interactions and item metadata, they're merged in a fusion layer. This layer, during training, learns to adjust weights based on item characteristics and user preferences. It decides the importance of embeddings from user interactions versus those from item metadata. Through a deep learning model, it effectively balances recommendations by weighing both interaction data and item metadata similarities.

Popularity Count

Popularity count is a weighted aggregation-based model, but it suggests the most popular items based on overall interaction counts. This plays a role of fallback for scenarios where historical data is minimal or unavailable."

Prerequisites 

Before you proceed, you must map the user actions and add a catalog. For more information, refer to User Actions and Catalogs.  

Go to Content > Recommendations from the left navigation. The Recommendations page is displayed.
Click Create recommendations. The Create recommendation page is displayed.


Select the relevant model according to your use case and click Next.

In the Recommendation name field, enter a name for the recommendation.
In the Recommendation description field, enter a description for the recommendation
In the Catalog drop-down list, select the relevant catalog from which you wish to retrieve these recommendations.
Note: All AI recommendations consider one catalog. After you use a catalog in any AI recommendations, it will be automatically configured for all other types of AI recommendations.
Choose the relevant user actions based on your use case from the drop-down list.
In the case of Similar items, Frequently bought together items, and Frequently viewed together items, the recent most item based on the configured user action events will be used to generate.
In the case of Recommended items, you are not required to configure any user actions. All performed user actions by a user are considered to learn their behavior patterns automatically and the recommendations are generated tailored to the shifting interests of individuals.
Turn the Filter items by user actions toggle on to add filtering criteria and control which items to recommend to their customers. These filters are applied to the results of the core recommendation further. You will see two types of filters for user actions:


Select user action to keep items: Marketers can define the user action criteria that includes only those items that are common in filtering user action criteria and recommendation results. Click + User actions and select the items to be included.

Select user action to remove items: Marketers can define the user action criteria that removes the items according to the filtering user action criteria from recommendation items. Click + User actions and select the items to be excluded.
Turn the Filter items by item attributes toggle on to add filtering criteria based on catalog information. These filters are also applied to the results of the core recommendation further. 
Click Save. A recommendation is created with a 'Processing' state on the Recommendations page. It can take a maximum of 24 hours for recommendations to be active.

After the recommendation is ready, you can test results for sample users before using it in any campaign.
Best Practices
Choose the global catalog inclusive of all the business offerings or the type of offerings you want to generate recommendations for.
Map all relevant events in the relevant user action buckets.
Ensure that the unique item ID attribute has the same information as the unique item ID in the catalog.
Configure all possible user-item interactions in the Recommended Items settings, such as Product Viewed, Added to Wishlist, Added to Cart, and Product Purchased. This allows the algorithm to learn from a wide range of user behaviors and adapt to rapid changes.
Test the results for sample users before incorporating them into your campaign."

Landing Pages 
Getting Started with Landing Pages
Overview

A landing page is a dedicated webpage designed to capture customer's attention when they click on a published campaign.

These pages are crucial for driving a customer towards a desired outcome, be it a product purchase, event registration, or opting in for additional information. They are an effective way to transform quality leads from a campaign into actionable engagements.

For marketers, landing pages play a pivotal role as they catalyze increased web traffic and uplift conversion rates.

Why use Landing Pages

Regular web pages are static and typically have many goals and encourage exploration on the website. By using custom personalized landing pages, you can have a minimal page tailored to a specific customer segment. Using this minimized approach will help you keep the visitors focused on the conversion goal and avoid any distractions.

Landing pages seamlessly complement other MoEngage strategies such as Push, E-mail, SMS, In-app, and web campaigns. This facilitates a smooth transition for users from an email or notification to a landing page for more detailed information, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

Personalize a Landing Page
Data Personalization

MoEngage offers powerful personalization options for your landing page. You can personalize the landing page's content or image by using @. You can create highly targeted and effective landing pages by integrating these personalization methods. You can personalize the content using User Attributes, User Events, Product Sets, Content APIs, and Content Blocks.

To personalize a landing page, perform the following steps:

After choosing your template, click the text box or the image property URL.
Type @ anywhere in the text area to add the attributes.
Similarly, you can personalize an image by clicking the button.

The Landing Page Personalization window appears.

On the Data personalization tab, choose one of the attributes from the following types:

User Attributes
Product Sets
Content API (modify the values of the parameters of the Content API)

On the Content Block tab:

Select the content block from the list.
Turn the Insert only the content of the content block toggle on. Doing so will disconnect the content from the content block, and any future updates will not be reflected on the page.
After selecting the attribute or the content block, you can edit your Jinja code in the text area. 
Click Done once you have edited the changes.

You can click the personalization from the field to edit it again. Don't select another attribute from the list for your personalization. Doing so will replace the entire Jinja code in the text box.

Choose Fallback

You can choose one of the following as an alternate (Fallback) to the personalization:

No fallback: This option results in no alternates when the personalization does not work.
Replace text: Type or paste the text to use when the personalization does not work.
info	

Note

Ensure that custom attributes do not have the same names as MoEngage standard attributes. If a custom attribute and a standard attribute having the same name are used for personalization, it could result in incorrect personalization.

Dynamic Text Replacement

Dynamic Text Replacement allows you to automatically modify text elements on a landing page based on URL query parameters. Using this feature, you can dynamically replace specific text elements (like headings, button text, or paragraphs) within your landing page. This enables you to create hyper-personalized content, tailoring it to the context of the user's arrival on the page. 

Use Cases 
Displaying a specific promotion mentioned in an ad campaign's UTM parameter (for example, utm_campaign=summer_sale or utm_campaign=winter_sale ). The resolution is based on the parameter's value.
Displaying location-specific information based on a query parameter (for example, region=asia).
Personalizing greetings or offers based on the traffic source (for example, source=facebook).

To configure Dynamic Text Replacement, perform the following steps:

After choosing your landing page template, type @ in the desired text area. The Landing Page Personalization window appears.
Click the Dynamic text replacement tab.

From the UTM Parameter list, select an existing query parameter name. If the parameter you need isn't listed, you can create a new one by typing the parameter name (for example, offer), as shown below.

In the Choose Fallback section, you can decide what to display if the specified UTM parameter is missing from the page URL or has no value:
Replace with user attribute (Optional): To fallback to a specific user attribute value, select the desired user attribute from the list.
Replace text: To fallback to a static text string, type the desired fallback text in the Fallback text box.
Click Done.

The created query parameter will be visible in the URL and settings section.

After the landing page is published, query parameters will be added to the landing page URL. You can define multiple parameters within a single landing page (for example, {location}, {product}, etc.), each replaced dynamically.

How Does Personalization Work?

Personalizing your landing page helps you create connected experiences in real-time. You can integrate these personalized landing pages with other campaigns, such as E-mail, OSM, and In-App messages, and direct your users to them.

Once you have published the landing page with personalized elements, you can use the page's URL across other channels. The URL will consist of the domain name, landing page path, and a query parameter starting with moe_aid, which will include the user attribute.

For example, in a landing page URL
https://landing-pages.mnge.co/Journey/example?moe_aid={{UserAttribute['aid']}}


landing-pages.mnge.co is the domain name
/Journey/example is the landing page path
moe_aid={{UserAttribute['aid']}} is the query parameter

Consider a case where you want to use your on-site message campaign to direct your customers to their personalized landing page. To do this, use the URL in the OSM campaign. When the user clicks it, the system replaces the query parameter {{UserAttribute['aid']}} with that user's ID in an encrypted format. MoEngage landing pages decrypt this ID to display personalized content. If user attribute resolution fails, the fallback text is shown.

Overview
Introduction

Coupon-driven marketing strategies are powerful for businesses to boost customer engagement, increase sales, and improve customer retention and loyalty. Coupons can be sent to specific cohorts, such as new users for activation, inactive users for resurrection, or users who abandoned a purchase to complete it for incentives.

MoEngage Coupons simplify allocating and distributing single-use coupons to eligible users.

What Are Single-Use Coupon Codes?

Single-use coupon codes are unique coupons distributed to individual customers as part of a marketing strategy that ensures that no two users receive the same coupon and can use these coupons only once.

Traditionally, marketing campaigns predominantly relied on generic coupon codes accessible to all customers. However, such campaigns fell short of delivering a personalized experience and were frequently prone to misuse and fraud. Single-use coupon codes thereby offer some added benefits in comparison to generic coupons.

Benefits

Single-use coupon codes offer several benefits.

Enhanced customer experience: These single-use coupon codes make customers feel special and valued, enhancing customer engagement and loyalty.
Boosts sales: By offering personalized deals, these codes increase the likelihood of purchases, driving sales and revenue.
Increased promotional ROI: With static coupon codes, businesses have less control over their distribution and usage. Multiple customers can widely share and use the same code, making it difficult to limit or control its usage. Whereas, with single-use codes, businesses can control the number of coupons distributed and redeemed by whom, ensuring they don't exceed their budgetary allowance for discounts.
Reduced promotional abuse: Single-use coupon codes are provisioned to a specific customer, making it easier to control and monitor their usage, thus preventing coupon fraud.
Fosters customer loyalty: Offering personalized deals encourages repeat purchases, fostering long-term customer loyalty.
Urgency creation: The temporary nature of these codes generates a sense of urgency, leading to immediate redemptions.
Precise customer behavior tracking: By assigning these coupons to each customer, businesses can track who uses the codes, when, and what they're purchasing, thereby enabling a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior.
Use Cases

Single-use coupon codes are used in various scenarios.

Rewarding loyal customers: These coupon codes can be used to reward loyal customers, encourage repeat purchases, and foster long-term loyalty.
Driving email list signups: These codes can be used as an incentive to drive sign-ups for email lists, expanding the customer base for future marketing efforts.
Increasing urgency: Because the codes are temporary and unique, they can be used to create a sense of urgency, leading to immediate redemptions.
Personalized promotions: The codes can be used to offer personalized promotions, increasing the likelihood of conversions.
Customized marketing campaigns: These coupon codes can be used to run customized marketing campaigns targeting specific segments of customers.
What Can You Do with the Coupons Platform?

MoEngage allows marketers to easily import coupons (generated by their internal promo engines or third-party platforms) and distribute them to the users while managing a usage report for audit and debugging. Additionally, it offers proactive monitoring and alerting on coupon availability and expiry.

Coupon lifecycle management: MoEngage allows the management of coupon lists after being created from your internal or vendor platform. This includes importing, deleting, activating, managing expiry, alerts, allocation to users, and maintaining the distribution report for audit.
Alert system: This feature equips businesses with proactive oversight of coupon availability during campaigns. The alert system diligently oversees the status of coupon imports, remaining coupon count, and expiry dates, and triggers email alerts when specific criteria are fulfilled.
Coupon code distribution: MoEngage allows seamless distribution of single-use coupon codes, enhancing personalization in marketing campaigns whether . These can be bulk campaigns or targeted campaigns.
Analytics and alerting: MoEngage provides insights on the total and remaining coupons and alerts when the count of remaining coupons is low or if coupon list expiry is approaching.
Audit report: Although MoEngage doesn't manage redemption validation, it tracks the distribution and allocation to individual users for each coupon to ensure that single-use coupons are not distributed more than once.

MoEngage also offers an extensive list of APIs for managing coupons that can be seamlessly integrated, reducing the need for manual intervention. You can use these APIs to add, manage, or audit coupons from your internal systems to MoEngage."

Add Coupons to MoEngage
Introduction

On the Coupons page, you can create, manage, and track your coupon lists for your marketing campaigns and flows. To ensure coupon availability for campaigns, you can add more coupons to a coupon list proactively:

Coupon lists: This is the repository of one type of all coupons stored within the system. It contains only the single-use coupon code for each coupon. These lists serve as the foundation for all coupon-related operations. MoEngage allows you to create multiple coupon lists, enabling you to maintain distinct lists for different types of codes or various campaigns.
Coupon files: You can add coupons to an existing Coupon list by importing a coupon file. You can upload a coupon file directly from the dashboard or automate the task through the Coupons API for a more efficient and streamlined import process. This feature ensures your coupon lists are consistently updated and ready for deployment in your marketing campaigns.

MoEngage does not manage the creation of codes. In the context of coupon-based campaigns, the role of MoEngage is to allocate single-use coupon codes and distribute them throughout the configured marketing channels. 

Prerequisites

While MoEngage focuses on streamlining the distribution and management of promotional codes, it expects you to generate and implement redemption validation at your end. You can create coupon codes from third-party tools or your internal systems and compile them into a CSV file. You can import this coupon file to the MoEngage Coupons platform to send these coupon-based campaigns.

Merlin AI Copywriter
Overview

Merlin AI utilizes Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to generate high-quality written content for Push marketing campaigns. The prime objective is to assist customers in creating engaging marketing campaigns without the manual effort of research, analysis, and content refinement. Furthermore, Merlin AI for copywriting enables rapid testing of different messaging strategies, ultimately leading to better campaign performance. So what makes it special?

LLM-inspired creativity: Borrowing the unmatched brilliance of large language models (LLM), get content that is not just accurate but also creatively engaging. Imagine sending a message crafted with the genius of Yoda or the flair of Steve Jobs!
Keyword analysis: Merlin AI delves extensively into data and consistently gains knowledge from past campaigns. This enables it to power your messages using high-performing keywords that aid in maximizing future results.
Easy-to-use prompt builder: Marketers need not engineer prompts because we have done that for them. All you need is to enter context variables. The flow is directly tied with the campaign builder of MoEngage in addition to analyzed keywords.

The tool is designed to understand the business context, brand tone, style, target audience to deliver relevant content that drives user engagement in the language you want.

Keyword Analysis

In a world where every word can sway decisions, Merlin AI ensures that the right words are chosen. By leveraging the Keyword Impact Quotient (KIQ), marketers gain insights into which terms have proven effective, exemplified by keywords with a positive KIQ indicating a history of uplift in engagement.

High-performing keywords: These keywords have historically proven to be more effective in engagement. Including these keywords in your content can drive more clicks. For example, if the keyword 'Lorem' boasts a KIQ of 100%, it signifies that all general Push campaigns had 100% higher CTR compared to on average in past engagements.
Low-performing keywords: While shining a light on stars, Merlin also flags potential pitfalls. The system identifies low-performing keywords, ensuring marketers steer clear of terms that might hamper campaign effectiveness. For example, if the keyword 'Ipsum' has a KIQ of -50%, it signifies that campaigns with 'Ipsum' keywords have -50% lesser engagement.
info	

Note

Merlin AI needs at least one general Push campaign with 1000 impressions and 100 clicks to run keyword analysis. In the absence of this criterion, some generic fallback keywords are suggested.

Easy-to-Use Prompt Builder

At the heart of Merlin AI Copywriter lies its innovative prompt builder. It is a tool designed not for engineers but for creators because we are doing the prompt engineering. Merging the power of LLM with historical campaign performance data, the prompt builder does not just create; it predicts what works. 

Merlin offers a range of pre-defined templates, offering users a quick start. But for those looking to add a personal touch, customization options abound. Merlin's prompt builder allows users to input placeholder values, ensuring the generated content aligns perfectly with the campaign's intent.

From the prompt builder, you can define the campaign use case, required keywords, definition target audience, intended campaign tone, and the messaging style.

Campaign use case or objective: This input refers to the specific goal or purpose of your Push campaign. Examples of campaign objectives include promoting a new product, driving website traffic, or increasing sales.
Target audience: This input refers to the group of users that you want to target with your Push message. You can select specific user segments and filters based on user behavior, demographics, or other criteria.
Impactful keywords: Merlin AI suggests high-performing or low-performing keywords based on their historical correlation with engagement. You can choose to include or exclude these keywords in the generated messages. You can also add new words in the context by entering and selecting a keyword. You can select a maximum of three keywords from the list of recommended keywords.
Message tone: This input refers to the overall mood or emotion that you want to convey through your Push message, for example, FOMO, Persuasive, Casual, and so on.
Message style: This input refers to the writing style or format of your Push message. By selecting this input, you can define if the message needs to be generated in a certain style. The scope of this input is limitless. We have provided certain suggestions in the form of Trends, Persona, Pop-culture references, or even Archetypes and Literature.
Message language: The language input feature in the Merlin prompt builder allows you to select your desired language from the dropdown menu. This enables you to generate messages in a language that's most suitable for your target audience.

While the campaign use case or scenario is the only mandatory input, providing as much campaign context as possible can help Merlin AI generate more accurate and effective Push messages. By entering these campaign values, you can ensure that your Push message aligns with your brand's tone and style and resonates with your target audience."

Merlin AI Segmentation
 	

Early Access

This is an Early Access feature. To enable it for your account, contact your CSM or raise a support ticket.

Introduction

Merlin AI segmentation allows you to create segments easily by entering prompts in simple English. Finding the right events and the right combination of filters to create a segment is no longer your effort. Merlin AI segmentation crafts the most suitable segments based on your prompt, which can be edited right before segment creation.

Merlin AI segmentation operates at two levels:

Create the query structure: With GPT 3.5 capabilities, Merlin AI can accurately analyze the structure of the MoEngage query language.
Map relevant user and event attributes: With Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Merlin AI segmentation efficiently bridges natural language inputs with corresponding event or user attributes for a particular workspace.
Segmentation with Merlin AI

Perform the following actions to use Merlin AI to simplify your segment creation process:

Create a segment with Merlin AI
Optimize your AI-generated queries
Create a Segment 

Perform the following steps to create a segment with Merlin AI:

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Segment > Create segment.
Click Use Merlin AI to create segments. You can switch back to the filter view by clicking Go to Filter view to manually generate a query.
In the Type to create a segment section, enter your prompt. For more information, refer to the Guidelines to Write Effective Prompts. 
Click this icon to generate a query. The results of your queries generated with AI will be listed on the MerlinAI tab in the Query results section.
A few sample prompts are listed under the Prompts to Get You Started section for your reference. 

To find more prompts, click Explore more prompts.
You can edit the prompts as required after selecting the sample prompts.
To create a segment with the generated query, click Create custom segment.

In the MerlinAI tab of the Query results action, you can provide your feedback using the thumbs-up and thumbs-down options below each query.
When you click the thumbs-down option, the Feedback dialogue box will appear.
Enter the prompt you are looking for and click Submit.

Your feedback helps MoEngage provide better query results that are suitable for your prompt through AI.
Optimize Your AI-Generated Queries

You can optimize your Merlin AI-generated queries by regenerating them, which provides new query results with different filters for the same prompt.

After the query is generated, check the filter condition described under Showing users for. If the filters do not match your requirements, click Regenerate. Merlin AI will generate a new query with different filters. On regeneration, Merlin AI tries to map the next nearest event or user attribute as per your prompt.

Optimize the Query in Filter View

The filter view opens your queries with filters, which allows you to add additional filters (such as nested filters and affinity queries) to your Merlin AI-generated query.

Click Open in filter view to edit queries using filters manually. This result will be listed under the Filters tab in the Query Results section. For more information on creating segments manually, click here.
Once the query is generated, you can create segments or campaigns by clicking + Action.

Guidelines to Write Effective Prompts

The guidelines and prompt structures to write effective prompts are discussed below:

info	

Things to know

Refer to the key concepts of segmentation at MoEngage before using a query with Merlin AI segmentation.
User attributes and user activity (events and event attributes) are the building blocks of segmentation.
Filters are used to filter specific user attributes and events.
Operators (AND/OR) are used to combine multiple segment blocks.
Prompt Structures

The following are the best prompt structures with examples:

You must query events (user behavior) and user attributes (user property) with different prompts to generate the most accurate filters.
Apply the following structure for querying user attributes:
Segment users whose city/country/email ID/mobile number, etc, is <value>. For example, Segment users who are in New York City.
Apply the following structure for querying events:
Segment users who have done/performed an <event> in the last n days. For example, Segment users who opened the app in the last 7 days.
Apply the following structure for querying events with event attributes:
Segment users who have done/performed a <event> with <event attribute> containing <value>. For example, segment users who have updated the app in the last 15 days with app versions containing 2.3.
Apply the following structure for querying users who have not performed a certain event:
Segment users who have not done/performed a <event> with <event attribute> containing <value>. For example, segment users who have not updated the app in the last 15 days.
Joining queries with AND/OR
You can combine user attributes and events using an AND or OR as required by your business logic.
Apply the following structure for queries combining user attributes and events in the following order: user attributes first, followed by events.
Segment users whose <user attribute> is <value> and who have done an <event> in the last few days. For example, segment users who are in New York City and have opened the app in the last 30 days.
Sample Prompts to Get You Started

For a better understanding of prompt structure and usage, some of the sample prompts are listed as follows:

7-day active users: Segment users who opened the app in the last 7 days.
Users from a city: Segment users who are in New York City.
Perform an action: Segment users who opened an email last week.
Number of actions: Segment users who have clicked a push notification at least 5 times in the last 30 days.
Joint conditions: Segment users who are in New York City and who have opened the app in the last 30 days.
Did not perform an action: Segment users who have not updated the app in the last 15 days.
Channel Interactions: Segment users who have clicked a notification from an Android device at least once in the last 3 days.
For the first time: Segment users who have opened the app for the first time in the last 30 days.
Data validation: Segment users whose email IDs are not available.
Starts with: Segment users whose mobile number starts with +91.
Ends with: Segment users whose email ID ends with education.
Contains a substring: Segment users whose email ID contains @moengage.
Contains multiple substrings: Segment users whose email ID contains @moengage, @gmail, @hotmail.
Numerical actions: Segment users who opened the app in the last 3 days with an app version greater than 16.1.

Our Approach to Generative AI
Overview

MoEngage’s Merlin AI suite is the future of productivity and content creation for marketing teams.

Our commitment is to provide an environment that ensures high availability and tight security for your content creation needs. We strive to maintain transparency about our security practices to ensure you understand our security-by-design approach. Merlin AI guides the generative strategy towards safety, security, and growth by utilizing the world's leading AI models and our internal proprietary algorithms. 

Security isn't just a feature of our product, but an inherent part of our identity. It informs every decision we make and has been integral to our product since inception. This includes the data we collect, its usage, and the entities with whom we share it.

MoEngage Architecture

We strictly adhere to internal AI usage standards. Our design ensures customer data is kept separate from our model providers. Thus, no sensitive information is shared with 3rd party service providers at any stage. The intent of this policy is not to limit creativity or innovation but rather to ensure the usage of AI aligns with the company values and safeguards our customers' rights.

Merlin AI architecture allows for custom authentication protocols, complete control over access to global knowledge, and yet customization of generation, credits, and usage policy on an account level.

We provide secure access through account login, which is accessible only to employees authorized for campaign creation, thereby preventing misuse. This means access and permissions are granted strictly based on employees' job requirements.
As a built-in feature, Merlin AI offers advanced security and privacy measures, assuring you of data security and confidentiality without requiring additional setup or configurations. You can certainly be at peace, knowing that your information will always be secure with Merlin.

Merlin AI operates in collaboration with two systems that function asynchronously:

Learning from client data: The intelligence within the first system is handled by MoEngage, which utilizes our proprietary algorithms to learn from past campaign data, their results, user actions, and customer preferences within a customer's workspace. This process strictly excludes the use of generative AI. For example, the Merlin AI copywriter leverages the Keyword Impact Quotient (KIQ) algorithm to glean insights into which keywords have historically been effective in campaign messaging within a workspace. 
Foundational Generative AI Models: For foundational models, we rely upon 3rd party tools. This system produces outputs for the users’ requests. Users can include suggestions informed by MoEngage’s algorithms drawn from previous campaigns and user data. Users may or may not choose to use the suggestions. Ensuring maximum confidentiality, we never share account details, business names, or any other personal information with our AI partners.
Our AI Partners

We take great pride in partnering with Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web service and Stability AI to provide industry-best privacy controls, giving you complete authority over your data. 

The Amazon Web service creates a secure environment, particularly beneficial when handling sensitive information. The AWS emphasizes network isolation and facilitates managing and learning from the data point specific to your account e.g. keyword analysis. These learnings, then, without any specific PII or account information, can be passed on to Merlin AI by you as one of the input while using the feature.

Microsoft Azure deploys a stratified series of mitigations across four layers, following Microsoft's responsible AI standard. Technical provisions such as input and output content filtering aid in detecting harmful content. The latest research advancements have provided another layer of security such that the safety mechanism has been directly integrated into the generative models, improving the model's ability to manage harmful inputs and reducing the probability of generating a harmful response.

Stability.ai releases AI models as open code; allowing researchers and authorities to examine the model's operation for transparency. Likewise, the provided open datasets invite robust scrutiny for quality, fairness, and bias. When it comes to their applications and APIs, Stability.ai deploys comprehensive filters to process prompts and outputs, screening for any unsafe content that contradicts their platform's terms of service. Furthermore, Stability AI is introducing content authenticity norms and watermarking to help users and platforms identify content created with their hosted services.

info	

Information

Security features are inherently incorporated into Merlin AI models to avoid any misuse of AI. Depending on the specific use case, these safety protections are either built-in native to our partner models or independently implemented by us.

Merlin AI does not exhibit any bias based on gender, race, age, or any other factors.

Your prompts (inputs) and completions (outputs), your embeddings, and your training data:

are NOT available to other customers.
are NOT used to improve foundation models provided by partners.
are NOT used to improve any 3rd party products or services.

Also, about open AI models, the Azure OpenAI Service is fully controlled by Microsoft. Microsoft hosts the OpenAI models in Microsoft’s Azure environment and the Service does NOT interact with any services operated by OpenAI (e.g. ChatGPT, or the OpenAI API)

Your Responsibility

While in-build MoEngage implementation and our partners provide considerable security controls and uphold responsible AI standards, ensuring the appropriate use of the generated content ultimately resides with the customers.

Generative AI, while transformative, should not be relied upon to fully automate content creation, at least not yet. It must be leveraged as an assistive tool rather than a replacement for human judgment. Our policy and design underscores the need for human intervention and review, ensuring that content generated by AI is not published without evaluation for quality and accuracy.

Conclusion 

Ensuring the security and privacy of customer information is vital to our company mission. The success of our customers is at the core of what we do.

We and our customers hold the right to use the generated output for commercial purpose. However, it is suggested to manually review the generated content before using it in a campaign.
As part of our ongoing enhancement practices, we may choose to either increase or decrease the date range of the data retained by Merlin AI. Please note, as explained above, neither of your PII data or campaign data-pointst are shared with our partners.
We are steadfast in our commitment to safeguarding your data throughout the handling process. Your data belongs to you; it will never be sold or shared irresponsibly. 
To provide you the best possible content generation Merlin uses the best AI model possible for specific use cases. These 3rd party AI models are not trained on your data and will not be trained on your data."

Most Preferred Channel
Most Preferred Channel
Introduction

Most Preferred Channel (MPC) is a user-level parameter that denotes the channel that the users respond to from the available channels such as email, push notifications, and SMS. Instead of using multiple channels to send the same message, marketers can engage customers on the channel of their choice to get maximum engagement.

Objectives

Using MPC, marketers achieve the following business benefits:

Improve overall click rates and conversions

By sending a communication to users on their most preferred channel, marketers potentially get:

Higher impressions
Higher clicks since there is a high chance that users will view the corresponding content resulting in overall higher conversions.
Optimize marketing spend through customer interactions

Based on user propensity, you can target users who are in dire need of attention with greater frequency and personalization. Optimize marketing spend by reducing unnecessary campaigns and creating a focused outreach plan with optimized frequency.

Create targeted campaigns with greater precision and accuracy

Target customers with personalized campaigns. Identify channels that work for the users and target users based on their propensity, respond on those channels, or select campaigns. Furthermore, optimize communications based on the available data.

How is Most Preferred Channel derived?

The engagement of a user is defined both in terms of frequency and depth. For example, the number of times an email was opened against the number of times an email was clicked. MPC considers the following:

All outbound engagement with the users in the last two months.
Automatically provide engagement of a user with each channel by considering the frequency and overall count
The algorithm automatically adds more weightage to the more recent engagements against previous engagements.
MPC is defined and periodically updated for each user.
MPC Result

The Most Preferred Channel for each user is viewed in the user profile as described:

How to Use MPC in Campaigns?

Follow these steps to create and send campaigns on the most preferred channel.

MPC in Custom Segments

MPC is available on the Segmentation page under the User Property filter.

Navigate to Dashboard > Segmentation > Create Segment.
Click Filter users by.
Click User Property.
From the drop-down, select Most Preferred Channel.



Select the channel to filter and save the results as a custom filter.
After completion, the segment is saved as a custom segment and is used in campaigns.


MPC Segments in Campaigns
Create the Push Campaign
In the Target Audience, select Custom Segment and select the MPC segment created in the MPC in custom segments.

The push campaign is delivered to only the users in the custom segment. Push becomes the most preferred campaign and ensures the change in user engagement is higher.

 

Similarly, create and save the custom segments with MPC for Email and SMS in the MoEngage. Create campaigns with the custom segment filter to ensure campaigns are delivered to the users on the preferred channel."

A/B Testing 
What is A/B or Multivariate Testing
Overview

Multivariate or split testing are experiments conducted by marketers by modifying one or more variables to determine the effect of the modified variable on the other variables of a campaign.

The effect of a dependent variable on one or more independent variables:

Help predict phenomena
Explain the causal relationships between variables if there are any. 
What is A/B testing?

A/B testing also known as split testing is an experimental set-up of comparing two versions (known as variations) of a message copy against each other, by sending it to an equal number of randomly chosen groups of users, to know which one performs better to drive your engagement metrics. It is used when the comparison is done to test only one variable.

What is Multivariate testing?

Multivariate testing has more than two variations of communication sent to different users chosen at random to compare the performance of variations.

Differences between A/B or Multivariate testing

While creating an A/B or multivariate experiment, ensure that the only difference between the variations are the differences that marketers want to test upon.

For example:

If you only want to test whether Android Push Notifications with images get better CTRs than the ones without, you should create two variations with similar content with the only difference that you send out the image with one of the variations and not with the other.

Different types of user distribution
Manual User Distribution

Manual distribution is defined for a fixed set of users, analyze the variation campaign, and then send the best or winner campaign to all the users.

Marketers set the percentage of users receiving the campaign.
Marketers look at the analysis and modify the percentage as required. 

For more information, refer to Static User Distribution.

Dynamic User Distribution using Sherpa

Dynamic variation means MoEngage Sherpa automatically decides the winner campaign and sends the winning campaign to the users. 

For more information, refer to Dynamic User Distribution.

How should I split my variations?

Split is for a minimum sample size, which in turn is a function of the baseline numbers and the campaign variation you want to detect before declaring the experiment successful.

A suitable split between your variations:

Depending upon the hypothesis or the objective of the experiment.
Probabilistic chances of which one of the variations is expected to perform the best.

For example, if you feel that there are 80% chances of any variant being successful, you should allocate 80% audience to it, and the remaining 20% to the variation you have lesser confidence.

For the experiment:

Set the percentage division between your variations in the campaign
Remove users who uninstalled or breached the frequency capping

MoEngage out of all the active tokens the members of the control group or multivariate experiment are randomly selected. 

Randomization determines members under every variation are statistically similar to the members of the entire group and thus be exposed to the same set of conditions, except for the particular marketing campaign or campaign instance being tested.

Before Experiment

Before creating your experiment, you should:

Know your experiment objective i.e. the hypothesis you want to test; 
Understand if you want to create a control group for baseline performance
Know the segment that you would want to test this hypothesis upon
Create a number of variations (2 ^ Number of hypotheses i.e. 2 variations for testing one variable and 4 variations for testing two variables) and finalize their content

Variation 2

Define clearly the metric that you want to impact and use them in your experiment conversion goals. For example, do you just want to drive the higher open rates or want to get more conversions?
info	

TIP

 

While testing content as the variable in an A/B Testing Campaign, measure the winner by click rate, as better communication generally improves your click-through rates.

During Experiment

While creating the experiment:

Ensure that users across each split are substantial in number i.e. at least 5000 across every variation to get useful insights out of your campaigns
Use the metric to be tracked as a primary conversion goal
After Experiment

While analyzing the experiment:

Check which variation has performed best over your baseline numbers and what combination of hypotheses is represented. For example, based on the table, variation four represents two hypotheses. So if Variant 2 performs better than Variant 1, we know Hypothesis 1 is valid. If Variant 4 performs better than Variant 2, we know Hypothesis 2 holds.

Next Steps

When you identify the winning message, don't just stop there. Use this learning to create the next round of experiments. Mantra is Test. Measure. Learn. Repeat.

A/B Testing 
What is A/B or Multivariate Testing
Manual Multivariate Experiment
Experimentation is the key

In marketing and business intelligence, A/B testing is a term for randomized experiments. Controlled marketing experiments can help improve campaign success. Instead of relying on intuition, making a data-driven decision is the way forward.  

In the context of a marketing automation platform like MoEngage, experiments are campaigns on an underlying segment. Target users are chosen randomly from a segment according to percentages specified while creating a campaign. If the randomization procedure is correct, we can attribute any difference in outcomes (for example, conversion rate) between the two or multiple groups to the change we are testing without having to account for other sources of variation affecting users' behavior.

Analyzing A/B testing results

Analyzing the results of the test has been the difficult part. Most marketers are stuck with drawing a business decision out of results provided by A/B testing tools.  

Suppose you ran a test with 2 variations you observe the following click-through rates:- 

A : Impressions 50  Clicks 20  CTR 40%  

B : Impressions 50  Clicks 25  CTR 50%  

One cannot directly conclude that B is the winning variation. True underlying CTR is not known as we are trying to infer the CTR by experimenting with over a sample. The performance difference we have observed might be merely due to chance rather than because of changes we are testing.

For example, it is perfectly possible to obtain different heads/tails ratios between two fair coins if we only conduct a limited number of throws. In the same manner, it is possible for us to see a change between the A & B even though in truth the underlying user behavior is the same.

Classical Approach

To understand the results of the A/B test we generally come across terms like “significance”, “p-value” and “confidence interval”. Many A/B testing tools take this classical significance testing approach. You devise a null hypothesis that all variations are same and then by running the experiment you try to find evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Problem with classical significance testing setups :-

null hypothesis tests and p-values are hard to understand and hard to explain. There are arbitrary thresholds (0.05?) and the results are binary - you can either reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

The p-value tells how often you will see current results purely by chance. It is often misunderstood as the probability of better performance. Confidence intervals also do not directly answer 95% probability of revenue/CTR/CVR in a range.

Bayesian Testing 

To overcome these shortcomings of classical significance testing we have adopted a Bayesian framework. Instead of concentrating on mathematics and proving scientific hypothesis a bayesian setup can answer the direct questions to fasten the business decision. The analysis is easier to understand as well as to communicate to non-technical audiences. Let’s highlight some terminology that we will see in results.

Beta Distribution

In a Bayesian framework, CTR/CVR is thought of in terms of a probability distribution which represents our belief on the basis of sample size. In example above variation B has CTR 50% inferred over a sample size of 50. This is modeled using Beta distribution as shown below

95% Credible Interval

The spread of the curve represents how precisely the experiment has measured the CTR. Peak at about 0.5 (50%) represent it is the most probable value and other values on both side have some chance of being true CTR. 95% Credible interval represents range in which CTR might fall with probability 0.95.

For Variation B this is calculated as (37, 63). More wider this interval more is the uncertainty. As sample size grows this spread squeezes.

Chance of beating

It represents how likely it is that a variation beats other variation or all other variations. For our 2 variate example we again represent belief in CTR of both variations using probability distributions.

A (in Blue) : Impressions 50  Clicks 20  CTR 40%  Credible Interval: (28, 54)

B (in Orange) : Impressions 50  Clicks 25  CTR 50%  Credible Interval: (37, 63)

We can not assume that B is better. Means are quite separate apart, but there is some overlap between distributions. Credible interval above also highlights this overlap region. To quantify this uncertainty we calculate the probability of one variation beating another i.e. if you randomly draw a sample for Variation A and for Variation B, what are the chances that sample from B would have higher CTR than that of A.

Chance of B beating A  =  84 %

Chance of beating all

Suppose we have more than 2 variation 

A : Impressions 100  Clicks 15  CTR 15%  

B : Impressions 100  Clicks 20  CTR 20%  

C : Impressions 100  Clicks 25  CTR 25%

Similar to 2 variates case we can calculate:-

   Chance of A beating B & C  =  2 %

   Chance of B beating A & C  =  19 %

   Chance of C beating A & B  =  78 %

What this means for your campaigns

For campaigns with one variation and control

In campaigns where you have 1 variation along with Control Group, if the chances of Variation 1 beating control exceed 75%, it is established that your campaign communication is helpful in driving your primary conversion goal. We, hence, recommend you to remove Control Group and reach out to all users to maximize the campaign coverage and impact.

You can remove them from your running active campaigns by just editing them and setting Control Group percentage as zero. For single occurrence General Push, you can use this learning for future campaigns of similar nature.

You can see Chances to beat control in your Variation Performance table:

For campaigns with multiple variations

With multiple variations, if the chances of any variation beating all others exceeds 75%, it is established that a particular variation is performing better than all the others. We, hence, recommend you to continue only with that variation so that you can maximize campaign impact by sending the most effective message variation.

You can remove other variation from your running active campaigns by just editing and setting other variation percentage as zero. For single occurrence General Push, you can use this learning for future campaigns of similar nature. e.g. for below variation performance, we recommend you to continue with Variation 2 to maximize your campaign CTRs.

A sample campaign may look something like this:

You might have a question that though Variation 1 has high CVR but we are still recommending continuing with Variation 3? It is because we believe that a message copy contributes to increasing/decreasing your message CTR. Conversions are dependent on a lot many other factors as well. We hence consider a variation to be winning over other variations only if it has higher CTR."

A/B Testing 
What is A/B or Multivariate Testing
Dynamic Multivariate Experiment

This article builds on our first part where we introduced a Bayesian framework and arrived at an intuitive “Chance to beat” metric to analyze the results of experiments. MoEngage recommends that you read the article to understand what is Dynamic user distribution using Sherpa.

Static A/B Testing

Allocation of users is fixed at beginning of the experiment

Conventionally A/B testing has worked in a way that you create some fixed number of variations and randomly allocate some static percentage of users in them. Consider the following points in such a setup:

Some variations will perform well and some bad in terms of conversions or click-through rates. But percentages are fixed throughout the experiment and a significant number of users might receive variations that are not performing well.
It requires a manual inspection from marketers from time to time to infer which type of variations perform well and again create optimized campaigns.
Further event triggered and periodic campaigns run for a long time, in some cases for months. Such manual manipulation from time to time might not be possible.
A/B testing is meant for strict experiments where the focus is on statistical significance and hypothesis testing. Whereas we want continuous optimization where the focus is on maintaining a higher average conversion/click rate.
Multi-Arm Bandits

Introducing here a class of artificial intelligence algorithms called Multi-arm Bandits whose name is derived from slot machines in casinos. Let us first understand the analogy between A/B testing and slot machines.

You are in a casino and there are many different slot machines (bandits) each with a lever. You do not know the underlying frequency of payoffs of each of these machines. You have a limited number of chances and the goal is to maximize the rewards. How do we learn which machine gives the best payoffs? Similarly in an experiment/campaign, we have multiple variations of which best need to be learned. We have a limited sample size. Rewards are in terms of a better click/conversion rate.

Explore-Exploit

Finding the best variation or best slot machine puts us under an explore-exploit dilemma.

In Static A/B testing, you have simply hardcoded allocation to each variation initially. When you start this experiment exploration phase begins. After the manual intervention, a marketer might be able to infer which variation is performing better and recreate the campaign with optimized parameters. The new optimized campaign will be the exploitation phase. A/B testing is thus full exploration and then full exploitation. This discrete jump from exploration to exploitation is a drawback. What time should be spent in exploration and what time in exploitation? The dilemma remains!!

Bandit class of algorithms is the answer for these problems. Instead of two distinct periods of pure exploration and pure exploitation, bandit tests are adaptive and simultaneously include exploration and exploitation. Bottom line is that all the Bandit classes of algorithms are simply trying to best balance exploration (learning) with exploitation (go for based on current best information). Our implementation of the explore-exploit strategy is based on Bayesian bandits.

Bayesian Bandit Algorithms

Summarizing our first part, we introduced a Bayesian framework where CTR/CVR is thought of in terms of a probability distribution called Beta distribution which represents our belief on the basis of sample size. When we modeled each variation in our experiment using a beta distribution we arrived at the chance of beating. At a given point in time, we always know what is the probability that a particular variation is best among all other variations.

Our bandit algorithm takes this as a base and explore-exploit based on this “chance of beating”. Let’s take an example with 3 variations:-  (A, B, C)

When the experiment begins we have no information, we do not know the true underlying click-through rates. So all variations have an equal probability of winning:

A: Chance of beating all 33%

B: Chance of beating all 33%

C: Chance of beating all 33%

As the campaign progresses we will start observing impressions and clicks in each of the variations and we will recalculate the chance of beating all.

A: Impressions 100  Clicks 15  CTR 15%  Chance of beating all 3%

B: Impressions 100  Clicks 20  CTR 20%  Chance of beating all 19%

C: Impressions 100  Clicks 25  CTR 25%  Chance of beating all 78%

At this point, we continue the campaign with new percentages we have arrived at. C looks like a winner and gets 78% allocation. This is exploitation. But the rest 22% is going to A & B which is exploration. In this way, we keep recomputing Chance to beat and allocation keeps changing continuously.

Content Optimization Powered by Sherpa

MoEngage has consistently focused on building solutions that can automate and bring optimization to the delivery of campaigns. To solve the drawbacks (mentioned above) of static multivariate experiment and to maximize your campaign engagement on the go, we have launched Content Optimization - message variation with chances of highest interaction is intelligently predicted on the fly and sent to users to maximize the engagement.

When you create a multi-variate campaign, you can choose to set the distribution manually or let Sherpa (our Machine Learning associate) do it for you. Sherpa will dynamically optimize the variation distribution to maximize the campaign CTRs.

Push Campaign

Sherpa is most effective for active push campaigns but adds great value to general push campaigns as well.

info	

Campaign Duration(Throttling)

To ensure an efficient exploration, all the push campaigns created using content optimization are sent over a duration of 60 mins or the chosen throttling period, whichever is higher. For more information on throttling refer to Campaign throttling.

Email Campaign
info	

Note

A/B Testing powered by Sherpa is not available for Email campaigns in Flows.

Sherpa requires you to define the criteria metric to provide optimized campaign analytics. Choose one of the following metrics: 

Open rates - This option is best if your email template doesn’t have a lot of links and you are running experiments on your subject lines predominantly. 

Click rates - This option is more suited for templates with a lot of links and buttons and if you feel open rate might not be the best metric for your use case like if the majority of your user base is on iOS 15. 

Both open and click rates - This option is more suited for use cases than both subject line and email body experiments. Sherpa will analyze both metrics and optimize the distribution accordingly. 

info	

Campaign Duration(Throttling)

Sherpa optimized email campaigns have only two throttling time frame options two hours and four hours. This option is only available for General and Periodic Email Campaigns. 

MoEngage recommends four hours, but you can choose any one of the two options.

Analytics for Campaigns

For the campaigns created using Dynamic A/B Testing powered by Sherpa, marketers see the following additional metrics.

1. Projected CTR: Calculated as average CTR of message variations assuming users were equally split (e.g. 50:50 for two variations or 33:33:33 for three variations) across variations

warning	

Warning

Not displayed for periodic email campaigns.

 

2. Final CTR: Calculated as the ratio of total clicks and total impressions across the variations. Same as campaign CTR

3. CTR Improvement: The improvement in CTR resulted due to the usage of Sherpa-powered Content Optimization calculated as:

4. CG Uplift: CG uplift is the improvement of the conversion rates of the variants in comparison to the Control Group (Global and Campaign). CG Uplift displays the variants that influenced your conversion rates.
CG uplift is calculated as the following:
CG uplift = (Cumulative CVR of all the variants combined/ Cumulative CVR of CGs combined - 1) * 100

A sample snapshot of campaign metrics for your reference. In this campaign, Variation 2 was allocated to 82% of the users vs. only 18% for Variation 1 because of the higher CTR of Variation 2 in the exploration phase. Leveraging this opportunity, Sherpa improved your CTR from 21.21 % to 25.70 % i.e. an improvement of 21.17% or 4.5 percentage points.

*CTR is Click Through Rate

How are we doing this?

Content optimization is using Bayesian Bandit Algorithms. Bayesian Bandits brings efficiency in delivery because we move traffic towards winning variations gradually, instead of forcing you to wait for a “final answer” at the end of an experiment. This will be faster because samples that would have gone to obviously inferior variations can be assigned to potential winners. The extra data collected on the high-performing variations can help separate the “good” arms from the “best” ones more quickly. Bandit method always leaves some chance to select the poorer performing option, you give it a chance to ‘reconsider’ the option's effectiveness. It provides a working framework for swapping out low-performing options with fresh options, in a continuous process."

Why do you need a control group?
Overview

Marketers often face the dilemma of what should be communicated to customers and what is futile. They would specifically want to know, ""Is the communication that I am sending to my customers adding any value to them or my business? Will I be able to fulfill my objectives without sending that communication piece? "" Here is where marketing research experts suggest using the Control & Experiment group.

Experimental Group

An experimental group is a subset of customers we target in an experiment who receive the communication being tested.

Control Group

A control group is a subset of the customers we are targeting with a particular campaign, who do not receive the campaign. It serves as a baseline for the experiment group to compare the campaign performance. When you compare the variation with the control, you can check the campaign's impact, whether customer engagement and conversions were better or worse if the specific campaign was not sent to some customers. While no communication is being sent to the control group, MoEngage tracks the conversions for the users in this group.

The following snapshot offers a comparison between the control group and the message. We can see that by sending the notification, the marketer could increase the primary conversion goal by 126%.

So, whenever you need to communicate with customers, use a control group to establish its (f)utility. For more information on creating an experiment using MoEngage, click here. 

Include a control group in your experiment

You can enable Control Groups for the campaign during Step 1 of campaign creation. In the Control groups section, you can do the following:

Turn the Global control group toggle on to exclude the users in the global control group for the campaign.
Turn the Campaign control group toggle on to exclude the users in the control group from the campaign. As shown below, you can specify the percentage of users from the target audience to be excluded from the campaign.

Uplift in Campaigns
Overview

Uplift in campaign analytics refers to the increase in the desired metric (such as conversion rate, revenue, or customer engagement) that can be attributed to a specific campaign or action.

It is a way to measure the effectiveness or impact of a campaign by comparing the conversion goal performance for users who received your campaigns (Test group) to that of users who were not sent the message (Control Group). 

Uplift can help you in the following ways:

Analyze campaign performance (from impressions to conversions) with multiple attribution models like View-through attribution (x hours from impressions), Click attribution (x hours from clicks), and In-session attribution
Create and validate experiments using Multi-variate testing
Measure true uplift on business metric against a Control Group
Control Group Uplift

Control group uplift refers to the increase or decrease in the desired metric observed within the control group when comparing it with the target group. In campaign analytics, a control group is a group of individuals who do not receive the campaign or action being analyzed, while the target group refers to those who are exposed to the campaign. By comparing the results of both groups, you can determine the incremental impact of the campaign on the desired metric. The control group uplift helps evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign by considering the difference between the target and control groups

Global Control Group Uplift

Global control group uplift refers to the uplift observed when analyzing the results of the entire customer base or a large sample of customers who were not exposed to the campaign. In this case, the entire customer base or a significant portion of it acts as the control group, while the target group consists of customers who were targeted with the campaign. The global control group uplift provides a broader measure of the campaign's impact across a larger audience, helping to assess the overall effectiveness of the campaign.

Positive and Negative Uplift

An uplift (Control group uplift or Global control group uplift) can be positive or negative, A positive uplift indicates that the campaign or action had a positive impact and led to better results compared to not running the campaign or taking that action. On the other hand, Negative uplift indicates that the campaign or action had a negative impact and led to worse results compared to not running the campaign or taking that action.
Both positive and negative uplift provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of campaigns and help you optimize your strategies.

Calculate Uplift Percentage
To calculate the uplift percentage of the target group for a particular conversion goal, use the following formula:
Target Uplift = (Conversion rate of the target group - Conversion rate of the control group)x 100
                                                Conversion rate of the control group
To calculate the uplift percentage of a variation for a particular conversion goal, use the following formula:
Variation Uplift = (Conversion rate of variation - Conversion rate of the control group)x 100
                                             Conversion rate of the control group
Where, Conversion rate (CVR) for target group = Unique conversion of target group
                                                                                  Total impressions/delivered in the target group

Conversion rate (CVR) for the control group = Unique conversion of the control group

                                                                                      Total users in the control group

Conversion rate (CVR) for variation = Unique conversion of the variation

                                                                 Total impressions/delivered in the variation

Information

For Push campaigns,
The conversion rate (CVR) is calculated using the following formulae: 

(Unique Conversions)/ (Total Impression)
(Unique Conversions)/ (Total Clicks)
For SMS campaigns,
The conversion rate (CVR) is calculated using the following formulae:
(Unique Conversion/Total Sent)*100
If delivery is enabled, (Unique Conversion/Total Delivered)*100

FAQs: Uplift, Multivariate Testing, Dynamic Multivariate Testing

Here we have curated a few FAQs regarding Static and Dynamic Multivariate Testing

Q. What is multi-variate testing?
Ans. Multivariate testing refers to the presence of more than two variations of a communication that are sent to different users chosen at random to compare the performance of message variations.

Q. How are the users distributed across variations?
Ans. The audience is divided into two parts, and each audience receives any one variation of email.

In Manual A/B testing, you define the distribution, which remains fixed throughout the campaign. This distribution will not change unless you edit it manually. In this method, the analysis is presented at the end of the campaign, which helps to decide the better-performing variation to utilize in upcoming campaigns.
In Dynamic A/B testing, Users are equally distributed across variations at the beginning of the campaign. In this method, the distribution and analysis are continuously made based on the performance of each variation during the campaign's running time. 

Q. Is the message variation sticky in nature, e.g., if a user received Variation 1 of any periodic campaign on Day 1 and is re-eligible to receive the same campaign on any day later, will he/she receive only Variation 1?

Our A/B Testing feature is not sticky in nature. Every time, a periodic instance is scheduled to run, we fetch all the eligible users and divide them randomly across message variations. Hence the user may or may not receive the Variation 1.

Similarly, if a user becomes re-eligible to receive an already received active campaign, same scenario will be repeated.

Q. What is a Control Group?
Ans. A control group is a subset of the customers we are targeting with a particular campaign, who will not receive the campaign and will hence serve as a baseline to compare campaign performance.

Q. How do we measure campaign Uplift?
Ans. Campaign Uplift measures the impact of your message variations to drive conversion goal. Control Group performance serves as base-line to calculate the Uplift. You can check this in detail here.

Q. How can I identify the users who received a certain variation of my general push campaign?
Ans. You can find these users by making a segmentation query by navigating to MoEngage Dashboard > Segment > Create Segment. The query will be:

has executed Notification Received Android where campaign id contains <cid>_F_T_GP_AB_<VariationSerialNumber>

e.g for cid:57f112bc2b8dbc480b457ffe

Variation 1 can be identified with key: 57f112bc2b8dbc480b457ffe_F_T_GP_AB_1

Variation 2 can be identified with key: 57f112bc2b8dbc480b457ffe_F_T_GP_AB_2
Variation 3 can be identified with key: 57f112bc2b8dbc480b457ffe_F_T_GP_AB_3
 
The resultant query for Variation 1 will be: has executed Notification Received Android where campaign id contains 57f112bc2b8dbc480b457ffe_F_T_GP_AB_1
 
Note: Currently we do not allow to identify members of Control Group.
 
Q. How can I identify the users who clicked a certain variation of my general push campaign?
Ans. You can find these users by making a segmentation query by navigating to MoEngage Dashboard > Segment > Create Segment. The query will be:

has executed Notification Clicked Android where campaign id contains <cid>_F_T_GP_AB_<VariationSerialNumber>

OR 

has executed Notification Clicked iOS where campaign id contains <cid>_F_T_GP_AB_<VariationSerialNumber>

e.g for cid:57f112bc2b8dbc480b457ffe

Variation 1 can be identified with key: 57f112bc2b8dbc480b457ffe_F_T_GP_AB_1

Variation 2 can be identified with key: 57f112bc2b8dbc480b457ffe_F_T_GP_AB_2
Variation 3 can be identified with key: 57f112bc2b8dbc480b457ffe_F_T_GP_AB_3
 
The resultant query for Variation 1 will be: has executed Notification Clicked Android where campaign id contains 57f112bc2b8dbc480b457ffe_F_T_GP_AB_1
 
Q. What is our statistical approach - Frequentist or Bayesian?
Ans. We use Bayesian Testing because the results of Bayesian Testing are easily understandable for marketers plus absorb the prior learning which refines the result over time. You can read a primer on Bayesian Testing here."

What are Predictions?
Overview

MoEngage Predictions help predict the actions users are going to perform in the next few days. For example, the feature can be used for predicting users who are going to make a purchase, uninstall the app, or become dormant. This information is useful for the growth of your product or service, and you can perform necessary and required actions based on it.

Capabilities of Predictions

With MoEngage Predictions, you can: 

Predict users who are going to convert, uninstall, or become dormant. Predict a specific action - for example, predict users who are going to purchase from the category fashion, predict users who are going to uninstall from the Android platform, and so on.
Predict users who are going to perform a custom action.
Create a campaign for the predicted users with few clicks.
Out-of-the-box Predictions

MoEngage provides three out-of-the-box predictions:

Conversion Prediction - In the next 7 days, the user executes the Conversion Event
(The conversion event is taken from the general settings.)
Uninstall Prediction - In the next 7 days, the user executes Device Uninstall.
Dormancy Prediction - In the next 7 days, the user does not execute App/Site Opened.

You can also create custom predictions based on the actions a user performs.

With MoEngage prediction, you can have five live predictions at any time. You can archive an older prediction and create new predictions as well.

Sherpa, the machine learning module of MoEngage, uses all available data points and generates a propensity score of performing/not performing an action for each user. You can choose the propensity category (High, Medium, Low) and target users accordingly.

MoEngage prediction updates the propensity category for all users with a frequency of your choice.  You can then reach out to the user right before they uninstall or become dormant or do any purchase."

Sample Prediction Uses

Marketers can create the following sample use cases using MoEngage Prediction.

Predict a particular outcome or conversion goal

User conversion refers to performing a particular business objective or outcome as defined by the marketer. Using predictions,

Identify the propensity of users to perform a particular objective or goal.
Identify segments of users who have high compared to low propensity and create targeted campaigns.

For example, users with a low propensity to convert are targeted with contextual offers and discounts. The users have more timely campaigns with higher frequency than users who have a higher propensity to convert.

Churn Rate Prediction

Churn rate refers to the percentage of users who stop using the app or service in a specified time period. Businesses must focus on ensuring a higher growth rate with lower churns. With predictions, marketers can pre-empt the loss of a customer and design necessary follow-up or nurturing proactively before it is too late.

For example, users with a high propensity to churn are targeted with contextual offers and discounts. The users have more timely campaigns compared with more timely campaigns with higher frequency than users who have a higher propensity to convert.

Lifetime Value Prediction

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) refers to how much a customer is worth to the business and the average revenue generated throughout the entire span of the relationship with them. With predictive analytics, marketers can predict the future engagement with the users along with the revenue the engagement is likely to bring in.

Predict and plan marketing campaigns upfront

With predictions, marketers can clearly predict and pre-empt user actions and outcomes. Marketers create a suitable plan for the kind of campaigns required for the users. Risks are significantly reduced as decisions are made based on data, not based on assumptions that rely on instincts and some educated guesses.

The right type of content is identified for certain customers. Customize content creation and distribution based on user preference for content, channel, and time. When customers receive higher-quality communication, it increases the probability of sales conversions.

Similarly, based on the user propensity and the number of users likely to perform or not perform an action, marketers can suitably predict customer acquisition and overall retention costs needed to incur in the coming week or month and budget accordingly.

Upselling and Cross-Selling Opportunities

Predict and identify what the customer's needs and wants are. Identifying products are selling and the affinity of users towards a particular brand or product category. By predicting user propensity, marketers can target and create contextual campaigns to recommend suitable product categories to the user."

Propensity distribution

Propensity Distribution is the distribution of users in the decile buckets and also in categories of high, medium, and low with respect to the propensity.

Decile buckets (1-10%, 11-20% etc.) of propensity shows the user count in the respective propensity range. Distribution by category shows the high (propensity > 70%), mid (propensity 40-70%), and low (propensity < 30%) propensity respectively.

For example, if a user purchases an item the propensity is 70%, if a user has items in the cart then propensity is 40% and if the user has no items in the cart or has not viewed any products propensity is 10%

Correlation parameters

Correlation is the measure of the strength of the linear relationship between correlation parameters and predictions. An increase in the positive correlation parameter increases the probability of predicted action or no action. An increase in the negative correlation parameter decreases the probability of predicted action or no action.

For example, when items are added to the cart, the action is positive.

Proactive Assistant
Overview

Proactive Assistant is an AI-powered assistant that provides marketers with valuable insights to enhance their marketing efforts. MoEngage meticulously gathers comprehensive data from diverse sources, harnesses the capabilities of AI and robust algorithms to transform it into actionable insights, and presents these insights in a streamlined, unified interface.

Proactive intel at fingertips: PA does not need instructions or queries from you to run and produce insights. But proactively combs through all of the data and generates actionable insights.
One-click actionable insights: The performance-boosting insights suggested by the assistant are actionable with a few clicks. You can send out a campaign immediately or save them as segments to analyze them further
High-impact insights delivered first: The system creates plenty of insights but showcases to customers the ones most impactful to boost performance. The system uses intelligent algorithms to evaluate the impact of every insight and prioritizes them accordingly.
Unlock hidden business opportunities: PA processes a wide array of data related to users, events, campaigns, devices, etc. to mine valuable performance-boosting insights, which customers couldn’t have uncovered otherwise.
Limited intel on key segments: A marketer-driven segmentation is often elementary and helps uncover only primary segments based on predefined values of attributes. Brands often miss out on discovering more sophisticated, outcome-driven segments, which only algorithms can help recommend. Understanding and targeting these segments could be paramount to business growth.
Manual efforts to mine segments: Extracting target customer segments at present requires manual efforts. Understanding the creation of micro-segments requires configuring variables such as user and event attributes, time duration, and so on. This could be time-consuming and overwhelming for some users.

Accessing Proactive Assistant

Use one of the following:

Click on the Assistant button in the header to access the assistant.



Segment Insights

The Proactive assistant surfaces insights based on customer segments. There are two types of segment insights the assistant would be suggesting:

Segment Based on RFM: RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) Model provides auto-segmentation and bucket users into categories such as Loyal, Promising, At Risk, and so on based on user behavior. 
Auto Segmentation: Sherpa automatically generates user clusters or segments using proprietary AI. Specify any event and attribute used for generating these clusters.
RFM Insights

RFM Insights proactively provide valuable information to Marketers about the user base. Use MoEngage Sherpa AI engine to get the most important users and uncover insights about user behavior on your product. For more about RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) segments, refer to What is RFM analysis.

Engage with users belonging to the RFM segment based on the defined Recency, Frequency, and Monetary attributes. For example:

An audio streaming company would like to know which of its customers are About To Sleep and how to re-engage them.
(Recency - App Opened, Frequency - Song Played & Monetary - Subscription Price)
An online retail store might want to know which of its customers Needs Attention and how can they be nudged.
(Recency - Website Opened, Frequency - Order placed & Monetary - Price)

On the other hand, a brand would like to understand which of its customers have transformed from one RFM segment to another and what should be the strategy to engage with them.

A credit card company would like to know which of its customers have transitioned from Champions to Needs Attention, to re-engage them before losing forever quickly.
(Recency - App Opened, Frequency - Transaction Completed & Monetary - Payment amount)
An OTT platform might want to know which of its customers have transitioned from Lost to Can’t Lose Them to understand what worked and keep them further engaged. 
(Recency - App Opened, Frequency - Content Watched & Monetary - Subscription Price)
Setting up RFM insights

Navigate to Settings > Proactive Assistant > RFM Insights. Specify the events and revenue attributes you would like to use for RFM analysis. Sherpa will provide the relevant insight and alerts for any sizable movement of users across the RFM segments. 

You can set up up to 5 different RFM Metrics that will be used as input to Sherpa. By Default, Recency and Frequency Events will be set up as App/Site Opened and Monetary Event will be picked from Settings (Settings>General>Key Metrics Parameters). These inputs will be analyzed over the duration added in “Analysis Duration” (Analysis Duration is recommended to be above 7 Days for meaningful insights). 

 

Actions on Insights

Users will be able to create a custom segment or a campaign directly from an insight. Navigate to the insight that you want to use for a campaign or segment creation, and click on Actions on the bottom right.

Name the Custom Segment, save it and you will be to create a campaign with it. 

Segments created from the RFM Insights will be dynamic, which saves the RFM segment definition, not the exact users. The next time when a campaign with an RFM segment is sent, one time or periodically, that RFM segment gets calculated and the newly generated RFM segment will be used in the campaign.
Segments created from the Auto Segmentation cluster will be static, the users in the segments will be saved and will remain the same whenever it is used for analysis or a campaign.

 

Share: To share insight, navigate to the insight card on the top right and click on copy insight. 

Pause: If an insight type is not relevant to you right now, you can pause it for 30 days.

Feedback: You can also share any specific feedback that you have for any insight to MoEngage using the feedback button.

Proactive Assistant insights have a life of 60 days before they expire. 

Key Insights
Key insights provide valuable information to marketers regarding Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly Active Users (MAU). Insights for DAU and MAU are instrumental in decision-making processes related to user retention, growth analysis, market penetration, user engagement, and user segmentation.


Let's look at some examples:

A movie streaming company would like to know the monthly active user count and the reasons for the expected drop in the user count.
An e-commerce website might want to know the Daily active user count and best-performing factor in the user count growth

Examples of Key Insights:

Specify the App Open Event, Conversion Event, and revenue attributes you would like to use for Key insights. Specify the Deviation Interval and Analysis Duration based on your need.

Proactive Assistant will provide the relevant insight and alerts for any sizable movement of users for DAU and MAU Metrics.

 

Conversion Rate Insights
Insights on conversion rates furnish marketers with valuable data concerning the efficacy of their campaigns. These insights play a pivotal role in the decision-making processes of user conversion, campaign success, purchase trends, and other pertinent factors.

 

Let's look at some examples:

A fintech company would like to know the monthly transaction completion as conversion and the reasons for the expected increase in the conversion rate.
An e-commerce company in the fashion business might want to know the conversion rate on their website and the key factors in the conversion rate increase. 

 

Examples of Conversion Rate Insights:

Example 1:

 

Example 2:

 

Setting up Conversion insights

Conversion insights will be generated using the Conversion Event, and revenue attributes set in the Key Insights settings, as mentioned in the above section.

 

Retention Insights

Customer retention insights are crucial for businesses as they contribute to further growth and help stabilize profitability. These insights play a pivotal role in key decisions such as customer acquisition cost, generating opportunities for sustainable growth, and redefining the customer experience.


Retention Insights provides critical D7 and D30 insights that are indispensable for any business. At D7, users demonstrate advanced engagement with the core platform, serving as a valuable indicator for mid-term user retention. Subsequently, by D30, users transition into the highly valued category.

 

Let's look at some examples:

In an e-commerce business, what percentage of users visited a specific product on the app, returned to the app, and made a purchase?
In a lending business how many users are applying for the loan after signing up?

Examples of Retention Insights:

Timing
Best time to send

Best Time to Send (BTS) provides a prescriptive time slot to send a campaign to the user to increase the chance of interaction or user response. The following are the features of BTS:

BTS is defined within MoEngage at a user level.
Marketers send campaigns or communication to users at a time when the chances for users to respond and interact are higher.
Marketers leverage advanced intelligence and personally target each user at the most preferred time slot instead of sending a communication to all users at a fixed time.
How does it work?

BTS uses advanced data analysis to analyze historical user interactions with the campaigns and channels. The analysis is done separately for Push, Email, and SMS & RCS, and the corresponding best time is determined.

The best time value for each channel is an hourly bucket between 0-24 hours and is available for individual users.  For calculating the BTS for each channel, the following events are considered:

Push activity events: All events performed by the user
Email activity events: Opens, Clicks, Viewed in browser
SMS & RCS activity events: Clicks

For a user who does not have any activity events for the Email, SMS & RCS channels, all the events performed by the user will be used to obtain the BTS hence it will be the same as the best time value for the Push channel. Hence for some users, you may not be using Email/SMS & RCS channels, but MoEngage still calculates Email/SMS & RCS BTS, which will be the same as Push Best time.

Configure campaigns to target users at their best time

You can configure the best time option in a One time or Periodic campaign for Push, SMS & RCS, and Email channels. 

To set BTS,

Navigate to step 3 of the campaign creation flow - Schedule and goals.
Select one of the options: At specific date and time or Periodic.
Select the Best time for user.

For more information, refer to

Create Push
Create Marketing Email
Create SMS & RCS
Example

If you select the Start time as 6:58 PM and want to send a message based on the best time till 9:58 PM then this defines your BTS window. All the users in the segment whose best time lies between 7 PM and 10 PM will get the campaign at their respective best time as explained below:

Assume that there were 100 users in the segment and distributed as explained in the following table:

Total users in Segment: 100 


 

 

 

Of 100 users, the users whose BTS is available: 75




 

	

Number of users whose best time is within the BTS window (6:58 PM to 9:58 PM): 50

25 users have the best time as 7 PM

	The campaign will be sent at 7 PM


15 users have the best time as 8 PM

	The campaign will be sent at 8 PM


10 users have the best time as 9 PM

	The campaign will be sent at 9 PM



Number of users whose best time lies outside the BTS window (6:58 PM to 9:58 PM): 25

Depending on the option you choose under ""If user’s best time is outside this time window"" 

If you choose ""Send message at start time or end time"", let us assume

15 users have the best time before 7 PM

	The campaign will be sent at 6:58 PM (start time)


10 users have the best time after 10 PM

	The campaign will be sent at 9:58 PM (end time)

 

If you choose ""Do not send message"" then these 25 users will not be targeted 



Of 100 users, the users whose BTS is not available: 25

	

Depending on the option chosen under ""if user's best time is not available""

The campaign will be sent either at the campaign start time of 6:58 PM
At the app's best time. App's best time is explained in detail below
Do not send a message
Filtering users based on their best time

You can also segment the users based on their best time value. The BTS attribute is available in the User Property dropdown, under the Predictive Insights (Sherpa) section.

The Best Time to Send is calculated for each channel by:

Aggregating all specified user events in the last 60 days. MoEngage Intelligence (Sherpa) automatically aggregates the user events by day of the week and the hour within a day to determine the most active time of a user.
Weightage is given to the most recent user events and activities than the ones performed earlier. 
User best time is computed by considering both the user's intraday activity and the days on which the user was active. Also, all users who have not performed any email or SMS & RCS activity will be populated with push best time by default for the channel best time.
Period for BTS Calculation
Best Time to Send value will be generated for any user who has performed an activity in the last 60 days
BTS values are updated for all users once a week.
Apps Most Active time

The time when all users of the app are most active. App Most Active Time is captured for different channels.

Push app best hour: Hour with max no of users performing activity irrespective of the channel.
Email app best hour/ SMS & RCS app best hour: Hour with max no of users performing channel level activity, that is activity related to Email or SMS & RCS. For emails and SMS & RCS, if there is no channel-level activity in the past 60 days, the push app's best hour will be shown by default.
How are Apps Most Active Time calculated?

App Most Active Time is calculated by aggregating the hour in a day when the maximum number of users perform activities. 

Limitation

BTS is not applicable for a triggered campaign because the sending for a triggered campaign is governed by when the user performs the campaign trigger event and the delay between the trigger event and the campaign sending time, set by you.

Best Time to Send is available by default for accounts with the enterprise plan. Contact your account manager or the MoEngage Support team if you wish to enable this for your account.

To contact the MoEngage Support team, you can raise a ticket through the Support Web Form within the MoEngage dashboard. For more information, refer here.

Trigger Delay Optimization
Why do we need delay optimization?
When an Event-triggered campaign is created, we specify at what time interval after trigger criteria is fulfilled, the push should be sent. This delay period is the function of the trigger events and how the push notification in response enables your customer as a follow-up to conversion from where he left.
Hitherto, while creating an event-triggered campaign, the delay period is left to the judgment of the marketer. As they run these campaigns for a long period, delay settings remain static over time and can’t evolve as per user behavior.
 
This delay setting needs to be dynamically optimized and should evolve on the basis of performance in real-time. We, at MoEngage, via our proprietary machine-learning algorithm, will optimize trigger delay to maximize CTRs.
Create a campaign using delay optimization
To create the Event-Triggered campaign using Optimized Delay, on Step 1 of campaign creation while setting the delay, click the check-box as below.
Once checked, you need to configure the minimum and maximum admissible delays. Our algorithm will optimize the delay between these limits
For the example delays, your final settings will look something like this where 60 minutes is your baseline delay. Our algorithm will learn over the delays between 30 mins to 180 mins.
 
Analyze Campaign Impact
After the campaign has run for a certain period, you will be able to see the campaign CTR on the campaign analytics page. You can compare this CTR to that of your previous campaigns to measure the impact."

How to Update Order Status Using Inform
Introduction

Brands always want to keep their customers updated on the orders they place. These order tracking emails help build trust between businesses and customers, as they provide transparency and accountability throughout the order fulfillment process.

In this article, we will learn how to send timely updates in real time to customers about their orders. We will consider an order status update where the order has been dispatched and all products belonging to the order will also be posted with it.

Expected Result

Users receive an email with the order confirmation:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Subscription to the Inform module, which allows you to trigger 1:1 communication with APIs across multiple channels with an SLA of 5 seconds.
A backend system that allows you to make API calls to the MoEngage Inform module. Whenever the order status is changed, the MoEngage Inform API will be called with the required details.

For more information, refer to Inform and Inform API.

Define the Payload for the Inform API

The API payload must contain the order status and the details of the products purchased. The payload has a defined structure but you can customize the personalized_attributes as required.

Sample Payload
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{

	    ""alert_id"": ""65xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx98"",

	    ""transaction_id"": ""IN-00263"",

	    ""payloads"": {

	        ""EMAIL"": {

	            ""recipient"": ""john.doe@moengage.com"",

	            ""personalized_attributes"": {

	                ""customer_name"": ""John"",

	                ""items"": [{

Create an Inform Alert

In this section, let us create an Inform Alert.

Step 1: Alert Details

While you can select any channel available, let us use Email as a channel in this article. For more information on creating an Inform Alert, refer to Create Alert.

Step 2: Content

On the Drag and drop editor tab, create the template as required to display the order status and the product details.

Order Status and Other Relevant Details

The keys used to define the payload are used here as Jinja attributes: {{order_status}}, {{order_id}}, and {{estimated_delivery_date}}.

Product Details

After you configure the row with all the details, you can add the condition to reiterate through the products and display each based on the template defined.

Select the row and add the condition as displayed here where items is the key within which the array of objects is passed:

Name: Products Purchased
Description: Products Purchased
Before: {% for item in items %}
After: {% endfor %}

After adding the condition, use the keys from the Product object to personalize the values for each product where the item refers to the current iteration.

Images
Click the image content block.
Turn the Dynamic image toggle on.
Enter the JINJA attribute in the Dynamic Url field.

Step 3: Publish
Test the Alert

After the entire template is defined, you can test the email using the cURL provided in the next step with Postman.

You can test your Alert before publishing it to check if the integration with the API is working fine and to view the actual email as it will be received by your users. For more information, refer to Test Your Alert.

Publish the Alert

Click Publish at the bottom right. This will publish your alert and generate an Alert ID that will be used to uniquely identify your alert. You can also use the Reference ID that you entered to identify your alert.

Alert Go Live

If the test is inline with the expectation, you can use the same payload to configure the alerts for the API calls that would be initiated from your backend. The logic of when to call these APIs depends on the business requirements.

Conclusion

With this set-up, customers can receive timely updates as and when you trigger the alert, and can be completely automated thereby eliminating the need for manual intervention.

While the logic for triggering is in the backend, you can change the templates anytime from the MoEngage dashboard. In addition, such timely updates not only improve customer trust but also reduce support queries."

Retarget Customers Using Facebook
Introduction

When users browse through various products, compare reviews and prices, and add the selected items to their cart, marketers understand that they intend to purchase. However, many reasons prevent users from purchasing the products. Assuming they got distracted, we must nudge them to complete the purchase. Facebook ads are an effective way to retarget them.

Advantages of retargeting customers using Facebook Audience
Reaches a pre-qualified audience: Retargeting focuses on people who have previously interacted with your website, app, or Facebook page, meaning they are already familiar with your brand and potentially interested in your products or services.
Increases conversion rates: By reminding potential customers of your offerings, retargeting can nudge them towards completing a purchase or taking the desired action.
Enhances brand recall: Retargeting campaigns help keep your brand on top of users' minds, especially for those who may have left your website without making a purchase.
Cost-effective advertising: Targeting a specific audience that is already familiar with your brand can lead to higher ROI and lower advertising costs than general advertising.
Personalized ad experiences: Retargeting allows you to create dynamic ads that show users products or services they've previously viewed, enhancing the user experience and increasing engagement.
Mobile-first approach: Most Facebook users access the platform via mobile devices, making Facebook ads a natural fit for mobile-first marketing strategies.

We will achieve this use case by creating a Facebook Audience campaign to retarget your high-intent users.

Expected Result

Users who abandon their carts will be added to your Facebook Audience and removed once they complete a purchase.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user adding an item to the cart and related information such as the platform, searched product's ID, name, and price must be available in MoEngage. In this example, we will use the events Added to Cart and Payment Success. For more information on how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.

Your custom audience must be available in MoEngage. In this example, we will assume it to be Cart_Abandonment_Users_For_Fb.

Your Facebook Audiences must be integrated with MoEngage. For more information on the steps, refer here.

Add or Remove Users from Facebook Audience

Ideally, when a user adds a product to the cart, we must trigger an engagement journey with them to bring them back to the app to complete the purchase.

For example, if the user does not return to the app after 7 days, the next option is to target them using Facebook Audience.

This use case will be accomplished by following these steps:

Step 1: Add users to the Facebook Audience
Step 2: Remove users from the Facebook Audience
Step 1: Add Users to the Facebook Audience

In this section, we will add users to a Facebook Audience campaign.

Step 1.1: Target Users
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
On the All campaigns page, click + Create campaign.
Under Audience, click Facebook.

You are taken to the first step, Target users.
Define your campaign with a name and tags.
Under User qualification criteria, click Based on a trigger event. Selecting this will trigger the campaign upon the user performing a specific event.
Under Select Trigger Condition, define the condition to be users who have added the product to the cart but have not made the purchase with a delay time of 7 Days, as shown below:

Under Target users, click All Users.
Click Next to move to the second step, Audience detail, where we will define the audience.
Step 1.2: Audience Detail
Under Add or delete FB audience, click Add users to FB audience.

In the Select/create custom audience list, select the audience to which the segmented users will be added. In this example, we will select Cart_Abandonment_Users_For_Fb. For more information on creating a custom audience, refer here.
This list displays audiences for the default ad account ID configured in the Facebook Audience settings page. For more information, refer here.
In the Identifiers section, select the identifiers based on your requirements. Facebook will match the users based on the selected identifiers. For more information, refer to Match Identifiers.
Next to move to the third step, Schedule and goals, where we will define the campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 1.3: Schedule and Goals
In the Send campaign section, define when you want to start and end your campaign.
In the Conversion goals section, add conversion goals that you would like to track. For more information, refer to Create Facebook Audience Campaign.
Click Publish.

Now, your users who have abandoned their cart will be redirected to your Facebook Audience.

Step 2: Remove Users from the Facebook Audience

After purchasing the product, the user temporarily becomes low-intent. Displaying paid ads to them would be an additional cost for you. Hence, you must remove these users from the audience Cart_Abandonment_Users_For_Fb. In this section, we will remove users from a Facebook audience campaign.

Step 2.1: Target Users
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
On the All campaigns page, click + Create campaign.
Under Audience, click Facebook.

You are taken to the first step, Target users.
Define your campaign with a name and tags.
Under User qualification criteria, click Based on a trigger event. Selecting this will trigger the campaign upon the user performing a specific event.
Under Select Trigger Condition, define the condition as users who have purchased the product with a delay time of 10 minutes, as shown below:

Under Target users, click All Users.
Click Next to move to the second step, Audience detail, where we will define the audience.
Step 2.2: Audience Detail
Under Add or delete FB audience, click Delete users from FB Audience.

In the Select/create custom audience list, select the audience from where the users are to be deleted. For this example, select Cart_Abandonment_Users_For_Fb.
In the Identifiers section, select the identifiers based on your requirements. Facebook will match the users based on the selected identifiers. For more information, refer to Match Identifiers.
Click Next to move to the third step, Schedule and goals, where we will define the campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 2.3: Schedule and Goals
In the Send campaign section, define when you want to start and end your campaign.
In the Conversion goals section, add conversion goals that you would like to track. For more information, refer to Create Facebook Audience Campaign.
Click Publish.

Now, the users who have purchased a product will be removed from your Facebook Audience.

Conclusion

In this use case, we created a campaign to retarget your high-intent users through Facebook Audience. These users are more likely to engage with your paid campaigns and make purchases. After the user makes the purchase, the event Payment Success is triggered in the user's profile, increasing their LTV. Additionally, the user is then removed from the Facebook Audience."

How to Add Carousel Banners on App Home Page
Introduction

Applying carousel banners on the home page of your website is a great way to engage with your app users and promote specific offerings.

In this article, we will learn how we can use MoEngage Self-Handled Cards to build a banner carousel on your Android and iOS native apps and create Card campaigns to deliver targeted Cards to your app visitors through these banner carousels.

Expected Result

Users will see a carousel banner on the home page of your website:

Steps to Integrate

MoEngage self-handled Cards allow you to access the raw payload of the Card content. You can create components in your app to consume these payloads and display the Card content in a design and layout that works as an integrated component of your app.

The following steps will help you with the following:

Cards Integration
Cards UI Creation for each Category
Parsing MoEngage Cards Payload and Feed into the Carousel UI
Track Analytics
Step 1: Cards Integration
For Android
Installing using Catalog

Integration using a Version Catalog is the recommended way of integration; refer to the Configure Version Catalog document to configure a catalog if not done already. Once you have configured the catalog add the dependency in the app/build.gradle file as shown below:

build.gradle
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	dependencies {

	    ...

	    implementation(moengage.cardsCore)

	}

Alternatively, you can add the dependency using Artifact ID as described in Installation using Artifact ID. However, installation using Catalog ID is the recommended approach as installing using Artifact ID may lead to version mismatch if mapped incorrectly.

For more information, refer to
Self Handled Cards for Android native
.
For iOS
Install using CocoaPod

Integrate the MoEngageCards framework by adding the dependency in the podfile as shown below:

Ruby
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	pod 'MoEngageCards','~> 4.0.0'

Now run  pod install to install the framework

For more information, refer to Self Handled Cards for iOS native.

Step 2: Guide for Cards UI Creation

Now that we have integrated self-handled cards, we will next build the UI that will consume the Card payload to show cards. For example, we have used SliderView and ImageSlider for Android and iOS respectively while building this use case. These will appear in a carousel format that slides for every 3-4 seconds (configurable) on the homepage.

info	

Info

The SliderView and ImageSlider are external libraries used in this use-case only as an example and are not maintained by MoEngage. We strongly recommend using libraries that you trust and best fit your use case.

Points to be taken care of at the time of rendering the data to the UI:

The campaign-driven components of the UI should match with components existing in the cards payload eg. Title, message, action, image etc.
A user may qualify not qualify for any cards, please handle removing the carousel widget or having backup content for such cases.
For all the elements in the payload, check for exception scenarios like null values, syntax errors from the campaign, and image assets not getting fetched in time.
If you have assets that may take a longer time to load, consider adding interim UI for a seamless user experience.
Ensure the image dimensions used in campaigns should fit the image containers or the UI handles the image scaling.
Texts (Header & Message) supports emojis and html format (for formatting, color etc) so ensure to handle that using Html.format() method.
Pin to top feature is present in the ""display_control"" and it has to be handled separately at the time of rendering to the UI (please refer to the sample payload for the structure).
Illustration and Basic templates have slightly different payload structures. Please account for the null value in the image key with Basic Template
Step 3: Parsing MoEngage Cards Payload and Feed into the Carousel UI

Now that we have built a UI, we will be learning how to parse the cards payload into a structure that feeds the UI.

Cards contain multiple categories and each category consists of two types of Cards as follows:

Basic
Illustration

In this document, we will see how the Illustration Card category of the Announcement type will appear in a carousel format, how to parse the Card data that we receive from MoEngage SDK, and how we render the data in the carousel layout that we created using external libraries.

For Android

To fetch all the categories for which Cards are configured, use the getCardCategories() API.

In this example, we are using the getCardsForCategory() API to fetch the Cards that belong to Announcement Type.

Kotlin
Java
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	/*Announcement is one of the categories and this API is used to fetch the card's data that belongs to Announcement Category*/

	MoECardHelper.getCardsForCategory(context, ""Announcements"")
If the function above returns the data and not NULL, then it signifies that the Card is delivered successfully and to notify this to MoEngage SDK, you call the following API. This will help you later with analytics.
Kotlin
 
Java
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	/*To notify SDK that the Card's data are successfully fetched using the function mentioned above. */

	MoECardHelper.cardDelivered(context)

After we get the Cards data from the function above, we need to parse the data to extract the details and store it in a Model class which will be used to render into the UI as shown in the following code snippet:

Kotlin
 
Java
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	/*Card's data that is fetched based on category is given here as input and processed into CardModel.java class to store and use it later. */

	      override fun parseCardData(card: Card): CardModel {

	        var title: String

	        var description: String

	        val cardModel = CardModel()

	        cardModel.card = card

	        val container = card.template.containers[0]

	        cardModel.ctaAction = container.action

	        cardModel.container = container

	        //Getting the type of the Card Template

	        if (card.template.templateType == TemplateType.BASIC) cardModel.itemViewType =

	        Constants.CARD_BASIC else if (card.template.templateType == TemplateType.ILLUSTRATION) cardModel.itemViewType =

	        Constants.CARD_ILLUSTRATION

	        //Widget - is where the Image, Header, Body message, CTA are stored

	        // ID:0 - is Image

	        // ID:1 - is Text for Header

	        // ID:2 - is Text for Body

	        // ID:3 - is CTA button

	        for (widget in container.widgetList) {

	          cardModel.widget = widget

	          if (widget.id == 0 && widget.widgetType == WidgetType.IMAGE) {

	            //setImage

	            cardModel.imageFromUrl = widget.content

	          } else if (widget.id == 1 && widget.widgetType == WidgetType.TEXT) {

	              title = widget.content

	              cardModel.title = title

	            } else if (widget.id == 2 && widget.widgetType == WidgetType.TEXT) {

	                if (widget.content.isEmpty()) {

	                  Log.e(Logger.TAG, "" : Widget text missing will not show widget."")

	                  continue

	                }

	                description = widget.content

	                cardModel.description = description

	              } else if (widget.id == 3 && widget.widgetType == WidgetType.BUTTON) {

	                  if (!widget.content.isEmpty()) {

	                    cardModel.ctaName = widget.content

	                  }

	                }

	        }

	        val backgroundColor = Objects.requireNonNull(container.style).backgroundColor

	        if (!backgroundColor.isEmpty()) {

	          cardModel.backgroundColor = backgroundColor

	        }

	      return cardModel

	    }

These parsed values are sent to the SliderAdapter to render in the UI as shown in the following Slider Adapter class file.

After the Cards are rendered properly in the UI, you can notify the same to MoEngage by calling the APIs given in the Self-handled Cards document for Android SDK.

For iOS

To fetch all the categories for which Cards are configured, use the getCardsCategories API. To fetch all the categories for which Cards are configured, use the getCardsCategories API.

	          if(category == ""Announcements"") {

	              var mSliderData = Array<NewCardModel>()

	              var mDataForAnnouncements = Array<MoEngageCardCampaign>()

	              mDataForAnnouncements = cards

	              for cardData in mDataForAnnouncements {

	                  var cardModel = NewCardModel()

	                  cardModel = parseData(cardData: cardData)

	                  mSliderData.append(cardModel)

	              }

	              var afUrlSource = [SDWebImageSource(urlString: ""https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1432679963831-2dab49187847?w=1080"")!]

	                  if(mSliderData.count > 0){

	                      for cardData in mSliderData {

	                          if(cardData.templateType == MoEngageCardTemplateType.illustration){

	                              afUrlSource.append(SDWebImageSource(urlString: cardData.imageFromUrl ?? """")!)

	                          }

	                            }

	                  if(afUrlSource.count > 1) {

	                      afUrlSource.remove(at: 0)

	                      self.slideshow.setImageInputs(afUrlSource)

	                  } else {

	                      self.slideshow.setImageInputs(self.localSource)

	                    }

	          } else {

	                self.slideshow.setImageInputs(self.localSource)

	            }

	      }

	      let container : MoEngageCardContainer = (cardData.templateData?.containers.first)!

	      newCardModel.container = container

	      newCardModel.ctaAction = container.actions

	      if(cardData.templateData?.type == MoEngageCardTemplateType.basic) {

	          newCardModel.itemViewType = ""Basic""

	      } else {

	            newCardModel.itemViewType = ""Illustration""

	        }

	      newCardModel.templateType = cardData.templateData?.type;

	      for widgetData in container.widgets {

	          newCardModel.widget = widgetData

	              if(widgetData.id == 0 && widgetData.type == MoEngageCardWidgetType.image) {

	                  newCardModel.imageFromUrl = widgetData.content

	                      if(widgetData.content.isEmpty) {

	                          print(""Widget text missing will not show widget."")

	                          continue

	                      }

	                  newCardModel.cardDescription = widgetData.content

	                        if(!widgetData.content.isEmpty) {

	                            newCardModel.ctaAction = widgetData.actions

	                        }

	                    }

	          }

	      return newCardModel

	      }

	}

These parsed values are sent to the ImageSlider to render it in the UI.

After the Cards are rendered properly in the UI, you can notify the same to MoEngage by calling the APIs given in the Self-handled Cards document for iOS SDK.

Step 4: Track Analytics

After the Cards are rendered properly in the UI, you can use MoEngage SDKs that provide APIs to fetch the Card's data, allowing you to track the usage and analytics of the Cards. To learn more, refer to the following documents:

Track Statistics for Cards in Android
Track Statistics for Cards in iOS
Test Campaigns

Creating carousel Cards is similar to creating a Card campaign for your application. While you are creating Cards, navigate to the step Create view on your MoEngage dashboard and scroll down to the Test Card section. You can test the output of your newly created Card by selecting a custom attribute and its value for a test user.

Before Testing

Expected Result

The Test Card section enables you to view the campaign on a test device to ensure that your intended message is being conveyed in the desired way.

Recommendation for Additional Layouts

This document illustrated an example of creating carousel Cards using the Auto Image Slider in Android and Image Slideshow on Cocoapods in iOS. You can use the same method to create Cards with either Basic or Illustration template and parse the payload to build different UI layouts with different libraries.

Here are a few examples for layouts that can be used instead of carousels:

  

Sample Cards Payload

You can populate any layout by parsing the Card payload into UI elements similar to how the content was parsed for the carousel use case we saw above. Here is a sample payload for a card:

Add Additional Keys in the Card Payload

The cards standard payload consists of card campaign details, expiry details, title, message, image and action. 

If you want to add additional data in the cards payload you recieve, you can add them as part of the Primary action for the card while creating the card campaign in the for for Key-Value pairs as seen below.

These K-V pairs will be part of the Card payload under action and can be parsed to be used in the self-handled cards UI.

Placement for Different Widgets in the App

In the example above, we used the Announcement Card category to filter cards that should be added to the Carousel Widget in the home page.

If you are implementing self-handled cards in multiple sections of your app (including multiple sections in the same page), we recommend using Card Categories to differentiate between the sections. This way, you can use the function Fetch cards for Categories to fetch only the relevant cards for that section.

To set card categories, raise a support ticket.

Conclusion

In this use case, we learnt how to use MoEngage Self-Handled Cards to build a banner carousel on your Android and iOS native apps and create Card campaigns to deliver targeted Cards to your app visitors through these banner carousels.

We also learnt how you can use a combination of different layouts, Card categories, and K-V pairs to implement any type of Interactive widgets as part of your users’ journey."

Trigger Card Deletion Through Custom Connector Campaigns
Introduction

As marketers, we sometimes need to delete cards to remove irrelevant or outdated promotional content that no longer serves its purpose. We should ideally remove the card when its expiry condition is met. However, there may be scenarios where you need to delete the card for a user before its expiry, such as:

User availing the benefit: The user has already utilized the card benefits, making the card irrelevant.
User feedback: If users consistently ignore or negatively react to a specific card, deleting it can improve campaign performance.
Cleaning up clutter: Removing redundant or similar cards helps present a more streamlined experience for users, allowing us to deliver focused messaging.
Advantages of triggering card deletion
Improved user experience: Automating Card Deletion based on specific trigger conditions helps improve the user experience and ensures the relevance of campaigns.
Relevant information: Removing cards after a user has taken a specific action or when they are no longer eligible for a promotion ensures that the user interface remains clean and focused on relevant information.
Reduced resource consumption: By removing outdated cards, you can optimize system performance and save resources.
Increased efficiency: Automated card deletion streamlines campaign management and reduces manual effort.

We will achieve this use case by creating a Custom Connector campaign that automatically deletes cards based on predefined trigger conditions.

info	

Information

You can also remove the card for the specific user manually using the Delete Cards API.

Expected Result

Cards will be deleted depending on the trigger conditions.

How to Identify Change in Viewership Between Two Time Periods
Introduction

Analyzing the change in the behavior of a user is important to tailor the overall engagement strategy. While a consistent user might be communicated with the general message, a user with dropping engagement might be targeted with a message relevant to them. This same theory extends to the content providers as well; the change in viewership is really helpful to suggest each user with specific recommendations and brand tone.

In this article, we will use the Retention chart and the Behavior analysis to understand the change in time and type of content watched.

Introduction,https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/27854919242516-Identify-Reasons-for-Users-Uninstalling-the-App,"Back to all Usecases
Identify Reasons for Users Uninstalling the App
Introduction

Users might uninstall an app for various reasons, including poor user experience (UX), lack of value, excessive ads, privacy concerns, performance issues, confusing onboarding process, battery drain, storage issues, lack of updates, irrelevant campaigns, and not meeting their expectations. When a user uninstalls an app, it becomes critical for the business/brand to understand the reason for uninstallation.

Advantages of identifying reasons for users uninstalling the app
Understanding user behavior: Understanding these reasons and the touchpoints where the user uninstalls the app helps the brand gain insights into its users' behavior.
Creating relevant communication: Understanding these reasons also allows you to create more relevant communication to the mentioned reason. For more information, refer to Uninstalls.
Improving user experience: Identifying the reasons for uninstalls allows you to address specific problems, leading to a better overall user experience.
Preventing future uninstalls: By understanding the reasons for uninstalls, you can proactively address potential issues and prevent users from uninstalling the app in the first place.
Improving retention: By addressing the reasons for uninstalls, you can improve user retention and reduce churn, ultimately leading to a more engaged and loyal user base.

We will achieve this use case in three steps:

Understand the number of uninstalls
Understand the user paths
Perform the funnel analysis of uninstalls
Expected Result

You will gain an overall understanding of the touchpoints and events the user performs before the uninstall event is registered. You will have a report of the uninstall events and a visualization backtracking the events from uninstall. You will have an outcome as a funnel chart for uninstalls after a campaign is received.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Uninstall Tracking must be enabled in the settings. For more information, refer to Uninstall Tracking.
Events must be available in MoEngage to track the user action of receiving notifications. In this example, we will use the events Notification Received Android or Notification Received iOS. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
An event must be available in MoEngage to track the user's action of installing the app. In this example, we will use the event Uninstalled from device.
Step 1: Understand the Number of Uninstalls

In this section, we will understand the number of uninstalls from the Analyze section.

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Analyze, and then click Uninstalls. You can check the trend of the number of uninstalls that have occurred for a particular time frame. The analysis here is at the user and event levels. The Users tab provides a unique count of uninstalls. On the other hand, the Events tab provides the count of uninstalled events regardless of whether the uninstall is unique or duplicated. For more information, refer to Uninstall.
The Uninstalls By Time section provides granularity options for viewing the metrics. You can view daily, weekly, or monthly uninstalls for a time range and platform.
The chart obtained shows the total uninstall count for a set time.
The Uninstall By Attribute section helps you filter the uninstalls by a specific attribute. For example, set uninstalls occurring with the users' Last Known City attribute. The chart obtained shows the count of uninstalls linked to that specific attribute.


Step 2: Understand the User Paths

In this section, we will understand the user paths for uninstallation. This will help us map the events that occur before uninstallation.

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Analyze, and then click User Paths. Because we are visualizing the path to uninstall, select the user path Ending With and the attribute Uninstalled from device under Show user paths analysis.
Use the default segment option and perform the analysis for All users.
Select the User path window as 4 hours. This is the number of hours you want to track for the events occurring before the uninstall.
Select the User path steps as 5. These are the number of levels you want to track before a user performs an uninstallation. For more information, refer to User Paths.

The Chart for user paths section helps you understand the significant events and touchpoints that led to the app's uninstallation on the particular date range you selected. For more information on reading the user paths chart, refer to Understanding Chart.

Step 3: Perform the Funnel Analysis of Uninstalls

In this section, we will perform a funnel analysis of uninstalls that occurred after the user received a Push campaign.

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Analyze, and then click Funnels.
Under Steps, define the first event as Notification Received Android OR Notification Received iOS because we want to analyze the uninstalls after a Push campaign is received. Select the second event as Uninstalled from device.
For the segmentation filter, select All users.
In the Funnel Options section:
In the Funnel Type list, select Funnel - Unique Users. To learn more about the funnel types, refer to Funnels.
In the Duration field, set the duration as the Last 7 Days.
In the Funnel split list, select Step 1 and then select Campaign Name or Readable Campaign to understand the top contributors to uninstallation.
Set the Funnel window as 15 minutes. This should be short enough to attribute the uninstall to that particular campaign.


Conclusion

In this use case, we understood the number of uninstalls from Analytics, understood the user path to uninstallation, and then performed the funnel analysis of uninstallation.

An in-depth analysis of the uninstalled events and users requires a significant effort. However, after obtaining this report, we will have enough insights to plan the overall strategy and base the messaging on different cohorts."

Send Weather-Based Contextual Messages
Introduction

Weather is a universal factor influencing consumer decisions, from what they wear to where they go and what they buy. Sending weather-based contextual messages is effective because weather significantly impacts consumer behavior and purchase intent. This allows marketers to deliver more relevant and personalized messages, ultimately driving higher engagement and conversions.

As a marketer, you can automate the process of notifying users about weather updates. This helps you eliminate the need to manually send campaigns each time the weather changes.

Advantages of sending weather-based contextual messages
Increased relevance and personalization: By tailoring messages to current weather conditions, you can create a more personalized and relevant experience for consumers.
Improved campaign effectiveness: By understanding how weather influences consumer behavior, you can optimize your campaigns to resonate with consumers' needs and desires at the right time.
Enhanced customer experience: Weather-based messaging can enhance the customer experience by providing timely and relevant information, such as weather-related discounts or product recommendations.
Data-driven insights: Weather data provides real-time insights into consumer behavior and purchase intent, allowing you to make data-driven decisions and optimize your campaigns for maximum impact.
Examples of weather-based messaging:

Travel industry: Airlines can use weather targeting to promote travel to warmer destinations during cold weather or offer discounts to customers in areas experiencing inclement weather.
Retail: Retailers can promote seasonal products or weather-related items, such as umbrellas or sunscreen, based on the current weather conditions.
Food and beverage: Restaurants and beverage companies can use weather-based messaging to promote drinks or meals that are appropriate for the weather, such as hot drinks in cold weather or iced beverages in hot weather.

We can achieve this use case using the following steps:

Create a business event
Create an Email campaign
Trigger the campaign by triggering the business event
Expected Result

The user receives an email notification about the current weather in their city and gets some offers on products relevant to that weather condition.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

The Enterprise plan with the Business Events feature must be enabled for your account.
The user’s city will trigger the communication, so it must be tracked as an attribute.
Step 1: Create a Business Event

In this section, we will create a Business Event for your account, which will help create an event template to capture all the required details. We can use the MoEngage Business Event public API. After setting up the event, we can use this event format to notify whenever there are extreme weather conditions in the city. For our example, the following information is a part of the business event:

Event name: WeatherUpdate1
Attributes of the event and their data type:

City: string
Current Weather: string
Suggested tool: string

Perform the following steps: 

Write the information above in the JSON format and send it to MoEngage through Postman or any other tool you choose. Refer to this Business Events API documentation for more details.
JSON

Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{

	  ""event_name"": ""WeatherUpdate1"",

	  ""event_attributes"": [

	  {

	    ""attribute_name"": ""City"",

	    ""attribute_data_type"": ""string""

	  },

	  {

	    ""attribute_name"": ""Current Weather"",

	    ""attribute_data_type"": ""string""

	  },

	   {

	    ""attribute_name"": ""Suggested tool"",

	    ""attribute_data_type"": ""string""

	  }
Make the API call. After the event is created successfully, MoEngage will send the following response:
JSON
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{

	    ""message"": ""The business event has been created"",

	    ""_id"": ""664f9cebd52979785bcadaf4""

	}
To verify if the event was successfully added:
In the MoEngage dashboard, go to a Business Event Triggered Email campaign.
In the Select Business Event list, you can check for your event. You can see the WeatherUpdate1 event listed there.

Step 2: Create an Email Campaign

In this section, let's create weather-based alerts through business event-triggered email notifications.

Step 2.1: Target Users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Outbound, select Email > Business Event Triggered.

You are taken to the first step, Target users, of defining your campaign.

Enter the following details:

Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage.

Campaign Name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, Weather-Based Contextual Comm.

Campaign Content Type: Select Promotional/Marketing.
Subscription Categories: Select a category. For example, select Last_Hour_Discount. This will help you target only those users who have opted in to receive communication about a specific category.
User attribute with email address: Select Email (Standard).

From the Select business event list, select the WeatherUpdate1 event.

In the Target Audience section, click the User property tab.
Select the user attribute City and map it with the Business Event Attribute City. So whenever in the business event API, the value in the event attribute matches the same of the user’s city, all those matched users will receive the email communication.


The business event attributes are now available in the drop-down lists. The event attribute City can now have a dynamic value each time the business event is triggered, with the value for City automatically substituted in the segmentation query.
Click Next to move to the second step, Content, where you can define the content for your Email campaign.
Step 2.2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For our example, lets use a blank HTML template on the Custom HTML editor tab.
Add the following details:
Subject
Preview Text
Sender Name
From email address
Reply-to email address
In the Template editor section, enter the content of the email message.

The content for such communications must have the values picked from the business event’s attributes, which can be done similarly to any other personalization.
Personalize the message by including information such as the user's name. This makes the message more contextual and helps users feel more connected. To do this:
Enter “@."" The Email Personalization pop-up will be displayed.
Select the information from the business event or the user attributes.

Click Done.
Click Next to move to the third step, Schedule and goals, where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 2.3: Schedule and Goals
Define when to start and end this campaign and the conversion goal based on your requirements.
Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create Email Campaigns.
Click Publish.

Step 3: Trigger Campaign by Triggering Business Events

We are now ready to start triggering the communications. When there is a weather update for the city, the campaign can be initiated using the Trigger Business Event trigger. Based on your business requirements, you can decide when to pass this event to MoEngage.

Here is a payload example:

JSON
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{

	      ""event_name"": ""WeatherUpdate1"",

	      ""event_attributes"": {

	          ""City"": [""Bengaluru"", ""NewDelhi"", ""Kolkata""],

	          ""Current Weather"": ""Rainy"",

	          ""Suggested tool"": ""Raincoat""

	      },

	       ""triggered_by"": ""john.joe@example.com""

	}
Conclusion

In this use case, we created weather updates through email notifications. We used business events in MoEngage to achieve this. The logic for triggering this event lies on your side. For instance, whenever there is a weather update for the city, they can create a business event for it, which will be used to trigger the campaign."

Alert About Drop in Stock Price Using Business Events
Introduction

Businesses want to alert their users (investors) about a drop in the price of their favorite stock because they can react differently to price drops. Some investors may view them as opportunities to buy more stocks, believing they are now undervalued. For some investors, price drops may trigger fear, leading to panic selling to avoid further losses.

Advantages of setting stock price drop alerts
Market awareness: Inform users about sudden price fluctuations in the market, which can be triggered by news events, company announcements, or broader economic factors.
Risk management: Send timely notifications to potentially limit losses if a stock price falls significantly due to negative news or unexpected events.
Potential buying opportunities: A drop in price could indicate a temporary dip that might be a good time to buy more shares of a company you believe in.
Quick reaction: A price drop alert gives them the opportunity to react quickly by either selling the stock, researching the reason for the drop, or potentially buying more shares.

We will achieve this use case in two steps:

Create a business event
Create a Push campaign
Expected Result

Users will receive a push notification about a drop in the price of their favorite stock, as shown below:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

You must have an enterprise plan with the Business Events feature enabled for your account.
Events to track the customer's interest in a particular stock must be available in MoEngage. In this example, we will name the event Stock Viewed. When a customer checks a stock’s details, an event can be triggered with the name or the ID of the stock. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
The Push channel must be configured.
Step 1: Create a Business Event

In this section, we will create a Business Event for your account, which will help create an event template to capture all the required details. We can use the MoEngage Business Event public API. For our example, the following information is a part of the business event:

Event name: Stock Price Drop Alert
Attributes of the event and their data type:
Stock ID: string
Percentage Drop: string
Current Stock Price: float

Perform the following steps:

Write the information above in the JSON format and send it to MoEngage through Postman.

In the Select business event list, you can see the Stock Price Drop Alert event.

Step 2: Create a Push Campaign

In this section, we will create price drop alerts for your users' favorite stocks through business event-triggered push notifications.

Step 2.1: Target Users
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
On the All campaigns page, click + Create campaign.
Under Outbound, click Push > Business Event Triggered.

You are taken to the first step, Target users, of defining your campaign.
Define your campaign with a name and tags. Enter the following details:

Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, Stock Price Drop Alert.
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

In the Select business event list, select the Stock Price Drop Alert event.

In the Target audience section, define the logic to identify all the customers who have viewed the stock with the same Stock ID. So, for this example, the target audience can be as shown below:



The business event attributes are now available in the drop-down lists. The event attribute’s Stock ID can now have a dynamic value every time the business event is triggered, and the value against the business event attribute Stock ID is automatically substituted in the segmentation query.

In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step, Content, where you can define the content for your Push campaign.
Step 2.2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For example, select Basic notification.

Enter the required content for the campaign. We can manually enter a title, message, and summary or generate it using Merlin AI. For more information, refer to Generate Push Messages with Merlin AI.



The content for such communications would need to have the values picked from the business event’s attributes, which can be done similarly to any other personalization.

Add personalization to the message using information such as the user's name. Such personalization makes the message more contextual and makes the users feel connected. To do the same:
Type @.
On the Push Personalization dialog box, find relevant attributes from a user's business event or user property.


Use the deep link option to direct users to a page in your app or website where they can check their ticket details.

In the Default click action list, select Deeplinking.

In the URL field, mention the relevant URL.

Click Next to move to the third step, Schedule and goals, where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.

Step 2.3: Schedule and Goals
Define when to start and end this campaign and the conversion goal based on your requirements.
Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create Push Campaigns.

Click Publish.
Step 3: Trigger Campaign by Triggering the Business Event

We are now ready to start triggering the communications. When a stock price drop is detected, the campaign can be triggered using the Trigger Business Event API. The logic of when to pass this event to MoEngage lies at your end based on the business requirement.

Create a Price Drop Campaign Using Business Events
Introduction

Businesses send price drop alerts to notify customers when the price of a product they've shown interest in has decreased. This encourages them to make a purchase by highlighting a potential deal and reminding them about the item, especially if they previously added it to their cart or wishlist but didn't buy it.

Advantages of sending price drop alerts
Re-engage potential buyers: If a customer viewed a product but didn't purchase, a price drop alert can remind them about it and incentivize them to buy now that the price is lower.
Boost sales conversion: Notifying customers of a price reduction can encourage them to complete a purchase they were previously hesitant about due to price. This helps increase sales by capitalizing on high-intent customers' desire to get the best price possible.
Improve customer experience: Providing price drop alerts shows customers that you are looking out for their best interests and are willing to help them find the best deals.
Reduce abandoned cart rates: For items left in a shopping cart, a price drop alert can prompt customers to finalize their purchase.
Create urgency: Highlighting a limited-time price reduction can encourage customers to buy sooner.

We will achieve this use case in three steps:

Create a business event
Create a Push campaign
Trigger the campaign by triggering the business event
Expected Result

Users receive a push notification on their phones for products that they have added to the cart but have not purchased and whose prices have been reduced:

Send Notifications for a New Episode
Introduction

Notifications for a new TV show episode can prompt users who are subscribed or interested to immediately access the fresh content as soon as it becomes available. As marketers, we need not manually send a campaign to the target audience every time a new episode is released. We can leverage business events to notify viewers about new episodes of their favorite series in real time.

Advantages of sending notifications for a new episode
Increased engagement: Notifications remind users to return to the platform and watch the new episode, boosting engagement and viewership.
Content discovery: Notifications can highlight new episodes that users might not have otherwise discovered, leading to more content consumption.
User retention: By keeping users informed about new content, you can improve user retention and encourage them to stay subscribed.
Personalized experience: You can tailor notifications based on user preferences and viewing history, ensuring users receive relevant updates.
Convenience: Notifications inform users about new episodes without constantly checking the platform.

We will achieve this use case in four steps:

Set up Postman
Create a business event
Create a Push campaign
Trigger the alert for a new episode
Expected Result

Users will receive a push notification about a new episode being available. The following image shows a push notification for the new episode, The One with Joey’s Fridge, for the popular TV show Friends.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

You must have the Postman software to trigger API calls to MoEngage servers. We will use MoEngage Business Events API to send the alert.
You must have an enterprise plan with the Business Events feature enabled for your account.
Events to track the customer's interest in a particular episode must be available in MoEngage. In this example, we will name the event Watched Episode. When a customer checks an episode's details, an event can be triggered with the name or the ID of the episode. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
The Push channel must be configured.
Step 1: Set Up Postman

Postman is used here for demonstration purposes. Ideally, your engineering team should integrate these APIs with the content management system you have, and they can trigger these APIs from their backend servers.

If you don’t have Postman installed yet, kindly download it and sign in using your email address. MoEngage documents all the APIs in a publicly downloadable collection here: https://www.postman.com/moengage-dev/workspace/api-docs/overview
After you open this page in the browser, export the Business Events API collection from MoEngage space and import it into your workspace in Postman.


We will now add a new business event to the MoEngage account.

Step 2: Create a Business Event

You must inform MoEngage what this business event contains so that you can use it while configuring the campaign content. Business events for an episode would typically have the episode's name, number, image, and so on. We will send this information to MoEngage using the Create Business Event API. It broadly needs the event name, attributes, and who created it.

We will name the event as ENT_New_Content_Released. We will have example@moengage.com as the email address that created this event. We will add the following event attributes to the business event with their data types.

Event name: ENT_New_Content_Released
Attributes of the event and their data type:
Name of the Series: string
Episode Name: string
Episode Number: integer
Episode Image: string
Episode URL: string (This can be used to direct the user to the content instead of having them search for it.)

Perform the following steps:

Write the information above in the JSON format and send it to MoEngage through Postman:

JSON
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	 

	{

	  ""event_name"": ""ENT_New_Content_Released"",

	  ""event_attributes"": [

	    {

	      ""attribute_name"": ""name of the series"",

	      ""attribute_data_type"": ""string""

	    },

	    {

	      ""attribute_name"": ""episode name"",

	      ""attribute_data_type"": ""string""

	    },

	    {

	      ""attribute_name"": ""episode number"",

	      ""attribute_data_type"": ""int""

	    },

	    {

	      ""attribute_name"": ""episode image"",

	      ""attribute_data_type"": ""string""

	    },

	    {

	      ""attribute_name"": ""episode url"",

	      ""attribute_data_type"": ""string""

	    }

	  ],

	  ""created_by"": ""example@moengage.com""

	}

 

Use the information above in the JSON format and make the API call with authorization information for the right data center to which your workspace belongs. For more information, refer to Create Business Event API.
After the API call is made and the event is created successfully, MoEngage sends the following response:

JSON
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{

	""message"": ""The business event has been created"",

	""_id"": ""{{Business Event ID}}""

	}
To verify if adding a business event has succeeded:
In the MoEngage dashboard, go to any Business Event Triggered campaign.
In the Select business event list, you can check for your event. You can see the ENT-New_Content_Released event.

Step 3: Create a Push Campaign

In this section, we will create a push notification campaign using these details to personalize the campaign.

Step 3.1: Target Users
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
On the All campaigns page, click + Create campaign.
Under Outbound, click Push > Business Event Triggered.

You are taken to the first step, Target users, of defining your campaign.
Define your campaign with a name and tags. Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage.
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, Episode Notifications.
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

In the Select business event list, select the ENT_New_Content_Released event.

In the Target audience section, define the logic to identify all the customers who have watched the series episode in the last 3 days. So, for this example, the target audience can be as shown below:

In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step, Content, where you can define the content for your Push campaign.
Step 3.2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For our example, select Basic notification.

Enter the required content for the campaign. We can manually enter a title, message, and summary or generate it using Merlin AI. For more information, refer to Generate Push Messages with Merlin AI.



The content for such communications would need to have the values picked from the business event’s attributes, which can be done similarly to any other personalization.

Add personalization to the message using information such as the user's name. Such personalization makes the message more contextual and makes the users feel connected. To do the same:
Type @.
On the Push Personalization dialog box, find relevant attributes from a user's business event or user property.

Use the deep link option to direct users to a page in your App or website where they can check their ticket details.

In the Default click action list, select Deeplinking.
In the URL field, mention the relevant URL.
Click Next to move to the third step, Schedule and goals, where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 3.3: Schedule and Goals
Define when to start and end this campaign and the conversion goal based on your requirements.
Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create Push Campaigns.

Click Publish.
Step 4: Trigger the Alert for a New Episode

For the demonstration, we will trigger this API through Postman. Still, for all practical purposes, you must ideally trigger this event when a new episode is added to your content management system.

To trigger the alert, we will use another business event API, trigger API. For this API, we have to pass the actual values of the new episode, which will be sent as part of the push notification. We must use the same data types we used while creating the business event.

We will use the following payload to trigger the campaign:

JSON

How to Set Up Purchase Confirmation Emails
Introduction

Purchase confirmation emails are among the most common emails sent to customers when they complete a purchase. As marketers, we need to effectively set up purchase confirmation emails—a crucial part of your customer's journey.

In this article, we will understand how to capture purchase data to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for your customers. We will create an Email campaign to send purchase confirmation alerts to your users.

Expected Result

Whenever a user completes a purchase, the user shall receive a Purchase confirmation email which is completely automated thereby eliminating the need for any manual intervention.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events which contain the details of the products purchased by the customer must be captured in an array format, not as individual events.

For example, let us consider the event ""Order Placed"". As seen in the following screenshot, the customer has purchased four products. The product’s data is captured in the following fields: Variation Title, Product Title, Image URL, Product Price, Vendor name, and so on.

Note the exact spellings of your event attributes' names because it will differ from the following example:

Create an Email Campaign

In this section, let us set up transactional emails.

Step 1: Target Users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Outbound, select Email > Event Triggered.

You are taken to the first step ""Target users"" of defining your campaign
Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For example, select ""Demo Account - E-commerce"". For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage.
Campaign Name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, ""Purchase Confirmation"".
Campaign Content Type: Select Transactional.
User attribute with email address: Select ""Email (Standard)"".

In the Select condition section, select the event that contains the purchase details as the trigger.
In the Target Audience section, select All users.
Click Next to move to the second step ""Content"" where you can define the content that will go into your Email campaign.
Step 2: Content
Select the template that you like to go with. For our example, let us select the Blank Template on the Drag and drop editor tab.
Add the following details:
Subject
Preview Text
Sender Name
From email address
Reply-to email address
In the Template editor section, enter the content of the email message.
Personalize the message by including information such as the user's name. This makes the message more contextual and helps users feel more connected. To do this, enter “@”. The Push Personalization pop-up will be displayed, allowing you to select information from the event or user's properties.

Configure the following details:
Set Up the Template


After you create the Layout, as seen in the following image, select the row where the product details must be displayed and click Add condition.





Define the Logic


In the condition block, define the logic of iterating through the arrays and displaying the required details; the logic will ensure to display all products in the array.

 

In this logic, assign a variable to each array first and then loop through each array and assign the value in each loop to another variable.

Sample Code Before
Code
	{# Assigning a variable to the array #}

	{% set imageURLlist = EventAttribute['Product Image Url'] %}

	{% set titlelist = EventAttribute['Product Title'] %}

	{% set vendorlist = EventAttribute['Product Vendor'] %}

	{% set produrllist = EventAttribute['Product Url'] %}

	{% set pricelist = EventAttribute['Product Price'] %}

	{% set varidlist = EventAttribute['Variant ID'] %}

	{# Looping through the array and assigning a variable to each value in the array #}

	{% for i in titlelist %}

	{% set imageURL = imageURLlist[loop.index-1] %}

	{% set title = titlelist[loop.index-1] %}

	{% set vendor = vendorlist[loop.index-1] %}

	{% set produrl = produrllist[loop.index-1] %}

	{% set price = pricelist[loop.index-1] %}

	{% set varid = varidlist[loop.index-1] %}
Sample Code After
Code
	{% endfor %}

Now the code should look similar to how it is shown the following image:







In the previous code, we are considering six different event attributes; the number of attributes to be displayed is based on the client’s requirement.

In the first section of Assigning a variable to the array, assign a new variable to the required event attribute array to use a new attribute.
In the section on Looping through the array and assigning a variable to each value in the array, assign a variable to the value from the array utilizing the variables used in the previous section.
These variables can then be used to call for the values in the email body.


In this case, we have used the title, vendor, price, and varied attributes.

info	

Information




For any numerical arrays, the check for whether the field is iterable must be applied, as done for the price attribute in the previous image. This is because personalisation returns a single value array of numerical as a numerical value, not string.

 

In the absence of the previous check, there will be a personalisation error whenever the user buys only one product.

Configure Images
Click the image content block.
Turn the Dynamic image toggle on.
In the Dynamic Url field, enter the JINJA attribute.

Configure the Redirection URL
Select the text.
Click the Link option from the text formatting options box that pops up.
Enter the JINJA attribute.

warning	

Warning




While you send the data to MoEngage, ensure that the index in arrays for each product is maintained. That means, the details of Product 1 must be passed at Index 0 in all arrays, the details of for Product 2 must be passed at Index 1 in all arrays.

 

In case of any mismatch, the products may have wrong information mapped.

 

Click Next to move to the third step ""Schedule and goals"" where you can define the schedule and goal of your campaign.
Step 3: Schedule and Goals
Define when to start and end this campaign and the conversion goal based on your requirements.
Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create Email Campaigns.
Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we understood how to capture purchase data to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for your customers. We created an Email campaign to send purchase confirmation alerts to your users.

After the campaign is live, you can track its performance from the campaign analytics and info page."

Add a Countdown Timer to Emails
Introduction

As marketers, we use lightning deals, midnight deals, flash sales, product launches, event registrations, membership renewals, limited-time deals, and other time-bound offers to increase website or app traffic. Such campaigns often use countdown timers, which show how long they have to take action, to catch users' attention and create a fear of missing out (FOMO) emotion to nudge them towards purchasing.

Advantages of adding countdown timers in Email campaigns
Boosting conversions: The visible ticking clock prompts immediate action, making subscribers more likely to purchase during a limited-time offer.
Increasing website or app traffic: A countdown timer's visual element grabs attention and encourages interaction with the email.
Highlighting time-sensitive offers: Perfect for flash sales, limited edition products, or upcoming events with a crucial deadline.
Creating scarcity: The perception of limited availability due to the countdown can motivate people to act faster.
Improving click-through rates: Countdown timers often lead to higher click-through rates on Email campaigns.

We can achieve this use case using the following steps:

Create a Countdown Timer
Generate HTML Code for the Timer
Embed HTML in Your MoEngage Email Template
Expected Result

Users receive emails containing a countdown timer as shown below:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

You must have a website that helps you generate the HTML code for the timer. We will use that code in MoEngage's email template.
In this use case, we will use a third-party site, countdownmail.com, to create the countdown timer.
Step 1: Create a Countdown Timer
Log in to the CountdownMail website.
Click Create a Timer in the upper-right corner to create the timer.
Customize the timer by defining labels, colors, font size, background images, and links.
Click Save Timer at the lower-right corner.
Step 2: Generate HTML Code for the Timer

Information

You can integrate HTML code from external sources to add a countdown timer to your emails. Enabling custom HTML code for the timer requires Javascript. Unfortunately, email platforms do not support Javascript due to security reasons.

On the CountdownMail website, generate the HTML code for the created timer by clicking the </> Get Embed Code at the lower-right corner of the screen.
The following embedding options are available: 
Align: You can align the timer to the page's left, right, or center.
Size: You can choose whether your timer should be fixed or responsive to the screen size.
For Retina display: Some campaigns might be targeted for retina display screens. Turn this toggle on to adjust the max width.
Enable HTTPS: This option is required if the timer is displayed on a page that uses SSL.
Click Copy to copy the embed code.
Add the copied code to your email in MoEngage as described in Step 3: Embed HTML in Your MoEngage Email Template.

Step 3: Embed HTML in Your MoEngage Email Template

In this section, we will create an Email campaign and embed the HTML code into an email template.

Step 3.1: Target Users

How to Add Calendar Invites to Emails
Overview

Marketers promote events, sales, and webinars by emailing users. Adding calendar invites to such emails would help users add the event to their calendars, increasing the campaign's effectiveness.

When you send an invite using a calendar app, it gets added to the recipient's calendar directly. However, when you send a bulk communication, as in the case of a campaign, the invites do not get added to the users' calendars directly. Thus, adding an option to add the invite to the user's calendar is beneficial. You can create calendar links or use an ICS file to send a calendar invite.

Calendar Link
ICS File
Creating a Calendar Invite

You can create calendar invites using the following and add them to the email template in MoEngage:

creating a calendar link
creating an invite using a .ics file

We recommend using both methods and adding the invite to the email, as some calendar apps do not support calendar links. Here is a list of the calendar types that support calendar links and ics files.

Calendar Type	ICS Calendar File	Calendar Link
AOL	✓	X
Apple Calendar	✓	X
Google Calendar	✓	✓
Office 365	✓	✓


Outlook

	✓	X


Outlook.com

	✓	✓


Yahoo

Creating a Calendar Link Invite
Creating a .ICS file

 

The steps to create a link invite using the Google Calendar app are described below.

Prerequisites
The invite should be created on a public calendar. For more information, refer to Create a public calendar.
Steps to create a link invite

Navigate to the Calendar app.
Click +Create in the top left corner.
Choose Event from the dropdown.
After specifying the date, time, frequency, links, description, and notes, click Save.
The event is now saved in your calendar. Click on the saved event in your calendar.
Click Edit event.
In the More actions dropdown, click Publish event. This will take you to the publish event screen, where the HTML code for adding the invite to the event will be displayed.
Copy and add the HTML code to your campaign, as described below.

Alternatively, you can create links for various calendar apps, such as Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Office 365, and Yahoo! Calendar using various online tools (such as Labnol).

Add Link to Email Campaign
Create an email campaign with the desired campaign name, target audience, and control group.
In the second step, where the email template is defined, add the link to the calendar invite as described below for the drag-and-drop editor:
Add an icon for the invite link to the email template. In our example, the icon is named ADD TO CALENDAR. For more information, refer to Adding Icons to the Email Template.
Click on the icon, and in the content pane to the right of the Drag and Drop editor, click on the More Options toggle for the icon.
In the Link Type section, paste the copied link from the publish calendar screen in the Link URL section, as shown below.
In Step 3 of the campaign creation, add the information about the campaign's delivery schedule and configure the delivery controls.
Publish the campaign.
A preview of the invite received by the user in their inbox is shown at the begining of the article.

Now that you've created a calendar invite and sent a campaign with it, head to Email Analytics and Info to see how your campaign is performing."

How to Use Gamification to Engage the Users
Overview

After acquiring the user, the next step is to retain them. To retain the users, it is imperative to create engagement hooks that drive them to keep using the brand’s app and eventually convert. This is where gamification templates such as ""Spin the Wheel"" play a vital role to provide:

Enhanced user experience
Improved engagement metrics
Uplift in conversion

In this article, we will use Flows and gamification templates to create an end-to-end engagement journey for the user.

Expected Result

Users will see an option to spin the wheel and win something.

	
Create a Flow

In this section, let us create a flow.

Add Flow Details
Navigate to Engage > Flows and click + Create Flow or navigate to the sidebar, click + Create new, and then click Flow.
Click + Start with a blank canvas to start building your flow for the use case. You are taken to the first step “Details and goals”.
Enter the following details:

Flow name: Enter a flow name. For example, ""Gamification Flow"".
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user by mentioning the trigger conditions.
Under Users enter the flow section, select On event trigger.

In the IF user section, select the event “App Update”, which gets triggered when a user updates the app.

In the THEN enter the user section, select the Immediately option.

In the Flow schedule section, define a start time and an end time to the flow if required. By default, the flow will start “As soon as possible” and will never end.

Turn the Limit user entry into this flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow.
Defining such limits helps us control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience. 

Click Next to move to the third step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you select the target audience for your Flow.

In the Audience section, select All users. For a user to be eligible to enter an event-triggered flow, they must be part of the target audience before they do the required event.
Click Next to move to the canvas section where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to move through.
Define Flow Structure

In this section, let us create a multi-step journey to engage the users. The following is only an example and can be modified depending on your requirement.

Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed.
Under Actions, select In-app.

Select an In-app template type. For example, Fullscreen - Spin The Wheel.

Modify the readymade HTML code and add conversion details.


You can modify the HTML code to rename the actions on the wheel, change look and feel, and add more actions on the wheel.
After the gamification In-app is done, depending upon the user action, cascade the flow.

For example, if the user has clicked the In-app or not. If not, send the user a nudge by a Push campaign. If the click has happened, check for the conversion goal event and further send campaigns through different channels to nudge, spin the wheel, and convert.

After the flow is ready with all the communications added for all channels, click Publish to make the flow live.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a multi-step and multi-channel journey to engage the users by adding a gamification campaign. We used Flows and gamification templates to create an end-to-end engagement journey for the user."

How to Nudge Users to Renew Their Subscription
Introduction

A Subscription Renewal Journey aims to nudge users to renew their subscription when their current subscription is almost over. Planning the same is important for the following reasons:

It is usually more cost-effective to retain the existing users than to acquire new ones, and making users renew the subscription is the best way of holding on to them. This also helps you to increase your revenue.
Moreover, this process will help us get better feedback from users when you see less motivation to renew. This will help us solve issues and thus finally help us provide a better customer experience.

A golden rule to follow while nudging users to renew is to focus on highlighting the value proposition and the benefits that they would lose if they do not renew. Also, making sure to choose the right channel and sending the message at the right time takes the impact a long way.

In this article, we will create a Flow campaign to nudge users to renew their subscription. We will use the Conditional Split and Next Best Action features in Flows to achieve this use case. We will learn how to configure multiple nudges (before 10 days, 6 days, and 1 day) before the expiry of the subscription date.

Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phone to renew their subscription:




Users receive an Email message to renew their subscription:

Enter the following details:

Flow Name: Enter a flow name. For example, ""Subscription Renewal"".
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Under the Conversion goal section, turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by doing the event “Subscription Successful”. This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user completes the payment successfully to renew the subscription. 
Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user inside the flow. 
Under Users enter the flow, select the At Fixed Time card. 
Under Periodic, select Daily and then mention the start date and the send time.
Turn the Limit user entry into the flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow. Defining such limits helps you control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience.
Click Next to move to the third step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you will select the target audience for your Flow.
Under Audience, select User property and define users who have their ""ENT- Subscription Renew Date"" user property coming up in the next 10 days. 
Click Next to move to the canvas section where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to move through.
Define Flow Structure
Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed.
Under Conditions, add the entry condition as “Conditional Split” to split users based on the number of days they have to renew. 
Add a Next Best Action (NBA) stage in the first two branches and a channel of your choice in the third branch to send a message reminding users what will they miss if they do not renew their subscription. The tone of the message can be of urgency and insisting in branch 1 whereas the tone can be of creating FOMO for users in branch 2. However, we can have a neutral tone for the Others branch because there are a good number of days left. For more information, refer to Next Best Action in Flows.

info	

Information




The Next Best Action option under Action is available only in the Enterprise plan and it is an add-on for other plans.

It is important to note that adding an NBA will help us reach out to each user in the right channel at the right time. This will help us increase the chance of higher engagement which in turn will help us to improve conversion. 
To define your Next Best Action stage, hover your mouse on the same and click on the edit icon. The Next best action pop-up is displayed.

From the Choose a fallback channel drop-down list, select a channel. A fallback channel is used when MoEngage does not have enough data to predict what is the preferred channel for a user.
In the Default time to send section, select an option. The default time is used when MoEngage does not have enough data to predict what is the best time to send the communication to a user.
Click Done.
Define the message in each of the channels (Push, Email, and SMS) that you would like to use.
Additionally, if you have information about the user such as their name and gender, use the same to personalize the message while editing your Action campaign. Also including the details about the previously purchased plan using the attribute “ENT- Subscription Category” will make the message more contextual and thereby increasing the chance of making the user feel connected. For more information, refer to Personalization in Flows.
While defining a Push notification, use the deep linking option to add a URL that takes your users to the exact page from where they can complete the purchase. This reduces the chance of drop-off and helps the user focus on what we would like them to do directly. 
After the NBA stage above or the Action stage based on the channel, you can have a ""Has done event"" stage to check if users have completed renewal by looking for the event ""Subscription Successful"". Set Keep evaluating for the next as 1 day to wait at the maximum before moving your users who have not renewed yet. 
Make sure to have some gap between any two communication to avoid spamming the user by using a Wait Stage. For more information, refer to Add Controls to Flow.
Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we create a Flow campaign to nudge users to renew their subscription.

Now that we have published the Flow, we can analyze how well our Flow is performing.
We can understand how many users entered the flow because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “User Entered Flow” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Users who have entered/exited the Flow.
We can also understand how many users actually renewed their subscription because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “Flow Trip Conversion” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Conversion Tracking and Attribution in Flows."

How to Reduce Loan Application Abandonment
Introduction

Are you a marketer looking to reduce loan application abandonment and improve your conversion rates? You have come to the right place. As a marketer, reducing loan application abandonment must be a top priority because it helps in improved customer satisfaction and revenue potential. It also helps in being cost-efficient because making users take long term loans will retain them and there by help us gain more from the invested customer acquisition cost.

Generally, loan applications have two stages: filling personal information and uploading relevant documents. In this article, we will create a Flow campaign to nudge users to complete their loan application process, depending on the stage they dropped off.

Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phone to complete their loan application:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user starting the loan application process and related information such as the platform. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide. In this example, we will name the event as “BFSI-applicationFormStarted”

Events to track the action of a user completing different parts of the loan application process such as filling in their personal information, uploading documents, and related information such as the platform, user ID, lead ID, and app version. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide. In this example, we will name the event as follows:
BFSI-LoanapplicationPersonalDetailsFilled
BFSI_LoanDocumentsUploaded
Events to track the action of a user submitting their loan application, and related information such as the platform, loan amount, tenure, customer ID, app version. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide. In this example, we will name the event “BFSI-applicationFormSubmitted”
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Create a Flow

In this section, let us create a Flow to nudge your customers to complete their loan application process:

Add Flow Details
Navigate to Engage > Flows and click + Create Flow or navigate to the sidebar, click + Create new, and then click Flow.
Click + Start with a blank canvas to start building your flow for the use case. You are taken to the first step “Details and goals”.
Enter the following details:

Flow name: Enter a flow name. For example, ""Loan Application Abandonment"".
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Under the Conversion goal section, turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by doing the event “BFSI-applicationFormSubmitted”. This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user submits the form.

Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user by mentioning the trigger conditions. For our example, the event can be “BFSI-applicationFormStarted”.
Under Users enter the flow section, select On event trigger.

In the IF user section, select the event “BFSI-applicationFormStarted”, which gets triggered when a user starts their application process. 

 

 

In the THEN enter the user section, select the Immediately option.

In the Flow schedule section, define a start time and an end time to the flow if required. By default, the flow will start “As soon as possible” and will never end.

Turn the Limit user entry into this flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow.
Note that the users are highly likely to match the Loan Application Abandonment flow’s entry rules more often and thus might enter the flow too many times. Defining such limits helps us control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience. 

 

 

Click Next to move to the third step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you select the target audience for your Flow.

In the Audience section, select All users. For a user to be eligible to enter an event-triggered flow, they must be part of the target audience before they do the required event. 

 

 

Click Next to move to the canvas section where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to move through.
Define Flow Structure
Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed.
Under Conditions, add the entry condition as “Conditional Split”. 
Define the possible movement of your users down the steps of Loan Application Completion process by starting with: 

Branch 1 checking for the “BFSI-LoanApplicationFormsubmitted” event 
Branch 2 having the “BFSI-LoanDocumentsUploaded” event 
Branch 3 having the “BFSI-LoanApplicationPersonalDetailsFilled” event
Note that the reason to have the checks in the reverse order is because of the ranking each branch of a conditional split has. For more information, refer to to Branching of Users via Condition Stages. 
Turn the Keep evaluating for the next toggle on to define the maximum time to wait for the user to execute the event. For our use case, enter 30 mins. 
Add corresponding communications to each branch of the conditional split to acknowledge their loan application being successfully completed by suggesting their next course of action or nudge them to move to the next step in the process based on their current stage.
For example, a user moving down branch 3 has completed personal information but did not share their documents for approval. So the communications in branch 3 should focus on the same. If a user moving through the default branch has not completed the first step of sharing the personal information itself, the default branch should have communications to nudge them to do the same.
The strategy is to create a drip campaign and thus after every communication stage, you can have a Has done event stage to look for the event to be triggered as the next step. The “Yes” path of the stage can have a ""Goto"" stage connecting it to the first communication in the previous branch; the “No” path can have another communication.
For example, the default branch should have a Has done event to look for the “BFSI-LoanApplicationPersonalDetailsFilled” event and the Yes path has a ""Goto"" stage connecting the first communication from Branch 3 to the user. The No path has another communication to target the user to get them to fill in their personal details. 
Add as many action campaigns you want, from WhatsApp to Push, OSM or In-App based on your preference, to nudge the user for both getting their feedback and sending a message. Make sure to have some gap between any two communications to avoid spamming the user by using a Wait stage, especially in the Yes path of your “Has done events”. For more information, refer to Add Controls to Flow.
Click Publish.

It is usually more cost-effective to retain the existing users than to acquire new ones, and making users renew the subscription is the best way of holding on to them. This also helps you to increase your revenue.
Moreover, this process will help us get a better feedback from users when you see a lesser motivation to renew. This will help us solve issues and thus finally help us provide a better customer experience.

While the Winback Journey can be highly beneficial, it is worth noting that it is not guaranteed to work every time. It is essential to evaluate the success of each Flow/Campaign and adjust your strategy based on what works and what does not work.

In this article, we will create a Flow campaign to engage with your inactive customers and nudge them to purchase a product. We will use the Conditional Split and Next Best Action features in Flows to achieve this use case.

Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phone:

Users receive an email:

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user completing a major conversion event such as product purchases or subscribing after a free trial based on your industry. For this example, we will consider ""Product Purchased"" as the end goal. It is also important to track other related information with respect to the event such as the platform, product ID, brand, price in each of those events. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Events to track the action of a user opening your app or website and related information such as the platform, app version, timestamp in each of those events. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide. For this example, we will name the event as ""App/Site Opened"".
User properties to track the last seen date and life time value of the users. To understand how to track this information through user properties, refer to the Developer Guide. For this example, we will name the user properties as ""Last Seen"" and ""LTV"" respectively.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Create a Flow

In this section, let us create a Flow to engage with your inactive customers and nudge them to purchase a product:

Add Flow Details
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Flows and click + Create flow, or click + Create new, and then click Flow.
Click + Start with a blank canvas. You are taken to the first step “Details and goals”.
Enter the following flow details:

Flow Name: Enter a flow name. For example, ""Winback Journey"".
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Under the Conversion goal section, turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by doing the event ""Product Purchase"". This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user completes the payment successfully to purchase a new product.

Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user inside the flow. 
Under Users enter the flow section, select the At Fixed Time card. 
Select the frequency at which the Flow should run. For this example, select the Monthly option and mention the start time and end time.
Click Next to move to the second step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you will select the target audience for your Flow.
Under Audience, select users who have their Last Seen User property before 60 days ago. 
Click Next to move to the canvas section where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to move through.
Define Flow Structure
Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed.
Under Conditions, add the entry condition as “Conditional Split” to split users based on the LTV they have. Doing this will help us focus differently on users based on their interaction with our services during their active days.
For example, users who have an LTV of 10K are super active and have purchased a lot and thus nudging them with offers with multiple fallback attempts would be a good investment. While using a similar strategy for users with an LTV of say a few hundreds might not be good use of our investment because each message costs us.
To do the same, click the edit icon of the added Conditional Split stage.

Add a Next Best Action (NBA) stage in the first two branches and a channel of your choice in the third branch. Through these action campaigns, we can make sure to provide offers for them or ask for feedback on what went wrong, or announce recently launched products for sale to grab their interests. The tone of the message can be of creating FOMO for users in branch 1 whereas the tone can be of urgency and insisting in branch 2. However, we can probably ignore or just interact with them through in a neutral tone for the Others branch because they are more likely users who just used a product for a few days. For more information, refer to Next Best Action in Flows.

info	

Information




The Next Best Action option under Action is available only in the Enterprise plan and it is an add-on for other plans.

It is important to note that adding an NBA will help us reach out to each user in the right channel at the right time. This will help us increase the chance of higher engagement which in turn will help us to improve conversion. 
To define your Next Best Action stage, hover your mouse on the same and click on the edit icon. The Next best action pop-up is displayed.

From the Choose a fallback channel drop-down list, select a channel. A fallback channel is used when MoEngage does not have enough data to predict what is the preferred channel for a user.
In the Default time to send section, select an option. The default time is used when MoEngage does not have enough data to predict what is the best time to send the communication to a user.
Click Done.
Define the message in each of the channels (Push, Email, and SMS) that you would like to use.
If you have additional information about the users such as their name and gender, use the same to personalize the message while editing your Action campaign. Including such details will make the message more contextual and thereby increasing the chance of making the user feel connected. For more information, refer to Personalization in Flows.
After the NBA stage above or the Action stage based on the branch, you can have a “Has Clicked Campaign” stage to check if users have interacted with the message.
If yes, check if they have done the “App/Site Opened” event using the ""Has done event"".
If they have not interacted with the message, send another campaign. For example, a Push notification.
Even after such repeated check-ins, if the user is not interacting or opening the app, we can probably ask for Feedback and then exit them from the flow.
For people who are moving in the positive direction such as interacting with the message and have opened the app or site, we can follow up with messages nudging them to do actions that are further down in the funnel such as adding a product to wishlist, adding it to cart, or purchasing the product.
Make sure to have some gap between any two communication to avoid spamming the user by using a Wait Stage. For more information, refer to Add Controls to Flow.
Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a Flow campaign to engage with your inactive customers and nudge them to purchase a product.

Now that we have published the Flow, we can analyze how well our Flow is performing.
We can understand how many users entered the flow because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “User Entered Flow” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Users who have entered/exited the Flow.
We can also understand how users actually purchased a product because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “Flow Trip Conversion” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Conversion Tracking and Attribution in Flows."

How to Reduce Browse Abandonment
Introduction

Browse abandonment is when a customer visits a website, browses its pages and products, but leaves the site without making any purchase. This is one of the most common and yet difficult situations for marketers to handle, especially with the current short attention span of digital users. We must bring the customers back to the site and nudge them to complete the purchase. This can help increase conversion rates and thus help us avoid losing new users and revenue.

In this article, we will create a Flow to nudge users to complete their purchases.

Expected Result

Users receive a push notification on their phone to return to shopping:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user searching for an item and related information such as the platform, searched product’s ID, name, and price. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide. In this example, we will name the event “Product Viewed.”
Events to track the actions of a user adding the items to a cart and purchasing the product. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide. In this example, we will name the events “addedToCart” and “Product Purchased,” respectively.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Create a Flow

In this section, let us create a Flow to reduce browse abandonment and nudge users to move down the funnel:

Flow Details
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Flows and click + Create flow, or click + Create new, and then click Flow.
Use the Browse Abandonment Multi Channel template template and customize it, or click + Start with a blank canvas to start building your flow for the use case from scratch.

You are taken to the first step, “Details and goals.""
Enter the following flow details:

Flow Name: Enter a flow name. For example, ""Browse Abandonment Journey.""
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Under the Conversion goal section, turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by performing the event “Product Purchased.” This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user purchases a policy.
Click Next to move to the second step, “When will users enter the flow."" This step helps you define when to allow the user by mentioning the trigger conditions. For this use case, the event is “Product Viewed.”
Under Users enter the flow, select On event trigger. 
In the IF user section, select the event “Product Viewed” that gets triggered when a user visits a product page.
Click + Add Filter to add additional filters to include only those users who have not added the product to the cart in the flow by choosing the event “addedToCart.""
In the THEN enter the user section, select With Delay and define it based on the requirement. This will be the maximum time the user will be evaluated to fulfill the conditions from the time the first condition is fulfilled. 
In the Flow schedule section, define the flow's start and end times if necessary. By default, the flow will start “As soon as possible” and never end.
Turn the Limit user entry into this flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow. Defining such limits helps you control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience. Users are highly likely to match the browse abandonment flow’s entry rules more often and thus might enter the flow too many times. Defining the maximum time a user can enter will help you avoid the possibility of spamming a user too much and thus provide a better user experience. 
Click Next to move to the third step, “Who will enter the flow.” This is where you select the target audience for your Flow.
In the Audience section, select All users.

Click Next to move to the canvas section, where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to follow.
Add Flow Structure
Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed where you can choose an action campaign from the range of options under Actions, including Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp, to send a message. You can also display a banner using the On-site Messaging (OSM) or In-app Messaging channel or use Facebook or Google remarketing. In this use case, let's select Push. 
If you have additional information about the users, such as their name and gender, use it to personalize the message while editing your Action campaign. Also, including details about the product viewed, such as the name, image, or URL, helps make the message more contextual, thereby increasing the chance of intriguing the users and bringing them back to the site/app. For more information, refer to Personalization in Flows.
After defining an Action campaign, add a Has done event stage to check if the user has converted by choosing the ""Product Purchased"" event from the drop-down list.
Turn the Keep evaluating for the next toggle on to define the maximum time to wait for the user to execute the event. For our use case, select 2 hours. 
Add as many action campaigns as you want to nudge the user. Make sure to have some gap between any two communications to avoid spamming the user by using a Wait stage, especially in the Yes path of your “Has done events.” For more information, refer to Add Controls to Flow. 
Click Publish.

How to Retarget Dropped-Off Customers
Introduction

As marketers, understanding users who drop off before achieving the end goal we have for them is important. This helps marketers retarget users and thus reduce our drop-offs.

In this article, we will understand how to target users who have dropped off before purchasing an item after viewing the same, through the following steps:

Create a Funnel to identify the users.
Create a segment using this funnel definition.
Create a Push campaign using the segment to target dropped-off users.
Expected Result

Users who drop off before purchasing an item after adding it to the cart will see a Push Notification:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user searching for an item, and related information such as the platform, searched product’s ID, name, price, and other related information. In this example, we will name the event as ""Product Viewed”. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Events to track the action of a user adding the items to a cart and purchasing a product. In this example, we will name the event as ""addedToCart” and “Product Purchased” respectively. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Funnels enabled for your account. 
Find Users Through Funnel Analysis

Funnel Analysis helps us select different events and find the count of users who have performed those events. In this section, let us find users who have dropped off without purchasing an item after viewing the same in the last 30 days.

Navigate to the MoEngage dashboard.
From the left navigation, select Analyze > Funnels.
Under Steps, from the first drop-down list, select ""Product Viewed"".
From the second drop-down list, select ""addedToCart"".
To add more events, click + Add Step and select ""Product Purchased"" from the drop-down list.

Click + OR to add other events to each step. This can be helpful if you have multiple events for different platforms or different actions that are part of same step that leads to the end goal, as shown below:

This essentially considers people who have done the (Product Viewed or Product Searched), (addedToCart or Buy Now), and Product Purchased events.
In the Filter Users section, select All users because we want to perform this analysis on all users and not a specific segment of users. 

In the Funnel Options section, enter the following details:

Field	Description
Funnel Type	

For our use case, select “Unique Users” because we want to get unique user count.

 

It can also help you see the time users take to complete all the events mentioned above.


Duration	For our use case, select “Last 30 days” to define the time period to be considered for the analysis.
Funnel split	

Keep the default value.


Holding Attribute
	

Keep the default value.


Funnel window	For our use case, select 7 days so that the resultant analysis considers a maximum gap of 7 days from the time the user did ""Product Viewed"" to ""Product Purchased"". This option helps you define the maximum time gap between the first and the last event.
Order	For our use case, turn this toggle on to consider only those users who have done the defined events in the same order as you have defined.
The following images show an example of how you can define the options:

Click APPLY. As expected, the chart shows the drop-offs in users who did the events from ""Product Viewed"" to ""Product Purchased"".


Now that we have competed our funnel analysis, let us create a custom segment to retarget users.

Retarget Users Through Segmentation

In this section, let us create a custom segment to retarget users who have done the ""addedToCart"" event, but have not done the ""Product Purchased"" event.

Click the ""Step 3 Product Purchased"" column (or the third column). The Create segment pop-up is displayed:

Keep the default selection of the Static segment option. This means that the users who are the result of the current analysis at this point alone are considered for the segment.
If you want, you can select Dynamic segment. This refreshes the segment dynamically and gets the users who fulfill the criteria in the last 30 days.
In the Segment name field, enter a name for the segment. For example, ""AbandonCart_Users""
Select the Take action on the Custom Segment checkbox .
Select the Create campaign for this segment option.
From the Campaign channel drop-down list, select ""Push Campaign"" because we want to send a push notification to users.
From the Delivery type drop-down list, select ""One Time Push Campaign"" because we want to send the push notification to users only once.

Click Create. We are taken to the Push campaign creation page.
Create a Push campaign. For instructions on creating a Push campaign, refer to Create Push Campaigns.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a Funnel to identify the users who have dropped off before purchasing an item after adding it to the cart and created a segment using the funnel definition, and then used the segment to create a Push campaign to target the dropped-off users.

For high value products or products with longer conversion, we can use Flows to send multiple communications to the user across channels. We can further analyse user journeys using User Paths in MoEngage."

How to Create Welcome Experience for New Users
Introduction

First impressions last forever!

Creating meaningful experiences for the users as soon as they install our app or sign up on our website, provides us an opportunity to create a lasting impact and make them reach the ""Aha moment"" sooner. This in turn will have them hooked to the offering and take them in the path towards becoming a loyal user. Thus, a well crafted welcome journey helps in onboarding, engaging, and retaining our users in the long run.

In this article, we will use MoEngage Flows to create a welcome experience for new users on your e-commerce store. We will send communications to the users based on their actions on the first visit. Example actions:

User has not created an account with us.
User has created an account but has not made a purchase.
User created an account and made their first purchase in the same session.

The third branch is especially helpful when users create an account during the checkout process. This is an important branch because it is a common behavior in e-commerce.

Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phone as a welcome message:




library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user installing your app or signing up in the app and the related information such as the platform, source, app version in each of those events. In this example, we will name the event as “User Installs the App” and ""Sign Up"" respectively. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Events to track the desired action you expect the user to take as soon as they join your product for the first time and the related information. It can be completing their profile, purchasing a product/offering, or joining the email newsletter. In this example, we will name the event as “Product Purchased” that triggers when the users purchase a product from the app. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Create a Flow

In this section, let us create a Flow to engage with your customers and welcome them to the app.

Add Flow Details
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Flows and click + Create flow, or click + Create new, and then click Flow. The Create new flow page is displayed.
Use the “Onboard Customers - Single Channel” or ”Onboard Customers - Multi-channel” template and customize it or click + Start with a blank canvas to start building your flow for the use case from scratch.

You are taken to the first step “Details and goals”.
Enter the following flow details:

Flow Name: Enter a flow name. For example, ""Welcome Journey"".
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Under the Conversion goal section, turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by doing the event “Product Purchased”. This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user purchases a product.

Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user by mentioning the trigger conditions. For our example, the event can be “User Installs the App”.
In the IF user section, select the event “User Installs the App” that gets triggered when a user installs your app.
In the THEN enter the user section, select the Immediately option.

In the Flow Schedule section, define a start time and an end time to the flow if required. By default, the flow will start “As soon as possible” and will never end.
Turn the Limit user entry into this flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow. Defining such limits helps you control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience.

Click Next to move to the third step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you select the target audience and control groups for your Flow.
In the Audience section, select All users. For a user to be eligible to enter an event-triggered flow, they must be part of the target audience before they do the required event.

Click Next to move to the canvas section where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to move through.
Define Flow Structure
Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed.
Under Conditions, add the entry condition as “Conditional Split”.
Use this stage to define checks that split users: 

Who have signed up and purchased a product by themselves in one branch
Who have signed up alone in a different branch 
Who have not even signed up, in the default branch.

For the first branch, from the drop-down list under the Users enter this branch if section, search for the event “Sign Up” and click  + Filter to search and add the “Product Purchased” event.
For the second branch, search and add the “Sign Up” event alone. You can also name each of the branches for better discoverability about what each branch is for.
Turn the Keep evaluating for the next toggle on and enter a suitable value because this is the maximum time a user is evaluated for in Branch 1. However, users who have done both the events in this case or who match the condition of Branch 1 move immediately. For more information, refer to Branching of Users via Condition Stages.

In each branch, we send campaigns based on the context.
In the first branch, we send a Push Notification welcoming and thanking the users who have signed up and purchased a product.
In the second branch, we nudge users to purchase a product of their interest after signing up.
In the last branch, we have users who just installed the app and not created an account. We nudge them to sign-up to get the most of the app.
Use additional information about the user such as the user's name, gender, or any other information to personalize the message while editing your action campaign. Personalized messages can perform better than generic messages because the users feel valued and connected to the brand. For more information, refer to Personalization in Flows.
After defining an Action campaign, add a Has done event stage to check if the user has performed the action you are trying to nudge them to. For branch 2, the event is “Product Purchased”, while the default branch is “Sign up”.
Turn the Keep evaluating for the next toggle on to define the maximum time to wait for the user to execute the event. You can enter any time limit that you deem fit.
In the Yes path, you can add “Goto” stages to move the user from one path to the other by connecting to a stage from a different path. For example, you can add a ""Goto"" stage in the ""Has done event"" stage’s Yes path of Branch 2 to the Action stage of Branch 1.




Add as many action campaigns you want to nudge the user in the No path. Make sure to have some gap between any two communications to avoid spamming the user by using a Wait stage, especially in the Yes path of your “Has done events”. For more information, refer to Add Controls to Flow.

Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a Flow to create an impressive welcome experience for new users.

Now that we have published the Flow, we can analyze how well our Flow is performing.
We can understand how many users entered the flow because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “User Entered Flow” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Users who have entered/exited the Flow.
We can also understand how many users actually converted because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “Flow Trip Conversion” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Conversion Tracking and Attribution in Flows."

How to Cross-Sell Bill Payments
Introduction

Cross-selling is one of the effective ways for a marketer to increase stickiness and customer lifetime value (CLV) of users. FinTech applications process several types of Bill Payments (Gas, Electricity, Mobile, Broadband, and so on). Bill payments tend to be sticky as most of them have one time effort in set up and subsequent payments can be automated with autopay options.

In this article, we will create a Flow campaign to nudge users who made their first bill payment in any category, to also use it for other bills. We will use the Conditional Split feature in Flows to achieve this use case.

Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phone to pay bills:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a bill payment for a user and related information such as the category, bill amount, paid date, next due date. In this example, we will name the event as ""Bill Payment Completed"". To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Create a Flow

In this section, let us create a Flow to nudge your customers to pay other bills when they pay for a bill for the first time in the app.

Add Flow Details
Navigate to Engage > Flows and click + Create Flow or navigate to the sidebar, click + Create new, and then click Flow.
Click + Start with a blank canvas to start building your flow for the use case. You are taken to the first step “Details and goals”. 
Enter the following details:

Flow Name: Enter a flow name. For example, ""Cross Sell Bill payments"".
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Under the Conversion goal section, turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by doing the event “Bill Payment Completed”. This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user completes the payment successfully to a bill.

Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user by mentioning the trigger conditions. For our example, the event can be “Bill Payment Completed"".
In the IF user section, select the event ""Bill Payment Completed"" that gets triggered when a user pays a bill successfully.
In the THEN enter the user section, select the Immediately option.

In the Flow Schedule section, define a start time and an end time to the flow if required. By default, the flow will start “As soon as possible” and will never end.
Turn the Limit user entry into this flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow. Defining such limits helps you control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience.

Click Next to move to the third step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you select the target audience and control groups for your Flow.
In our use case, you are cross-selling to users who paid a bill for the first time so the audience is essentially users who have never paid. You will allow the user to this flow just after their purchase. On the User behavior tab, select ""Has Not Executed"" in the first drop-down list, and then select the ""Bill Payment Completed"" event in the second drop-down list. The target audience definition is shown below:

Click Next to move to the canvas section where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to move through.
Define Flow Structure
Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed.
Under Conditions, add the entry condition as “Conditional Split” to split users based on the category for which they have paid and entered the flow.

To do the same, click the edit icon of the added Conditional Split stage.

Select ""Trigger condition: Bill Payment Completed"" under the Flow entry events section. Selecting this option helps to split the users among branches based on the event that allows them to enter and not to expect a new event after they enter the flow. For more information, refer to Branching of Users via Condition Stages.

Click + Attribute and select the ""Category"" attribute, the one which will have the type of bill that the user has paid.

When a conditional split shown in the image above is defined, users who enter this flow by paying a mobile bill will go through Branch 1, which is named as Mobile Bill. Other users will go through the Default Branch.
Add additional categories using the conditional split based on your requirements.

Add an Action stage from which you would like to message your users for cross-selling. Splitting users like this helps the message to be specific enough to nudge a user to try out Electricity Payment, House Rent, and others when they enter the Mobile Bill branch and vice versa in other branches.
To make this process simple, you can define your action stage in Branch 1, copy it to other branches, and do minor edits instead of starting from scratch.
Hover the mouse on the defined stage and click the copy icon.

Click the + icon where you want to add the stage and click the top section of the drawer.
The same Push stage with exactly same configurations as in the Electricity Bill branch is added.
Do the required modifications so that here the nudge is to try Mobile Bills, House Rent, and so on.
Use additional information about the user such as the user's name, gender, or any other information to personalize the message while editing your action campaign. Also include details about their last payment’s time taken or other related information. Personalized messages can perform better than generic messages because the users feel valued and connected to the brand. For more information, refer to Personalization in Flows.
After defining an Action campaign in each of your branches, add a Has done event stage to check if the user has converted, by choosing the “Bill Payment Completed” event from the drop-down list or any other goal of yours.
Turn the Keep evaluating for the next toggle on to define the maximum time to wait for the user to execute the event. For our use case, enter 2 days.

Like you did for actions stages, you can copy this condition stage also across all branches. For more information, refer to Add Actions to Flows.
Add as many action campaigns you want to nudge the user in the No path. Make sure to have some gap between any two communications to avoid spamming the user by using a Wait stage, especially in the Yes path of your “Has done events”. For more information, refer to Add Controls to Flow.

Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a Flow campaign to nudge users who made their first bill payment in any category, to also use it for other bills.

Now that we have published the Flow, we can analyze how well our Flow is performing.
We can understand how many users entered the flow because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “User Entered Flow” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Users who have entered/exited the Flow.

How to Reduce eKYC Abandonment
Introduction

Electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) is the most preferred way for FinTechs companies to verify customers and it is often mandated by regulatory bodies. However, the eKYC process can often be lengthy and need users to submit details that are not readily available to them. This is one of the most common yet difficult situations to handle for marketers especially with the current short span of attention of the digital users. We can set up Flows aimed at bringing the customers back to the app and nudging them to complete the KYC. This can help in higher conversion rates and thus help us avoid losing new users and revenue.

Generally, eKYC applications have two stages: filling personal information and uploading relevant documents. In this article, we will create a Flow campaign to nudge users to complete their eKYC process, depending on the stage they dropped off.

Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phone to complete their KYC:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user starting the eKYC approval process and related information such as the platform, bought product’s ID, name, price. In this example, we will name the event as “eKYC Started”. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Events to track the action of a user completing different parts of the eKYC process such as filling their personal information and uploading documents and related information such as the platform, user ID, lead ID, app version. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide. In this example, we will name the events as follows:

eKYC_PersonalDetailsFilled
eKYC_DocumentsUploaded
Events to track the action of a user submitting the eKYC application and related information such as the platform, lead ID, customer ID, app version. In this example, we will name the event as “eKYC Submitted”. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Create a Flow

In this section, let us create a Flow to nudge your customers to complete their eKYC process.

Add Flow Details
Navigate to Engage > Flows and click + Create Flow or navigate to the sidebar, click + Create new, and then click Flow.
Click + Start with a blank canvas to start building your flow for the use case. You are taken to the first step “Details and goals”.
Enter the following details:

Flow name: Enter a flow name. For example, ""eKYC Abandonment Journey"".
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Under the Conversion goal section, turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by doing the event “eKYC Submitted”. This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user submits their eKYC.

Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user by mentioning the trigger conditions. For our example, the event can be “eKYC Started”.
Under Users enter the flow section, select On event trigger.
In the IF user section, select the event “eKYC Started” which gets triggered when a user starts their eKYC process.
In the THEN enter the user section, select the Immediately option.

In the Flow schedule section, define a start time and an end time to the flow if required. By default, the flow will start “As soon as possible” and will never end.
Do not turn the Limit user entry into this flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow.
Note that the users are highly likely to match the eKYC Application Abandonment flow’s entry rules more often and thus might enter the flow too many times. Defining such limits helps you control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience.

Click Next to move to the third step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you select the target audience for your Flow.
In the Audience section, select All users. For a user to be eligible to enter an event-triggered flow, they must be part of the target audience before they do the required event.

Click Next to move to the canvas section where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to move through.
Define Flow Structure
Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed.
Under Conditions, add the entry condition as “Conditional Split”. 
Define the possible movement of your users down the steps of eKYC approval process by starting with: 

Branch 1 checking for the “eKYC submitted” event 
Branch 2 having the “eKYC_DocumentsUploaded” event 
Branch 3 having the “eKYC_PersonalDetailsFilled” event
Note that the reason to have the checks in the reverse order is because of the ranking each branch of a conditional split has. For more information, refer to to Branching of Users via Condition Stages. 
Turn the Keep evaluating for the next toggle on to define the maximum time to wait for the user to execute the event. For our use case, enter 30 mins.

Add corresponding communications to each branch of the conditional split to acknowledge their eKYC application being successfully completed by suggesting their next course of action or nudge them to move to the next step in the process based on their current stage.
For example, a user moving down branch 3 has completed personal information but did not share their documents for approval. So the communications in branch 3 should focus on the same. If a user moving through the default branch has not completed the first step of sharing the personal information itself, the default branch should have communications to nudge them to do the same.
The strategy is to create a drip campaign and thus after every communication stage, you can have a Has done event stage to look for the event to be triggered as the next step. The “Yes” path of the stage can have a ""Goto"" stage connecting it to the first communication in the previous branch; the “No” path can have another communication.
For example, the default branch should have a Has done event to look for the “eKYC_PersonalDetailsFilled” event and the Yes path has a ""Goto"" stage connecting the first communication from Branch 3 to the user. The No path has another communication to target the user to get them to fill in their personal details.

Add as many action campaigns you want to nudge the user for both getting their feedback and sending a message. Make sure to have some gap between any two communications to avoid spamming the user by using a Wait stage, especially in the Yes path of your “Has done events”. For more information, refer to Add Controls to Flow.
Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a Flow campaign to nudge users to complete their eKYC process, depending on the stage they dropped off.

Now that we have published the Flow, we can analyze how well our Flow is performing.
We can understand how many users entered the flow because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “User Entered Flow” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Users who have entered/exited the Flow.
We can also understand how many users actually completed their eKYC because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “Flow Trip Conversion” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Conversion Tracking and Attribution in Flows."

How to Nudge Your Guests to Extend Their Stay
Introduction

Travel and Hospitality is a unique industry with multiple avenues to upsell between booking date and service date. Extension of the stay and room upgrade are two major upsell campaigns that tend to have better conversions. Travelers who extend their stay often tend to become loyal users who give repeat business and are more likely to give positive reviews.

In this article, we will use MoEngage Flows to nudge users 2 days before their checkout date to extend their hotel stay, by providing personalized offers or coupon codes.

Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phone to extend their stay:

Users receive an Email message to extend their stay:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a room booked by a user and related information such as the booking ID, check-in date, check-out date, bill amount, hotel name, room type, meals included, free cancel date. In this example, we will name the event as “Booked Room"". To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Events to track the action of a user cancelling the booking and related information such as the booking ID, check-in date, check-out date, bill amount, hotel name, room type, meals included, free cancel date. In this example, we will name the event as “Booking Cancelled"". To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Events to track the action of a user extending the booking and related information such as the booking ID, check-in date, check-out date, bill amount, hotel name, room type, meals included, free cancel date. In this example, we will name the event as “Booking Extended"". To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Personalised triggers and condition feature to be enabled for your account.
Create a Flow

In this section, let us create a Flow to nudge your customers to extend their stay from 2 days, before their check-out date.

Add Flow Details
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Flows and click + Create flow, or click + Create new, and then click Flow.
Click + Start with a blank canvas. You are taken to the first step “Details and goals”.
Enter the following flow details:

Flow Name: Enter a flow name. For example, ""Extending Stay Journey"".
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Under the Conversion goal section, turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by doing the event ""Booking Extended"". This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user extends their stay at the hotel.


Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user by mentioning the trigger conditions. For our example, the event can be “Booked Room”.
In the IF user section, select the event “Booked Room”, which gets triggered when a user books a room at the hotel.
Remember that a user can have multiple bookings at a specified time for future dates and they can cancel any one of them. So you cannot define checks just on events that trigger on room booking and cancellation. The following example explains it:
John, a user of your platform booked a room in Hotel A from Dec 26–30 and in Hotel B from Dec 31 to Jan 3. On or before Dec 24, if he cancels his reservation in Hotel B and if the flow has checks only on the ""Booked Room"" and ""Booking Extended"" events, John will not enter the flow and thus will not get any nudges to extend the stay because you would have received the ""Booked Room"" and ""Booking Extended"" events.


To avoid this, you must define the check in a manner that MoEngage can identify for which ""Booked Room"" event the cancellation is coming up. So to achieve this, do the following:
In the IF user section, select the event ""Booked Room"".
Click + Filter.
From the new drop-down list, select the event ""Booking Cancelled"".
Click + Attributes and from the Select attribute drop-down list, select ""Booking ID"" for each booking.
Select the ""is"" operator from the second drop-down list and select the ""Event Attribute"" in the third drop-down list from the left.
Select ""Booking ID"" for each booking in the event ""Booked Room"".
During these configurations, MoEngage prompts you to compare the ""Booking Cancelled"" event’s ""Booking ID"" with the ""Booked Room"" event’s ""Booking ID"" for each instance of each event received for each user. So considering the same example mentioned above, John enters this flow this time because the Flow does not just check the received events but also checks the attribute.

Select the With Delay option and set values for the message trigger as follows: 2 Days Before Checkout Date.

In the Flow Schedule section, define a start time and an end time to the flow if required. By default, the flow will start “As soon as possible” and will never end.
Turn the Limit user entry into this flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow. Defining such limits helps you control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience.

Click Next to move to the third step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you select the target audience for your Flow.
In the Audience section, select All users. For a user to be eligible to enter an event-triggered flow, they must be part of the target audience before they do the required event.

Click Next to move to the canvas section where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to move through.
Define Flow Structure
Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed from where you can choose an action campaign from the range of options under Actions including Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp to send a message. 

If you have additional information about the users such as their name and gender, use the same to personalize the message while editing your action campaign. Also, including the details about the hotel booked such as the room type and image helps making the message more contextual and thereby increasing the chance of making the user feel connected and extend their stay. For more information, refer to Personalization in Flows.
After defining an Action campaign, add a Has done event stage to check if the user has converted by choosing the ""Booking Extended"" event from the drop-down list or any other goal of yours.
Turn the Keep evaluating for the next toggle on to define the maximum time to wait for the user to execute the event. For our use case, select 1 hour.

In the ""No"" path, you can check if the user clicked the previous message and based on that you can send further reminders. To do the same, you can click the + icon and then you will see different condition options under Conditions based on the action campaign used above. In case of Push and Emails, you will have the Has clicked push notification and Has clicked email message options respectively. You can select them.

By default, the evaluation window is for 24 hours. You can change it based on your requirement by editing the stage.
In the ""Yes"" path, you can add another Email stage because the user has clicked the Email before and is likely active on Email. While in case of the No path, you can add a Push stage or other channels such as WhatsApp because Email has not worked previously and you have only 24 more hours to convert the user.
In each of the campaign stage, you can send coupon codes to make the offer more lucrative for the user.
Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we used MoEngage Flows to nudge users 2 days before their checkout date to extend their hotel stay, by providing personalized offers or coupon codes.

Now that we have published the Flow, we can analyze how well our campaign is performing.
We can understand how many users entered the flow because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “User Entered Flow” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Users who have entered/exited the Flow.
We can also understand how many extended their stay because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “Flow Trip Conversion” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Conversion Tracking and Attribution in Flows."

How to Reduce Card Application Abandonment
Introduction

Card applications can often be lengthy and need users to submit details that are not readily available to them. This is one of the most common yet difficult situations to handle for marketers especially with the current short span of attention of the digital users. We can set up Flows aimed at bringing the customers back to the site and nudging them to complete the application. This can help in higher conversion rates and thus help us avoid losing new users and revenue.

In this article, we will create a Flow campaign to nudge users to complete their card application through the following steps:

Identify exit intent from the customer and show a message on the website prompting them not to drop off or generate a lead.
Send follow-up message(s) through SMS after 1 hour of dropping off from the application process.
Analyze how many users submitted the form successfully through this flow.
Expected Result

Users who try to exit without completing the card application process will see a website pop-up:

Users who drop off from the application process will see an SMS notification:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Event to track the action of a user starting the application for the credit card and related information such as the platform, applied card name, annual renewal fee, joining fee. In this example, we will name the event as “BFSI-applicationFormStarted”. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developers Guide.
Event to track the action of a user completing the application and related information such as the platform, applied card name, annual renewal fee, joining fee. In this example, we will name the event as “BFSI-applicationFormSubmitted”. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developers Guide.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Step 1: General Setup
Navigate to Engage > Flows and click + Create Flow or navigate to the sidebar, click + Create new, and then click Flow.
Click + Start with a blank canvas to move to the first step “Details and goals”. 
Enter the following details:

Flow name: Enter ""CreditCard Application Abandonment"".
Flow tags: Select a tag for your flow.
Under the Conversion goal section, from the Event name drop-down list, select ""BFSI-applicationFormSubmitted"". This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user submits the application form.

Turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by doing the event “BFSI-applicationFormSubmitted”.
Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user by mentioning the trigger conditions.
In the Users enter the flow section, select On event trigger.
From the drop-down list in the IF user section, select the “BFSI-applicationFormStarted” event that gets triggered when a user starts the application process for the credit card.
In the THEN enter the user section, select the Immediately option.

In the Flow Schedule section, keep the default values. By default, the flow will start “As soon as possible” and will never end. Define a start time and an end time to the flow if required.
Turn the Limit user entry into this flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow. We can set this limit as 2 for this example. 

info	

Information




Users are highly likely to match the Card Application Abandonment flow’s entry rules more often and thus might enter the flow too many times. Defining such limits helps you control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience.



Click Next to move to the third step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you select the target audience and control groups for your Flow.
In the Audience section, select All users because we want to send communications to all the users who started application for the card and have not submitted it. 

Click Next to move to the canvas section.

Now that we have competed the general setup, let us define the Flow structure that we want the user to move through.

Step 2: Exit Intent Flow

In this step, we will show a pop-up to our users to continue with the form application to get necessary benefits from the card. We also nudge them to leave their phone number with us if they decide to abandon the application. The following image shows a sample of the nudge shown to the customer through the exit intent flow:

Let us perform the following steps to achieve this use case:

Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed from where you can choose an action campaign from the range of options under Actions including Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp to send a message. You can also display a banner on the On-site or In-app channel, or use Facebook or Google remarketing.
For our scenario, select the On-site option first because you can predict the exit intent of the user through this and show a pop-up in close to real time. For more information, refer to Exit Intent Technology.

Hover your mouse on the On-site action and click the edit icon to start defining the stage:
In the Trigger criteria section, select On Exit Intent.

In the Target audience section, select All users because we want to nudge all the users who are trying to abandon the card application to finish it. 
Select your template from the next step and enter the details based on your offerings and make sure to intrigue the user from leaving and making them continue their application process.
Executing this step properly is important because the user has not yet provided any contact information for you to reach out to them. So make sure to collect their contact information such as phone number so that you can always use this as a lead through your sales team if the user leaves after the same.
For more information on saving the value from the user through the OSM, refer to Lead Generation.

Now that we have defined the exit intent flow, let us add an SMS stage in the Flow to follow up with users.

Step 3: Send Follow-Up Messages

In this step, let us send follow-up messages to the users who did not finish the card application and left their phone number from our exit intent campaign. We will send follow-up message(s) through SMS after 1 hour of dropping off from the application process.

Add a Has Done Event stage to check if the user has submitted the lead generation form through the ""MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED"" event and has not completed the card application. 
Turn the Keep Evaluating for the next toggle on to define the maximum time to wait for the user to execute the event. In this example, we keep the wait time a 1 hour. 

We need not edit the ""No"" branch because we cannot retarget the users who have not submitted their contact details.
In the ""Yes"" branch, click the + icon and add an SMS stage. 

info	

Information




All countries have different rules regarding how to collect consent to send SMS to users. Please make sure you collect the phone numbers in a manner compliant with your country.

Configure the SMS message:
Campaign name: Enter ""Card application abandonment SMS"".
SMS Sender: Select an SMS sender.
Message: Enter a message to nudge users to complete their application.

Click Done.  
At this point, your flow looks similar to the following image: 

Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a Flow that helps us nudge users not to leave card application half-way and send SMS to users who left the application without submitting.

Now that we have published the Flow, we can analyze how well our campaign is performing.
We can understand how many users came back to the card application because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “User Entered Flow” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Users who have entered/exited the Flow.
We can also understand how many users actually converted because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “Flow Trip Conversion” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Conversion Tracking and Attribution in Flows."

How to Convert Free Trial Users into Paid Users
Introduction

Free Trials have become an important strategy for growth teams to acquire new users. However, converting free trial users to paid users is often harder than acquiring new users. MoEngage helps in sending the right messages to users at the right time that can help in increasing conversions from free to paid users.

In this article, we will use MoEngage Flows to transition users from free trial to paid subscription. We will set up a multi-step, multi-channel journey over the free trial period for users to upgrade their plan.

Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phone to convert to a paid user:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user starting their trial period and the related information such as the platform, trial period end date, price, and other related information for this event. In this example, we will name the event as ""Trial Started"". To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Events to track the action of a user purchasing the subscription successfully and the related information such as the platform, subscription category, price, and other related information in each of those events. In this example, we will name the event as ""User Subscribed"". To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
User properties to track the subscription category of the users and renewal date. For our example, we will name the user properties as ""ENT - Subscription Category"" and ""ENT - Subscription Renew Date"", which will have the values “Trial Period” and ""Trial End Date"" respectively. To understand how to track this information through User Properties, refer to the Developer Guide.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Create a Flow

In this section, let us create a Flow to nudge your customers to convert from free trial period to paid subscription.

Add Flow Details

We will send a Push Notification after half the time of trial period is over and reach out to the user one week before the trial is over.

Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Flows and click + Create flow, or click + Create new, and then click Flow.
Click + Start with a blank canvas. You are taken to the first step “Details and goals”.
Enter the following flow details:

Flow Name: Enter a flow name. For example, ""Free Trial Conversion"".
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Under the Conversion goal section, turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by doing the event ""User Subscribed"". This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user completes the payment successfully to buy their subscription.

Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user inside the flow by mentioning the trigger conditions. For our example, the event can be “Trial Started”.
In the Users enter the flow section, select On event trigger.
In the IF user section, select the event ""Trial Started"", which gets triggered when a user starts their trial period.

In the Flow Schedule section, define a start time and an end time to the flow if required. By default, the flow will start “As soon as possible” and will never end.
Turn the Limit user entry into this flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow. Defining such limits helps you control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience.

Click Next to move to the third step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you select the target audience for your Flow.
In the Audience section, select All users.

Click Next to move to the canvas section where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to move through.
Define Flow Structure
Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed from where you can choose an Action campaign from the range of options under Actions including Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp to send a message. You can also display a banner on the On-site or In-app channel, or use Facebook or Google remarketing.


As suggested in the introduction, one of the best ways to handle the use case is to nudge the user with communications at a suitable interval throughout the trial period taking them through how they can get the most out of your product. You must also prompt the users with the premium features and their benefits. The list of Actions helps you achieve the same.
If you have additional information about the users such as their name and gender, use the same to personalize the message while editing your Action campaign. Including such details will make the message more contextual and thereby increasing the chance of making the user feel connected and buy the subscription. For more information, refer to Personalization in Flows.
You can send communications with the similar context for almost half of the free trial period by having Wait for/till stages between the communications. Having this stage helps you have a gap between your messages and thereby makes sure not to overwhelm your users.

The Wait for/till control helps you define the holding duration as follows:
Relative to the user’s entry using the Duration option
Mentioning a specific time slot, such as Weekdays from 10 AM to 5 PM using the Time slot option
Mentioning a specific date and time, such as Mondays at 9 AM or 1st Jan 2024 at 10 AM using the Date & Time option

Fore more information, refer to Add Controls to Flow.
After teasing them with the benefits of the platform and premium for half the time, you can now check if they have bought the subscription using the Has done event stage.

Select the event ”User Subscribed” from the drop-down list. 

In the No path of this stage, you have users who have not yet purchased. Add a Next Best Action, which helps you reach out to each user in the right channel at the right time. This helps you increase the chance of higher engagement, which in turn helps you improve conversion. For more information, refer to Next Best Action in Flows.

info	

Information




The Next Best Action option under Action is available only in the Enterprise plan and it is an add-on for other plans.

To define your Next Best Action stage, hover your mouse on the same and click on the edit icon. The Next best action pop-up is displayed.

From the Choose a fallback channel drop-down list, select a channel. A fallback channel is used when MoEngage does not have enough data to predict what is the preferred channel for a user.
In the Default time to send section, select an option. The default time is used when MoEngage does not have enough data to predict what is the best time to send the communication to a user.
Click Done.
Define the campaigns that are attached to the Next Best Action. Because you have already covered half of the time, you can change the tone to create an urgency to the user. You can remove any one from the three channels that get added.
Add more follow-ups with wait stages in between to nudge your users to purchase as soon as possible.
Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we used MoEngage Flows to transition users from free trial to paid subscription. We set up a multi-step, multi-channel journey over the free trial period for users to upgrade their plan.

Now that we have published the Flow, we can analyze how well it is performing.
We can understand how many users entered the flow because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “User Entered Flow” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Users who have entered/exited the Flow.

How Create Onboarding Experience in FinTech Products
Introduction

First impressions last forever!

Creating meaningful experiences for the users as soon as they install our app or sign up on our website, provides us an opportunity to create a lasting impact and make them reach the ""Aha moment"" sooner. This in turn will have them hooked to the offering and take them in the path towards becoming a loyal user. Thus, a well crafted welcome journey helps in onboarding, engaging, and retaining our users in the long run.

In this article, we will use MoEngage Flows to create a welcome experience for new users on your Insurance Product. We will send communications to the users based on their actions on the first visit. Example actions:

User has not created an account with us.
User has created an account but has not purchased a policy.
User created an account and bought their first policy in the same session.
Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phone after taking a health insurance:

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user installing your app or signing up in the app and the related information such as the platform, source, app version in each of those events. In this example, we will name the event as “User Installs the App” and ""Sign Up"" respectively. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Events to track the desired action you expect the user to take as soon as they join your product for the first time and the related information. It can be completing KYC process, purchasing a policy or offering, applying for a loan, or joining the email newsletter. In this example, we will name the event as “Policy Purchased” that triggers when the users purchase a policy from the app. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Create a Flow

In this section, let us create a Flow to engage with your customers and welcome them to the app.

Add Flow Details
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Flows and click + Create flow, or click + Create new, and then click Flow.
Use the ”Onboard Customers - Multi-channel” template and customize it or click + Start with a blank canvas to start building your flow for the use case from scratch.

You are taken to the first step “Details and goals”.
Enter the following flow details:

Flow Name: Enter a flow name. For example, ""Fintech Onboarding Journey"".
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Under the Conversion goal section, turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by doing the event “Policy Purchased”. This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user purchases a policy.

Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user by mentioning the trigger conditions. For this use case, the event is “User Installs the App”.
In the IF user section, select the event “User Installs the App” that gets triggered when a user installs your app.
In the THEN enter the user section, select the Immediately option.

In the Flow Schedule section, define a start time and an end time to the flow if required. By default, the flow will start “As soon as possible” and will never end.
Turn the Limit user entry into this flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow. Defining such limits helps you control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience.

Click Next to move to the third step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you select the target audience for your Flow.
In the Audience section, select All users. For a user to be eligible to enter an event-triggered flow, they must be part of the target audience before they do the required event.

Click Next to move to the canvas section where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to move through.
Define Flow Structure
Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed.
Under Conditions, add the entry condition as “Conditional Split”.
Use this stage to define checks that split users: 
Who have signed up and purchased a policy by themselves in one branch
Who have signed up alone in a different branch 
Who have not even signed up, in the default branch

For the first branch, from the drop-down list under the Users enter this branch if section, search for the event “Sign Up”. Click + Filter to search and add the “Policy Purchased” event.
For the second branch, search and add the “Sign Up” event alone.
Turn the Keep evaluating for the next toggle on and enter a suitable value because this is the maximum time a user is evaluated for in Branch 1. However, users who have done both the events in this case or who match the condition of Branch 1 move immediately. For more information, refer to Branching of Users via Condition Stages.

In each branch, we send campaigns based on the context.
In the first branch, we send a Push Notification welcoming and thanking the users who have signed up and purchased a policy.
In the second branch, we nudge users to purchase a policy of their interest after signing up.
In the last branch, we have users who just installed the app and did not create an account. We nudge them to sign-up to get the most of the app.
Use additional information about the user such as the user's name, gender, or any other information to personalize the message while editing your action campaign. Personalized messages can perform better than generic messages because the users feel valued and connected to the brand. For more information, refer to Personalization in Flows.
After defining an Action campaign, add a Has done event stage to check if the user has performed the action you are trying to nudge them to. For branch 2, the event is “Policy Purchased”, while the default branch is “Sign up”.
Turn the Keep evaluating for the next toggle on to define the maximum time to wait for the user to execute the event.
In the Yes path, add “Goto” stages to move the user from one path to the other by connecting to a stage from a different path. For example, add a ""Goto"" stage in the Has done event stage’s Yes path of Branch 2 to the Action stage of Branch 1.




Add as many Action campaigns you want to nudge the user in the No path, with some gap between any two communications. This helps to avoid spamming the user by using a Wait stage, especially in the Yes path of your “Has done events”. For more information, refer to Add Controls to Flow.

Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a Flow to nudge users to onboard a fintech customer effectively.

Now that we have published the Flow, we can analyze how well our Flow is performing.
We can understand how many users entered the flow because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “User Entered Flow” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Users who have entered/exited the Flow.
We can also understand how many users actually converted because of our campaign. Create a segmentation on the “Flow Trip Conversion” event by mentioning the “Flow ID”. For more information, refer to Conversion Tracking and Attribution in Flows."

Use GIFs in an Onboarding Walkthrough
Introduction

Effective user onboarding is crucial for driving app engagement and ensuring long-term retention. Leveraging GIFs within In-app messaging functionality offers a visually compelling and interactive means of guiding new users through initial interactions with the application.

For instance, consider a new user who has downloaded a beauty application and requires clear guidance on navigating the app to facilitate product orders, access exclusive discounts, and stay informed on the latest beauty news.

Advantages of using GIFs in an onboarding walkthrough
Enhanced visual communication: GIFs offer a simplified way to visually communicate an app's navigation and features, making complex processes easier to understand.
Demonstration of actions: GIFs can quickly demonstrate core functionalities and actions within the app, reducing the need for extensive written instructions.
Engagement and fun: Animated elements can more effectively capture users' attention than static images, making the onboarding process more enjoyable and memorable.
Contextual communication: GIFs can effectively communicate context without relying on text, such as demonstrating a loading spinner or a success checkmark.
Instructional aid: GIFs serve as mini-tutorials, making the learning process more intuitive and reducing the need for extensive written instructions.
Visual feedback: GIFs can give users immediate visual feedback on their actions, enhancing their interaction with the app.

This article will outline the process of creating an engaging onboarding walkthrough using GIFs within In-app messages. We will achieve this use case in two steps:

Identify the key onboarding steps and create GIFs
Create an In-app Messaging campaign
Expected Result

Users will experience a smooth and engaging onboarding and quickly understand key app features, which leads to increased user satisfaction and higher retention rates. Users will also easily navigate the app to make their first purchase, apply discounts, and read beauty articles, resulting in more frequent app usage.

Prerequisites

An event must be available in MoEngage to track the action of a user installing your app or signing up for your app and related information such as the platform, source, and app version in each event. In this example, we will use the event User Installs the App. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.

Step 1: Identify the Key Onboarding Steps and Create GIFs
Identify Key Onboarding Moments: Identify the essential steps and features that new users should understand during their initial interaction with the app. For our example, we aim to ensure that new users can effortlessly order products, discover and apply discounts, and access the latest beauty news.
Create Informative GIFs: Create a series of short, looping GIFs that effectively demonstrate each key feature or action. Ensure that the GIFs are visually captivating and easy to understand. For instance, include GIFs that include the essential steps that you identified previously. For example, inform new users about your products, explain how to apply discount codes, and guide users to the beauty news section. The following is a sample GIF:

Step 2: Create an In-App Messaging Campaign

In this section, we will create an In-app Messaging campaign targeting new users or users who have recently installed the app. We will incorporate the GIF you created earlier to enhance user onboarding.

Step 2.1: Target Users
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
On the All campaigns page, click + Create campaign.
Under Inbound, click In-app.

You are taken to the first step, Target users, in defining your campaign.
Define your campaign with a name and tags.
In the Target Platforms section, select Android and iOS.

In the Trigger Criteria section, click the On app open card. This will ensure that the In-app message is displayed to the users during onboarding when the app is opened.

In the Select trigger time section, select After Delay and set the trigger time for the In-app message to appear after 2 seconds of opening the app.

In the Target audience section:
Select the Filter users by option.
On the User behaviour tab, segment the audience to target only those users who have newly installed the app in the last three days.

Click Next to move to the second step, Content, where we will define the content for your campaign.
Step 2.2: Content
On the Prebuilt and saved templates tab, use the search box to search with the keyword nudge to find the nudge templates.
Select the Nudge - Image, text & button template.

Upload the created GIFs in the template in the Image section.

Add a concise and clear Call to action (CTA) text for the GIF.
Add navigation to the button so that when the user clicks it, they are redirected to the info page.

Modify the template's design accordingly. Follow the video below to edit the template's design.

Before publishing the campaign, test the In-app messages under the Preview in-app section. With this, you can ensure that GIFs and text display correctly on different devices and screen sizes. 

Step 2.3: Schedule and Goals
In the Send campaign section, define when you want to start and end your In-app messaging campaign. 
In the Conversion goals section, add conversion goals that you would like to track.
In the Campaign priority section, assign a priority to this campaign. For example, selecting Critical ensures that the users will always see the campaign even when there are other campaigns for which they are eligible. For more information, refer to Create In-App Campaign. 
In the Delivery controls section, define the controls based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create In-App Campaign. 
Click Publish.

After the In-app campaign is published, you can monitor its performance on the campaign analytics page. For more information, refer to Analyze In-App Campaigns.

Analyze and Optimize
Use the campaign analytics page to track user interactions with the In-app messages.
Gather feedback and identify any drop-off points.
Make necessary adjustments to the GIFs or message content based on user behaviour and feedback.

For more information, refer to Analyze In-app Campaigns.

Conclusion

Implementing an onboarding walkthrough using GIFs in In-app messaging can significantly enhance the user experience, making the onboarding process more engaging and effective. By following the steps outlined in this use case, you can ensure new users quickly understand and appreciate the value of the app, leading to higher engagement and retention rates."

How to Increase iOS App Push Opt-Ins
Introduction

Push reachability is a factor that impacts the impression and engagement numbers for all your campaigns. If you want your users to be notified of your excellent Push communications, they have to allow the same to be received by your app. We can nudge the users who have opted out of the Push channel, when they return to the app.

In this article, we will create an In-App campaign to nudge the users who have opted out of the Push channel, when they return to the app. These campaigns with push opt-in requests will be prioritized over the other automatically.

Expected Result

Users receive an In-app notification on their phones when they return to the app:

Step 1: Target users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign, or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Inbound, click In-app.

You are taken to the first step ""Target users"" of defining your campaign.

Campaign tags: Select the relevant campaign tags.
In the Target Platforms section, select iOS.

In the Trigger Criteria section, select On app open.

You can also select the trigger criteria to be On custom event. This option helps you to nudge the user when they are highly engaged with your app. For example, showing the pop-up when a user has done ""Order Confirmed"".
In the Select trigger time section, select Immediately to send the message immediately.
In the Target audience section, select Filter users by to specifically target only those users who have opted out of Push notifications on their iOS devices by selecting 'Reachability Push iOS is 202'.

Click Next to move to the second step ""Content"" where you can define the content that will go into your campaign.
Step 2: Content

MoEngage In-App campaign offers a variety of templates for all your use cases. It also provides the option to start from scratch.

Select the template that you want to show the user. We recommend using the Popup - Image, text, and 2 button template. You can customize it using the Template Settings page.
In the Buttons section, use the Actions tab to select the navigation of the user. You get two options here:
Request notification permission - If the user is eligible, this action triggers the iOS native notification permission. If the user has already declined the prompt, they will be directed to the application notification settings screen manually where they can manage notification permission.
Navigate to Notification Settings - This action takes the user to the application notification settings screen, where the user can manage notification permission.
Click Next to move to the third step ""Schedule and goals"" where you can define the schedule and goal of your campaign.
Step 3: Schedule and goals

Here you can select the campaign schedule, add the conversion goal, choose the priority of the campaign and define custom delivery controls.

In the Send campaign section, define when you want to start and end your In-App survey. 
In the Conversion goals section, add conversion goals that you like to track.
In the Campaign priority section, assign a priority to this campaign. Assigning a priority helps you decide which In-App message to be shown to a user when they are eligible for more than one messages at a specific time. For example, selecting Critical makes sure that the users will always see this even when there are other campaigns that they are eligible for.
In the Delivery controls section, define the controls based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create In-App Campaign. 
Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created an In-App campaign to nudge the users who have opted out of the Push channel, when they return to the app. These campaigns with push opt-in requests will be prioritized over the other automatically.

This automated campaign will help you boost your Push opt-in numbers resulting in an increased number of users eligible to receive your engaging communications. Make sure you understand the user behavior and reach out to them in an optimal way so that they do not go back to switching off the notifications permission.

Now that we have published the campaign, we can keep track of our CTR and conversions (if defined) to understand how well our campaign is performing. For more information, refer to In-App Campaign Analytics."

Profile Users Through In-app Surveys
Introduction

As a marketer, you may want to conduct a survey and profile your users based on the survey responses. Profiling users through surveys helps us understand our target audience, identify needs and preferences, and tailor products, services, and marketing efforts for better results.

Advantages of user profiling through surveys
Understanding user needs: Surveys allow businesses to directly gather information about user demographics, behaviors, preferences, interests, online behavior, and purchase history, which is crucial for understanding their needs and expectations.
Identifying areas for improvement: Surveys can uncover areas where users experience difficulties or dissatisfaction, allowing businesses to identify and address these issues.
Personalizing experiences: User profiling enables targeted messaging, personalized advertising, and remarketing strategies to create a more engaging and relevant experience for each user.
Enabling decision-making: The data collected through user surveys provides valuable insights into making data-driven decisions about marketing strategies.
Improving retention: Understanding why users unsubscribe or disengage from your campaigns helps improve customer retention, mitigate churn, and foster long-term relationships.

We will achieve this use case by creating an In-app Messaging campaign. We will conduct a survey for users who have unsubscribed from your newsletter and save the survey responses as user properties.

Expected Result

When users open the app, they receive a survey.

The responses they submit are stored as user properties. For instance, when a user submits an answer, the attribute associated with the answer is saved in the property survey_response. This information is then available in the MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED event within the user profile.

How to Boost Conversions with In-App Pop-ups

In the competitive landscape of fintech, engaging users and driving conversions are crucial for success. In-app pop-ups have emerged as a powerful tool to capture user attention, deliver personalized messages, and prompt desired actions. In this article, we will explore several key use cases where you can leverage in-app pop-ups to enhance user experiences and achieve higher conversion rates within your fintech app.

 

Account Notifications and Updates:

Harness the power of in-app pop-ups to deliver important account notifications and updates directly to your users. By displaying pop-ups for low account balances, transaction confirmations, upcoming bill payments, or account security information, you ensure that your users stay informed and engaged with their financial activities.

Example: Use an in-app pop-up to notify users about a pending bill payment that is due in two days, reminding them to make the payment to avoid late fees.

 

 

Promotions and Offers:

Utilize in-app pop-ups to promote special offers, discounts, or referral programs to your users. Create visually appealing pop-ups that highlight limited-time promotions, exclusive deals, or cashback offers. By enticing users with compelling pop-ups and clear calls to action, you can encourage them to take advantage of these benefits and increase conversions.

Example: Show an in-app pop-up promoting a limited-time offer of 0% annual percentage rate (APR) for balance transfers, encouraging users to consolidate their credit card debt.

 

 

Onboarding and Tutorials:

Smooth onboarding is essential for user satisfaction and retention. Leverage in-app pop-ups to guide new users through your app's features and functionalities. Provide step-by-step instructions, interactive tutorials, or tooltips within pop-ups to help users navigate your app seamlessly. By ensuring a user-friendly onboarding experience, you can reduce confusion and boost user engagement.

Example: Upon signup, provide an in-app pop-up with a quick tutorial on how to link a bank account, guiding users through the process step-by-step.

 

 

Personalized Recommendations:

Deliver tailored recommendations to your users through in-app pop-ups based on their preferences and financial behavior. Create pop-ups that suggest investment opportunities, savings strategies, or financial products aligned with users' goals, risk profiles, or spending patterns. By personalizing recommendations within pop-ups, you can enhance user engagement and drive conversions.

Example: Present an in-app pop-up recommending a high-yield savings account to a user who consistently saves a significant portion of their income.

 

 

Surveys and Feedback:

Gathering user feedback is vital for improving your services. In-app pop-ups provide an effective way to collect feedback and conduct surveys. Design pop-ups that invite users to participate in surveys or share feedback on specific features or recent experiences. By capturing valuable insights through in-app pop-ups, you can make data-driven decisions to enhance your offerings.

Example: After users complete a transaction, offer an in-app pop-up asking them to rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 5 stars and provide feedback on what could be improved.

 

 

Security and Fraud Alerts:

Maintaining the security of user accounts is paramount in fintech. Leverage in-app pop-ups to notify users about potential security threats, suspicious activities, or unrecognized login attempts. Deliver timely alerts, offer guidance on securing accounts, and reassure users that their financial information is safeguarded. By using pop-ups for security notifications, you instill trust and confidence in your users.

Example: Notify users of a potential security breach through an in-app pop-up, prompting them to review recent account activity and report any suspicious transactions.

 

 

Educational Content and News Updates:

In-app pop-ups serve as a valuable channel for delivering educational content and keeping users informed about financial news and market updates. Share informative articles, tips, or insights through pop-ups on topics such as budgeting, investing, or financial planning. By providing users with relevant and up-to-date information, you position yourself as a trusted source of financial knowledge.

Example: Share a pop-up with users, providing them with a quick summary and a link to an article about something in the financial industry.

 





Conclusion:

In-app pop-ups offer you a versatile and effective means of engaging users and driving conversions within your fintech app. By leveraging pop-ups for account notifications, promotions, onboarding, personalized recommendations, surveys, security alerts, and educational content, you can enhance user experiences, promote desired actions, and build lasting relationships. Embrace the potential of in-app pop-ups across these use cases to unlock the full power of your fintech app and achieve remarkable success in the competitive fintech landscape.

How to Trigger App Rating Pop-up for Champion Users
Introduction

App ratings provide valuable insights that help improve your app's key features. In this article, we will create a targeted campaign to collect feedback from your most active users regarding the add-to-cart experience. Champion users are defined as those who have added products to their cart at least 15 times within the past month. By focusing on these engaged users, we can gather meaningful feedback and identify opportunities for optimizing the shopping experience.

Expected Result

Collect actionable feedback from champion users in a non-intrusive way regarding their add-to-cart experience, leading to improved user satisfaction and potentially higher conversion rates.

Prerequisites

Integration of the MoEngage Android SDK or iOS SDK with your app. For more information, refer to the Developer Guide.

Create an In-App Campaign

In this section, let us create a targeted campaign to collect feedback from your most active users regarding the add-to-cart experience.

Step 1: Target users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign, or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Inbound, click In-app.

You are taken to the first step, ""Target users,"" of defining your campaign.
Enter the following details:
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, ""App-rating.""
Campaign tags: Select the relevant campaign tags.
In the Target Platforms section, select iOS.
In the Trigger Criteria section, select On Custom event. The trigger for the app rating request will be the action of adding a product to the cart.

In the Trigger the message section, select After Delay and configure the trigger to initiate the in-app message 1 second after the ""Add To Cart"" action.
In the Target audience section, select Filter users by to specifically target only those users who have added products to their cart at least 15 times in the last month.

Click Next to move to the second step, ""Content,"" where you can define the content that will go into your campaign.
Step 2: Content

MoEngage In-app campaign offers a variety of templates for all your use cases. It also provides the option to start from scratch.

Select the template you want to show the user. To design the pop-up, you can select any In-app message template. For this use case, we want to trigger this message non-intrusively, so we will choose the Nudge- Rating template. You can customize it on the Template Settings page.


Design an In-app message asking users to rate their add-to-cart experience.
Ensure the message is concise and user-friendly, with a clear call to action (for example, “Rate your add-to-cart experience”). You can see how I have created the pop-up here.

Add conditional actions:
You can also add conditional actions. For example, if the rating is less than 3, navigate the user to the support screen so that they can raise their query.

Click Next to move to the third step, ""Schedule and goals,"" where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 3: Schedule and goals

Here, you can select the campaign schedule, add the conversion goal, choose the campaign's priority, and define custom delivery controls.

In the Send campaign section, define when you want to start and end your In-app campaign with the frequency and limits.

For example, selecting Critical ensures that the users will always see this even when there are other campaigns for which they are eligible.
In the Delivery Controls section, define the controls based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create In-App Campaign. 
Click Publish.
Monitor the Campaign Performance

You can analyze the feedback from the ratings on the analytics page. Use it to identify trends and areas for improvement.


Conclusion

In this use case, we created an In-app campaign to collect feedback from your most active users regarding the add-to-cart experience.

This automated campaign will use app ratings to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the add-to-cart experience. This feedback loop allows continuous improvement, ensuring that the shopping experience meets the users' expectations and increases overall satisfaction.

Now that we have published the campaign, we can track its CTR and conversions (if defined) to understand how well it is performing. For more information, refer to In-App Campaign Analytics."

Display a Non-Intrusive Countdown Timer Banner
Introduction

As marketers, we use lightning deals, midnight deals, flash sales, product launches, event registrations, membership renewals, limited-time deals, and other time-bound offers to increase website/app traffic. Such campaigns often use countdown timers, which show how long they have to take action, to catch users' attention and create a fear of missing out (FOMO) emotion to nudge them towards purchasing.

Advantages of adding countdown timers in email campaigns
Boosting conversions: The visible ticking clock prompts immediate action, making subscribers more likely to click through and purchase during a limited-time offer.
Increasing website/app traffic: A countdown timer's visual element grabs attention and encourages interaction with the email.
Highlighting time-sensitive offers: Perfect for flash sales, limited edition products, or upcoming events where a deadline is crucial.
Creating scarcity: The perception of limited availability due to the countdown can motivate people to act faster.
Improving click-through rates: Countdown timers often lead to higher click-through rates on email campaigns.

We will achieve this use case by creating a non-intrusive banner at the top of the website that displays a countdown timer for a sale. We will use the On-site Messaging (OSM) feature of MoEngage.

Expected Result

Users will see a non-intrusive banner with a countdown timer at the top of the website, highlighting the remaining time for a sale. This will increase the sense of urgency and potentially boost sales during the promotional period.

Create an OSM Campaign

In this section, let's create an OSM campaign to show a non-intrusive banner at the top of the website.

Step 1: Target Users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left, click Engage > Campaigns, and click + Create campaign.
Under Inbound, click On-site.

You are taken to the first step, Target users, of defining your campaign.
Enter the following details:
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, Countdown Timer Banner.
Campaign tags: Select the relevant campaign tags.
In the Target platforms section, select Web.
In the Trigger criteria section, select On Page Load.
Set the trigger to display the countdown banner when a user visits the website.
Ensure the banner is shown after the user has been on the website for at least 5 seconds to avoid being too intrusive.


In the Select pages section, select All pages.

On the Target audience section, select All users to target all users who visit the website during the sale period.

Select the Exclude Users check box and define a condition to exclude users who have already made a purchase during the sale.

Click Next to move to the second step, Content, where you can define the content for your campaign.
Step 2: Content
In the Search templates field, search with the keyword “countdown” to find a list of pop-up windows.
In the Banner templates section, hover over the Banner: Countdown timer with button template and click Select Template.


Design the countdown timer banner in the desktop view as follows:

Add a title: Hurry up! Sale ends in.

Style: Use a bold and attractive font to grab attention.

Include a countdown timer: Display the remaining time for the sale. Ensure the timer counts down in real time.

Add a call-to-action (CTA) button: Shop Now

Link: Direct the button to the sale page.

Style: Make the button stand out with a vibrant color and clear font.

Design the pop-up in the mobile view: Reduce the text size of the elements and hide any element, if required.

Ensure the banner is non-intrusive: Position the banner at the top of the website so it does not cover any content or disrupt the user experience. Select the Push the content of the page down check box to ensure the banner is non-intrusive.

Click Next to move to the third step, Schedule and goals, where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 3: Scheduling and goals

Set up campaign scheduling and delivery controls:

Determine the duration for which the campaign will run, aligning with the sale period.

Configure the banner to be shown only once per session to avoid repetitive prompts and enhance user experience.

Configure the frequency and limits to ensure the message is shown appropriately.


After all the settings are verified, click Publish to launch the campaign.

User Interaction
Targeted users will visit the website during the sale period.
After 5 seconds, the non-intrusive banner with the countdown timer will appear at the top of the website.
Users can click the CTA button to explore the sale items or ignore the banner if they are uninterested.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a non-intrusive banner at the top of the website that displays a countdown timer for a sale. We used the OSM feature of MoEngage.

By implementing this countdown timer banner, users are subtly informed about the limited-time sale, creating a sense of urgency that encourages them to make a purchase before the sale ends. This approach helps to increase user engagement and boost sales during the promotional period."

Engage with Anonymous Users on Your Website
Introduction

Hundreds of anonymous users visit a website daily, especially in e-commerce, making it challenging for marketers to determine their exact intent. However, certain behaviors, such as returning to the site or repeatedly viewing specific products, can indicate high intent. We can view these users as highly interested and prioritize engaging them with relevant communication.

Since these users are anonymous (users who haven't created accounts or logged in to your website), outbound communication is challenging because we lack their email addresses or phone numbers. Therefore, we should use inbound communication strategies, such as On-site Messaging (OSM), to effectively engage with these users and encourage them to purchase products.

Advantages of engaging with anonymous users on your website
Target untapped potential: Anonymous users on your website represent a large, often untapped, audience that could become highly engaged customers. Some marketers overlook anonymous users, resulting in missed opportunities to build relationships and drive engagement.
Increased engagement: Brands that actively engage with anonymous users can significantly boost engagement and increase sales.
Improved conversion rates: Personalized experiences and targeted messaging for anonymous users can lead to higher conversion rates.
Enhanced retention: Building relationships with anonymous users can increase customer lifetime value and long-term retention.
Better utilization of marketing budget: By focusing on engaging anonymous users, you can potentially improve the efficiency of your marketing spend and achieve a better ROI.

We will achieve this use case by creating an OSM campaign to engage with anonymous users.

Expected Result

When users visit the website, they will see the following pop-up message.

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Your website must be integrated with the MoEngage Web SDK. For more information, refer to Web SDK.
Events to capture a user’s behavior must be available in MoEngage. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide. In this example, we will use the events Viewed Product and Purchase Completed.
The On-site Messaging channel must be configured.
Create an OSM Campaign

In this section, we will create an OSM campaign.

Step 1: Target Users
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.

Conclusion

In this use case, we created an OSM campaign to engage with anonymous users.

OSM is a powerful tool for reminding your users or sending an outbound message to help them proceed to the next step. If the user adds a product to the cart or makes a purchase, apart from increasing the LTV, they share contact information that can be used to engage with them through outbound communication."

Prerequisites

Integration of the MoEngage Web SDK with your website. For more information, refer to the Developer Guide.

Create an OSM Campaign

In this section, let us create an OSM campaign to collect contact details from your first time users.

Step 1: Target Users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign, or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Inbound, click On-site.

You are taken to the first step ""Target users"" of defining your campaign.
Enter the following details:
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, ""New User Retargetting"".
Campaign tags: Select the relevant campaign tags.
In the Target platforms section, select Web.
In the Trigger criteria section, select On Page Load because the aim is to show a pop-up when the user visits the website.
In the Select trigger time section, select Immediately because we want to show the pop-up as soon as the user visits the website.
In the Select pages section, select the All pages option.

In the Target Audience section, filter the users by User Property and define the attribute as ""Mobile Number (Standard) does not exist"".

Click Next to move to the second step ""Content"" where you can define the content that will go into your campaign.
Step 2: Content
In the Search templates field, search with the keyword “lead gen” to find a list of pop-up windows.
In the Popup templates section, hover your mouse on the Popup: Lead Gen 1 template and click Select Template.

After the screen loads, edit the template based on your requirement and define your campaign.
Click the + icon on the left to add new elements to your campaign.

As a part of your defining OSM, you can click the input box and click the first icon to get the following settings:

From here, you can implement basic level of checks. For example, selecting the “Tel” option from the first drop-down list helps MoEngage validate if users are entering only the numbers.
On the Advanced tab, you can make sure to save the input value to the profile that gets created at MoEngage by selecting the “Attribute” where you would like to store the input value. This will help you engage with them in the future.

To handle cases where the User Attribute Sync with segmentation is delayed, add the following Jinja to check whether the mobile number is populated.
{% if UserAttribute['Mobile Number (Standard)']|length != 0 %} MOE_NOT_SEND {% endif %}
Click Next to move to the third step ""Schedule and goals"" where you can define the schedule and goal of your campaign.
Step 3: Schedule and Goals
In the Send campaign section, define when you want to start and end your OSM campaign.

In the Conversion goals section, add conversion goals that you like to track.
In the Campaign priority section, assign a priority to this OSM campaign. Assigning a priority helps you decide which OSM to be shown to a user when they are eligible for more than one OSMs at a specific time. For example, selecting Critical makes sure that the users will always see this even when there are other campaigns that they are eligible for. For more information, refer to Create OSM Pro Campaign.
In the Global Delivery controls section, turn the Ignore global minimum delay toggle on to override the defined minimum delay between any two campaigns defined in settings.
In the Local Delivery controls section, define the controls based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create OSM Pro Campaign.

Click Publish.
Identify Users Who Submitted a Response
info	

Info

The user's inputs are stored in the user attribute mapped in the template. For example. if a user enters an mobile number and clicks Subscribe, the mobile number gets stored in the mobile number user attribute and is available in the MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED event in the user profile of the user, as shown in the image below.

You can identify users who have performed the MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED event and filter them based on their responses to create segments and analyze the data in them by performing the following steps:

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard -> Segment -> Create Segment.
In the Filter Users by tab, select User Property and add the Has executed event as MOE_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED.
Specify the time range for the event and add the campaign ID of your OSM campaign to see the number of users who have submitted a response to the campaign, as shown below:

You can create a campaign targeting this segment, analyze it or export its details, and run your own analysis on the segment data.
What Happens When the Customer Opens the Page?
The On-Site trigger will be called, from where the user’s mobile number attribute is checked by segmentation.
When the content is generated and sent to the SDK for rendering, the Jinja snippet verifies the user attribute again, and if the attribute does not exist, the content is sent to the SDK.
If the user attribute check fails in the Content section, the On-Site message will be dropped for the specific user.
To learn more, see OSM Pro Templates.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created an Onsite Campaign in MoEngage to generate website lead and retarget customers in real time.

You can also add other user attribute checks using Jinja or in the segmentation section and collect mobile numbers, emails, birthdays, or any other details that you would like to collect from the user."

Bring Users Back with Exit Intent Communications
Introduction

Detecting exit intent and engaging with your users one last time before they exit can go a long way in making them extend their session. Sending exit intent communications, like pop-up messages or banners, is crucial for boosting conversions before visitors leave your website. Using exit intent technology, you can send real-time communications to bring them back to the website. The following are some use cases we can achieve with this strategy:

Encourage users to extend their sessions of watching a series or listening to an audiobook.
Encourage users to complete their purchases when leaving the payment page.
Make users complete their KYC verification before leaving the documents upload page.
Advantages of bringing users back with exit intent communications
Reduce cart abandonment: Exit intent communications can help recapture sales by offering discounts, free shipping, or other incentives to encourage visitors to complete their purchase before leaving.
Increase conversions: By presenting a compelling offer or addressing hesitations, these messages can nudge visitors to take the desired action, whether it's making a purchase, subscribing to a newsletter, or downloading a resource.
Grow your email list: Exit intent pop-up messages can be used to capture contact details in exchange for valuable content or offers, helping you build your subscriber base.
Improve customer retention: By offering a positive experience and addressing potential issues, you can increase the likelihood that visitors will return to your website in the future.
Create scarcity: Highlighting limited-time offers or limited quantities can create a sense of urgency and encourage immediate action.

We will achieve this use case by creating an On-site Messaging (OSM) campaign to encourage users to complete their purchases when they try to exit from the payments page.

Increase Newsletter Subscriptions
Introduction

Newsletter-driven engagement is a common theme in increasing brand awareness across industries. Several brands send periodic newsletters to their subscribers to discuss their exciting updates and offers. However, it is often hard to get users to subscribe to these newsletters.

Advantages of increasing newsletter subscriptions
Building a loyal audience and community: A newsletter lets you directly engage with your audience, fostering a sense of community and loyalty.
Nurturing and generating leads: Newsletters can nurture leads by providing valuable content and informing subscribers about your brand and offerings. They can also be used to capture leads and convert them into paying customers.
Promoting products and services: Newsletters are a powerful tool for promoting products, services, and special offers, leading to increased sales and revenue.
Understanding audience preferences: Newsletter analytics can provide valuable insights into audience preferences, engagement levels, and content performance.
Staying relevant: A consistent newsletter keeps your brand on top of your audience's mind.

We will achieve this use case by creating an On-site Messaging (OSM) campaign to drive your newsletter subscriptions. We will use affinity segments to target users who read the sports section. If a user scrolls down 50% of the page on their next visit, a subscription pop-up window will appear.

Collect First-Party Data Using Typeform
Introduction

In today's digital landscape, where many web browsers block third-party cookies, collecting first-party data is more important than ever. First-party data is more accurate and relevant than other types of data because it's collected directly from your customers, prospects, and others who interact with your brand.

Advantages of collecting first-party data
Data accuracy and reliability: First-party data is accurate and reliable, unlike third-party data, which can be subject to inaccuracies or biases. It helps you build direct relationships with your customers.
Enhanced personalization: First-party data provides a rich understanding of individual customer profiles. This allows for highly targeted marketing messages, product recommendations, and personalized experiences. 
Improved customer engagement: By understanding customer preferences and behaviors, you can tailor their marketing efforts to resonate with specific audiences, increasing engagement and loyalty.
Better marketing ROI: Accurate and relevant data can help you optimize campaigns, reduce wasted expenses, and improve conversion rates.
Stronger customer relationships: Personalization and relevant interactions foster stronger relationships between businesses and their customers.

We will achieve this use case by creating an On-site Messaging (OSM) campaign and embedding the Typeform survey in it to gather first-party data on your website. Typeform enables you to create user-friendly surveys, while MoEngage ensures that the right audience sees your survey at the optimal time. We will survey the purchasing experience after the user buys a product from your online store. 

Expected Result

When users visit the website, they will see a pop-up message:

How to Encourage Anonymous Users to Log In to the Website
Introduction

Many app users interact anonymously without logging in, making it hard to understand their full intent. However, repeated app usage or specific interactions suggest high interest, making these users valuable for engagement.

Since they haven’t logged in, direct communication such as email or SMS isn’t possible. The best way to reach them is through On-site Messaging (OSM), displaying personalized prompts encouraging them to log in.

This article outlines how to create an OSM campaign targeting anonymous users, encouraging them to log in and explore the app's full benefits.

Expected Result

Anonymous users will see a pop-up with a personalized message when they visit the website, encouraging them to log in and engage with the app. This aims to increase user registration and engagement.

How to Show an OSM Highlighting the Benefits of a Plan and Offer a Discount for Upgrading
Introduction

A website hosts numerous users daily, many of whom may be using the platform's free plan. Identifying which of these users might be interested in upgrading can be challenging, but there are indicators, such as frequent visits and consistent activity on the site. Users who fall into this category present an opportunity for businesses to introduce targeted promotions that encourage them to explore premium options.

In this article, we will focus on users who are currently on the free plan and have been actively engaging with the website. Because they are already familiar with the platform, an On-site Messaging (OSM) campaign will highlight the advantages of upgrading to the premium plan. The OSM will also offer a limited-time discount to further incentivize them to make the switch.

In this article, we will walk through the process of creating an OSM campaign to drive conversions from free to premium users.

Expected Result

Users on the free plan will see a pop-up highlighting the benefits of the premium plan and offering a limited-time discount for upgrading. This aims to increase conversions and encourage users to upgrade to the premium plan.

How to Personalize Website User's Current Browsing Session
Introduction

Personalizing a visitor or user's current web browsing session is incredibly important. It allows businesses to deliver relevant content and experiences tailored to the individual's interests and needs.

How to Show Recently Viewed Products on Website
Introduction

In today's competitive landscape, the ability to recommend products or services precisely tailored to the customers' needs and preferences based on their current browsing behavior is a powerful tool. Displaying recently-viewed products on a website is important for numerous advantageous reasons:

Recollection: It helps users remember the products they have shown interest in. People may browse numerous items before making a purchasing decision, and may easily forget the products they previously viewed. A recently viewed section aids in jogging their memory.
Convenience: It saves customers time because they don't need to search the whole website again to find a product they were previously interested in. It makes the customer journey more convenient.
Personalized User Experience: Displaying recently-viewed products provides a personalized shopping experience. It shows that the platform is paying attention to the user's interests.
Increase in Sales: Products recently viewed, but not purchased immediately, can indicate a hesitance or indecision on the customer's part. Reminding them of their incomplete purchase may prompt a decision, leading to an increase in sales. This is often referred to as reducing 'view abandonment'.
Improved Customer Retention: By tailoring the shopping experience to user's tastes and preferences, businesses can boost customer satisfaction and increase the likelihood of return visits and customer loyalty.

In this article, we will see how you can achieve the same using the powerful combination of MoEngage Personalize and Recommendations.

Expected Result

Users will see the personalized recommendations with product grids based on what they viewed recently.

Common Use Cases
Use Case	Description	How to Achieve It?


Recently browsed or added to cart product grids

	By seeing products that have been browsed recently or added to the cart, the user feels that the website is aware of their interests, which can increase loyalty and lead to repeat visits and purchases.
Displaying recently browsed products is time-saving because the user does not have to search for the product again. This convenience leads to a positive user experience and can encourage customers to return to the website in the future.
It also reminds customers of products they were interested in and may have forgotten about.	

Create a Basic recommendations set corresponding to the appropriate User action and map this recommendation set at the time of placing the product page on the web page. This product grid can be placed on the homepage of your website for increased engagement.


Recommend similar products	By recommending similar products, users are presented with a wider selection of products that align with their interests. This can lead to increased engagement and click-through rates as customers explore and consider different products.	

Create a Smart AI recommendations set using our similar items algorithm and map this recommendation set at the time of placing the product page on the web page. This product grid can be placed on the product description pages of individual products.

 


Upsell or Cross-sell opportunities

	Recommending frequently bought or viewed products can be used for cross-selling and upselling, where a user is encouraged to purchase related or higher-end products that may be of interest to them.	

Create a Smart AI recommendations set using our Frequently Bought Together or Frequently Viewed Together algorithm and map this recommendation set at the time of placing the product page on the web page."

How to Rearrange Elements on a Webpage Using Personalize
Introduction

Rearranging elements on a website can play a significant role in personalizing the user experience (UX) by tailoring the layout and the content flow to better match the interests, behaviors, and preferences of the user. Here are several ways this enhances personalization:

Improved relevance: Prominent placement of content or products that align with users' interests encourages engagement, as users feel the site is more catered to their needs.
Increased convenience: Placing frequently used features or information where they are easily accessible caters to user behavior patterns, leading to a more intuitive and faster experience.
Behavioral data utilization: Based on a user's previous interactions with the site, rearranging elements can make the shopping experience feel more bespoke.
Enhanced discoverability: Websites can broaden the user's experience and encourage exploration by rearranging elements to showcase new or less visible content based on the user's profile or past behavior.
Adaptive content: Dynamically rearranging site elements to display content more relevant to the user’s current context (such as location, time of day, or current trends) can make the website feel more live and tailored.
A/B testing and optimization: Continual rearrangement based on A/B testing allows the site to evolve based on which layouts and content structures perform best for certain user segments.

By rearranging elements to suit individual user needs, websites can make their content more personally relevant and improve the user's efficiency and satisfaction, ultimately leading to higher engagement and conversion.

Expected Result

Visitors will see the personalized experience on the web page(s) whenever they fulfill the criteria specified as part of In-Session behavior.

How to Use Custom Notification Tone for My Android App
Introduction

In the realm of push notifications, the initial objective is to capture the user's attention. Android's Notification Channels enable app developers to categorize their notifications, allowing users to tailor the notifications to their preferences. Creating a notification channel permits the setting of specific visual and auditory features.You can achieve this with the use of custom sounds and other Android methods.

In this article, we will learn how to incorporate a custom notification tone for your Android app.

info	

Information

You need help of your Developer to achieve this.

Create a Notification Channel with Custom Auditory and Visual Settings

Perform the following steps:

Get a reference to the NotificationManager.
Before you can create a notification channel, you will need a reference to the NotificationManager:

Code
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	NotificationManager notificationManager = getSystemService(NotificationManager.class);
Create a notification channel.

Code
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	String channelId = ""my_channel_id"";

	CharSequence channelName = ""My Channel"";

	int importance = NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH; // Set the importance level

	NotificationChannel notificationChannel = new NotificationChannel(channelId, channelName, importance);
Set auditory properties.
You can set custom sounds and vibration patterns for:
Sound:

Code
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	// Define an audio attribute

	AudioAttributes audioAttributes = new AudioAttributes.Builder()

	.setContentType(AudioAttributes.CONTENT_TYPE_SONIFICATION)

	.setUsage(AudioAttributes.USAGE_NOTIFICATION)

	.build();

	// Set the custom sound and audio attributes to the notification channel

	notificationChannel.setSound(Uri.parse(ContentResolver.SCHEME_ANDROID_RESOURCE + ""//""

	+ getApplicationContext().getPackageName() + ""/"" + R.raw.your_sound_file), audioAttributes)
Vibration:

Codex
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	long[] vibrationPattern = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 400, 300, 200, 400}; // Define your custom pattern

	notificationChannel.setVibrationPattern(vibrationPattern);

	notificationChannel.enableVibration(true);
Set visual properties such as light color, lock screen visibility, and badges:

Code
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	notificationChannel.setLightColor(Color.RED); // Set the light color

	notificationChannel.enableLights(true); // Enable lights

	notificationChannel.setLockscreenVisibility(Notification.VISIBILITY_PRIVATE); // Set lock screen visibility

	notificationChannel.setShowBadge(true); // Enable badges
Register the Notification Channel with the system.
Create the notification channel through the createNotificationChannel() method:

Code
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	assert notificationManager != null;

	notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(notificationChannel);
Send a notification that shows up in the notification center.
Set the channel ID you specified earlier when building the notification:

Code
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	NotificationCompat.Builder builder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this, channelId)

	.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)

	.setContentTitle(""My notification"")

	.setContentText(""Hello World!"")

	.setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_HIGH); // Set the priority

	notificationManager.notify(1, builder.build());


info	

Information

The assert notificationManager != null; prevents a NullPointerException if the NotificationManager reference is null. Also, ensure that the entire notifying process runs in a background thread to not block the user interface.
Replace my_channel_id with a unique ID for your channel and My Channel must be the human-readable name of the channel. These settings will take effect when the channel is first created.
After you create a notification channel, you cannot change its behavior and the user has the final control over their notification preferences.
Use the Notification Channel in MoEngage
library_add_check	

Prerequisites

To use the Notification Channel, you must also update the MoEngage's Android SDK version to v8.0.00.

Navigate to step 2 ""Content"" of the Push notification.
In the Basic details section, add the notification channel:
Expand the Notification channel drop-down list and click + Manage notification channel.

The Manage android notification channel pop-up window is displayed.

Select the appropriate notification channel for your notification in the same section. After adding the channels, select any one of the channels for your campaign based on your requirement. All notifications posted to the same notification channel have the same behavior.

info	

Information

 

If an invalid channel ID is added or you miss adding one, MoEngage will use General Channel (a MoEngage Fallback Channel) to target your users on Android 8.0 (API level 26) and above.

Conclusion

In this use case, we learnt how to incorporate a custom notification tone for your Android app. You can test the behavior using the Test Campaign option before you publish the campaign. For more information, refer here."

Nudge Users Before Policy Renewal
Introduction

For any insurance-based company, policy renewal is an important metric for driving business. The closer users are to insurance expiry, the higher their intent for policy renewal. Nudging users before policy renewal helps ensure timely renewal, potentially increasing revenue and customer retention.

Advantages of nudging users before policy renewal
Increased renewal rates: Reminders and proactive engagement can significantly improve renewal rates, as users are reminded of the upcoming deadline and the benefits of continued coverage.
Revenue stability: By encouraging renewals, businesses can ensure a consistent income stream and avoid potential churn.
Customer retention: Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, and nudging users to renew strengthens the customer relationship.
Highlighting value: Nudges can be used to showcase the policy's benefits, address any concerns, and potentially offer upgrades or special offers, making the renewal process more appealing.
Improved customer experience: By providing timely reminders and personalized communication, businesses can enhance the customer experience and demonstrate their commitment to customer satisfaction.
Opportunity for upselling or cross-selling: Nudges can be used to suggest related products or services, potentially increasing revenue beyond the initial policy renewal.

We will achieve this use case by creating a Push campaign to remind users about their health policy renewal.

Expected Result

Users receive a push notification on their phones to renew their policy:

Recommend a Premium Card
Introduction

Promoting the benefits of new credit cards as a marketer brings several advantages. By emphasizing the financial flexibility, rewards, and incentives they offer, you nudge users to consider a new credit card for their purchases. By showcasing these benefits, you create a compelling reason for users to acquire a new credit card, providing them with enhanced financial options while benefiting your business through increased customer acquisition and engagement.

Advantages of recommending a premium card for a bank
Increased profitability: Premium cards typically come with higher annual fees, generating a steady stream of revenue. Affluent customers tend to spend more, leading to increased transaction fees for the bank.
Attracting and retaining customers: Premium cards serve as a powerful tool for attracting and retaining affluent clients, a highly desirable customer segment. These customers often hold multiple accounts and utilize various banking services, increasing overall profitability.
Enhanced brand image: Offering premium cards elevates the bank's brand image, positioning it as a provider of exclusive and high-quality financial services.
Increased customer loyalty and engagement: Premium cardholders often develop a strong relationship with the bank due to the exclusive perks and personalized service. This fosters customer loyalty and reduces churn.
Cross-selling opportunities: Premium cardholders are more likely to utilize other banking services, such as wealth management, investment products. This creates opportunities for cross-selling and increases the bank's share of wallet.
Increased card usage: Due to the rewards that are offered on the card, the card is often used very frequently by the customer, increasing the transactions that the bank processes.

We can achieve this use case using the following steps:

Create RFM segments
Create a Push campaign
Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phone to apply for a new credit card:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events must be available in MoEngage to track the action of a user spending on a credit card and related information such as the platform, bill amount, and card type. In this example, we will use the event Credit Card used. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.

An event must be available in MoEngage to track the action of a user opening the app. In this example, we will use the event App/Site Opened.

The Push channel must be configured. For more information, refer to Configure App Push.

User properties must be available in MoEngage to track the most common expense category (this is optional but can be used to personalize messages). In this example, we will use the property  CommonExpense.

Step 1: Create RFM Segments

Before creating our campaign, let's understand RFM segments and the process for creating them. We will use these to define our target audience.

The RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) model provides auto-segmentation and buckets users into categories such as Loyal, Promising, and At Risk based on their behavior. You can use these auto segments in different ways such as user analysis, churn analysis, and to target users effectively. To learn more about RFM Segments, refer to RFM Segments.

For our use case, let us use this model to find the Champion users who spend the most and recommend the premium card with the benefits to them, as they are our high-value customers who use our card the most.

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Segment > RFM segments. 
In the Recency Event list, select App/Site Opened, the event based on which the recency score should be allotted.
Use the same App/Site Opened event for Frequency Event as well.
In the Monetary Event list, select Credit Card used and select Revenue Attribute as Amount. 
Under Show analysis for, select All users to make the analysis run for all users.
In the Analysis Model list, select RFM.
Click Apply. This will generate a chart like the one below. You can click any chart to save it as a custom segment or create a campaign using the segment as the target audience directly. 
For our example, click the Champions box.
On the Engage Users dialog box, select Custom Segment.

Enter a name for the segment and click SAVE SEGMENT. 

Now that the segment to target is created, we can start creating our campaign to nudge people about the premium card.

Step 2: Create a Push Campaign

In this section, let us create a Push Notification campaign that triggers Push messages about the premium card:

Step 2.1: Target Users
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
On the All campaigns page, click + Create campaign.
Under Outbound, select Push > Periodic.

You are taken to the first step, Target users, of defining your campaign.
Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage. For example, Demo Account - E-commerce.
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, Premium Credit Card.
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

Under Target audience, select our saved custom segment created above by searching for the same. 
Under Target Platforms, select Android. 

Click Next to move to the second step, Content, where you can define the content for your Push campaign.
Step 2.2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For our example, select Basic notification. 
Enter the required content for the campaign. We can enter the content manually or generate it using Merlin AI. For more information, refer to Generate Push Messages with Merlin AI. 
You can also use locales to convey different benefits of the card that the users would like to know about. For example, using the user property CommonExpense which has the most common expenditure category, you can send different message to each category that the card has benefits on.
Essentially, you can define a message through this to convey to your users, who mostly spend on apparel, that the credit card has 5% cashback on Apparel expenses.
To do the same, click +Locale and then click +New Locale. 
On the Add new locale dialog box, enter a name to the locale and select the attribute that has this information from the drop-down list. In this example, select CommonExpense. 
Click Add to create the locale. Now search for the same again by clicking + Locale.
Select Apparel and then click Add. 
On the Choose content for new added locales pop-up window, decide whether to copy the content from the previously defined locale or from scratch. 
Similarly, you can create multiple locales for each category the card has benefits on, and one default generic locale for users.
The following is an example of how the content section might look after defining multiple locales based on your needs: 
Use the Deeplink section to take the user directly to the page from where they can apply for the new card to avoid drop-offs.
From the Default click action drop-down list, select Deeplinking.
In the URL field, enter the specific URL.
Click Next to move to the third step, Schedule and goals, where you can define the schedule and goal of your campaign.
Step 2.3: Schedule and Goals
In the Send campaign section, define when you want to start and end your Push campaign.

In the Conversion goals section, add conversion goals that you would like to track.
Define Delivery controls and Advanced settings based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create Push Campaigns.

Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we used RFM segments, locales, and Push Notification campaigns to recommend premium credit cards to high-value customers."

Highlight an EMI Option
Introduction

For a marketer, promoting the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) option for credit card spending offers numerous benefits. By highlighting this option, you increase customers' purchasing power and affordability because it allows for larger purchases and manageable monthly installments. Furthermore, it helps build trust, loyalty, and long-term customer relationships. However, transparent communication of associated terms and conditions is essential to ensure customer understanding and satisfaction.

Advantages of highlighting an EMI option
Increased affordability: EMI options make expensive items more accessible to a broader customer base by allowing them to pay for purchases in smaller, manageable installments over time.
Higher transaction value: Customers are more likely to opt for higher-value products when EMI is available, leading to increased average transaction values.
Enhanced convenience and flexibility: EMI allows customers to make purchases without paying the full amount upfront, enhancing their shopping experience and satisfaction.
Upselling and cross-selling opportunities: EMI can facilitate upselling and cross-selling opportunities, as customers may be more inclined to consider additional products or services when they are already in a purchase mindset.
Penetration of new customer segments: EMI can unlock new customers who might not have been able to afford a particular product or service without the installment option.
Faster inventory turnover: EMI can lead to quicker inventory turnover as customers can purchase items sooner and pay for them over time rather than waiting to save up for the full amount.

We will achieve this use case in two steps:

Create an RFM segment
Create a Push Campaign
Expected Result

Users receive a push notification on their phone to convert a purchase to an EMI option:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events must be available in MoEngage to track the action of a user spending on a credit card and related information such as accrued bill amount, and card type. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide. In this example, we will use the following events:
Credit Card used
App/Site Opened
The Push channel must be configured.
Step 1: Create an RFM Segment

Before creating our campaign, let's understand RFM segments and the process of creating them. We will use these RFM segments to define our target audience.

The RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) model provides auto-segmentation and buckets users into categories such as Loyal, Promising, and At Risk based on their behavior. You can use these auto segments in different ways, such as user analysis, churn analysis, and to target users effectively. For more information, refer to RFM Segments.

In this section, we will create an RFM segment to find the Champion Users who spend the most and introduce them to EMI or installment options.

On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Segment, and then click RFM segments.
On the RFM segments page, in the Recency Event list, select App/Site Opened, the event based on which recency score should be allotted.
Select the Use the same event as Recency check box.
In the Monetary Event list, select Credit Card used, and in the Revenue Attribute list, select Amount.
Under Show analysis for, select All users.

Under Show analysis for, select All users to make the analysis run for all users.
From the Analysis Model, select RFM and define the Date Range.
Click Apply.

MoEngage generates a chart like the one shown below: 
You can select any chart to save it as a custom segment or create a campaign using the segment as the target audience directly.
For our example, click the Champions box.
On the Engage Users dialog box, select Custom Segment and enter the custom segment name as RFM-segment.
Click SAVE SEGMENT.


Now that the segment to target is created, we can start creating our Campaign to nudge people toward the possibility of an EMI option.

Step 2: Create a Push Campaign

In this section, we will create a Push campaign that triggers push notifications about the possibility of having an EMI option. They will nudge users to convert their credit card spending to easy EMI options.

Step 2.1: Target Users
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
On the All campaigns page, click + Create campaign.
Under Outbound, click Push > Event Triggered.

You are taken to the first step, Target users, of defining your campaign.
Define your campaign with a name and tags. Enter the following details:

Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage.
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, EMI Option.
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

In the Trigger Criteria section, define the logic for identifying all customers who have used credit cards with an amount greater than 5000.
To define the above-mentioned dynamics, perform the following steps:
In the IF user section, select the event Credit Card used.
Click + Attribute to apply an additional filter to check if the Amount spent is greater than 5000.
In the THEN trigger the message section, select Immediately. Given the announcement is about EMI, suggesting the same for lesser amounts will not be meaningful. So, for this example, the target audience can be as shown below: 
In the Target audience section, select our saved custom segment, RFM-segment that we created in the Step 1: Create an RFM segment by searching for the same. 
In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step, Content, where you can define the content for your Push campaign.
Step 2.2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For example, select Basic notification.

Enter the required content for the campaign. We can manually enter a title, message, and summary, or generate them using Merlin AI. For more information, refer to Generate Push Messages with Merlin AI.

The content for such communications would need to have the values picked from the business event’s attributes, which can be done similarly to any other personalization.
Add personalization to the message using information such as the user's name. Such personalization makes the message more contextual and makes the users feel connected. To do the same:
Type @.
On the Push Personalization dialog box, find relevant attributes from a user's business event or user property. For example, here we have selected Credit Card Transaction Amount.

The following is an example of the personalized content screen:

Use the deep link option to direct users to a page in your app or website where they can check their ticket details.

In the Default click action list, select Deeplinking.
In the URL field, mention the relevant URL.
Click Next to move to the third step, Schedule and goals, where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 2.3: Schedule and Goals
Define when to start and end this campaign and the conversion goal based on your requirements.
Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create Push Campaigns.

Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this article, we used an RFM segmentation and a Push campaign to nudge users to convert their credit card spending to easy EMI options."

Inform Users About New Charging Station for EVs
Introduction

As electric vehicles (EVs) continue to revolutionize the transportation sector, the need for accessible and reliable charging infrastructure becomes increasingly vital. As a marketer responsible for promoting your company's new charging EV stations, you want to ensure maximum visibility and user engagement. Informing users about a new EV charging station is crucial because it helps alleviate ""range anxiety"" by making EV drivers aware of readily available charging options.

By leveraging MoEngage platform's capabilities, you can seamlessly announce and promote your new charging stations to users when they are nearby, ultimately driving awareness, fostering convenience, and building brand loyalty.

Advantages of informing users about new EV charging stations
Increased EV adoption: By knowing where charging stations are located, potential EV buyers are more likely to feel confident about switching to an electric vehicle, as they can easily access charging when needed.
Convenience for existing EV owners: New charging stations located in convenient areas, like workplaces, shopping centers, or along common travel routes, make charging easier for EV drivers. They travel further distances without worrying about running out of power.
Promoting sustainability: By making EV charging more accessible, you encourage the use of cleaner transportation options, contributing to environmental benefits.
Economic benefits: Businesses installing charging stations can attract new customers looking for convenient charging options.
Better infrastructure: Investors and businesses are waiting for enough EVs to be on the road to make the charging infrastructure business profitable. Informing users about new charging stations helps to address this problem by increasing EV adoption and making the charging infrastructure more attractive to investors.

We will achieve this use case by creating a location-triggered Push campaign to inform users about new EV stations when they enter a defined location.

Expected Result

Users receive a push notification on their phones when they enter a defined location:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Your platforms must be integrated with the MoEngage Android or iOS SDK. For more information, refer to the Developer Guide.
An event must be available in MoEngage to track the action of a user adding a product to the cart and related information, such as the platform, product name, category, brand, and price. In this example, we will use the event Added to Cart. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
The Push channel must be configured.
Create a Push Campaign

In this section, we will create a Push campaign to inform users about new EV stations when they enter a defined location:

Step 1: Target Users
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
On the All campaigns page, click + Create campaign.
Under Outbound, click Push > Location Triggered.

You are taken to the first step, Target users, of defining your campaign.
Define your campaign with a name and tags. Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage. For example, Usecases.
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, New EV station Announcement.
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

Define your geofence. While defining this, you can decide whether you want to show a notification when a user enters, exits, or stays in this region for a defined time (this is only possible with Android).
In the Geofence section, click + Add Geofence.

On the Add Geofence page, in the Geofence name field, enter a name for the geofence. For example, ChargingStation@DisneylandPark.
In the Send notification when list, select when you want to show the communication. For this example, select User enters the Geofence.
In the Notification responsiveness list, define your responsiveness as 5 Minutes. This is essentially the frequency at which MoEngage checks whether the user has entered the defined region.

In the Search for a place box, search for the location of your store. For this example, select Disneyland Park, Anaheim, CA, USA.
Define the radius below the map.

Click Done to add the geofence. This adds the fence, and you can check it from the Geofence section where you initially saw the + Add Geofence button.

If you want to add more than one fence, click + Add Geofence again and repeat the abovementioned process. If you want to edit something about the fence, click the edit icon and make the required changes.

In the Target audience section, click Filter users by, and then click the User behavior tab.

Send Flight Status Updates
Introduction

Sending flight status updates is crucial because it lets passengers stay informed about any changes to their flight schedule, such as delays or cancellations, or gate changes. By providing timely updates, airline businesses can also manage passenger expectations and maintain operational efficiency. This improves customer experience, brand reputation, and reliability.

Advantages of sending flight status updates
For passengers:

Improved travel planning: Knowing the status of their flight allows passengers to adjust their plans and avoid unnecessary stress or inconvenience, especially if they have connecting flights or other arrangements.
Real-time updates: Flight status updates provide passengers with timely information about changes to their flight schedule, enabling them to make informed decisions and take appropriate action.
Reduced anxiety: By staying informed, passengers can reduce anxiety and uncertainty associated with potential flight disruptions.
For airlines and travel companies:

Enhanced customer service: Providing timely and accurate flight status updates demonstrates a commitment to customer service and helps build trust and loyalty.
Operational efficiency: Airlines can use flight status updates to manage their operations more efficiently, such as adjusting staffing levels or coordinating with ground crews.
Reduced disputes: By proactively communicating changes to passengers, airlines can reduce the likelihood of disputes and complaints.

We will achieve this use case in three steps:

Create a business event
Create a Push campaign
Trigger the campaign by triggering the business event
library_add_check	

Prerequisites

An enterprise plan with the Business Events feature must be enabled for your account.
Events must be available in MoEngage to track the action of a user booking flights and other related information such as the platform, flight name, departure date, price, departure city, and destination city. In this example, we will use the event Booking Flight Successful. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
The Push channel must be configured.
Expected Result

Users receive a push notification on their phones with their flight status update:

Step 1: Create the Business Event

In this section, we will create a Business Event for your account. We can use the MoEngage Business Event public API. For our example, the following information is a part of the Business Event:

Event name: Flight_Status_Updates
Attributes of the event and their data type:
Flight Name: string
Departure Time: date
Gate Number: string
Departure City: string
Destination City: string

Perform the following steps:

Write the information above in the JSON format and send it to MoEngage through Postman:

JSON
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	      {

	    ""event_name"": ""Flight_Status_Updates"",

	    ""event_attributes"": [

	    {

	    ""attribute_name"": ""Flight Name"",

	    ""attribute_data_type"": ""string""

	    },

	    {

	    ""attribute_name"": ""Departure Time"",

	    ""attribute_data_type"": ""date""

	    },

	    {

	    ""attribute_name"": ""Gate Number"",

	    ""attribute_data_type"": ""string""

	    },

	    {

	    ""attribute_name"": ""Departure City"",

	    ""attribute_data_type"": ""string""

	    },

	    {

	    ""attribute_name"": ""Destination City"",

	    ""attribute_data_type"": ""string""

	    }

	    ],

	    ""created_by"": ""example@moengage.com""

	    }
Use the information above in the JSON format and make the API call with authorization information for the right data center your workspace belongs to. For more information, refer to Create Business Event API.
After the API call is made and the event is created successfully, MoEngage sends the following response:

JSON
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	     {

	      ""message"": ""The business event has been created"",

	      ""_id"": ""{{Business Event ID}}""

	      }
To verify if the event is successfully added:
In the MoEngage dashboard, go to any Business Event Triggered campaign.
In the Select business event list, you can check for your event. You can see the Flight_Status_Updates event.

Step 2: Create a Push Campaign

In this section, we will create a business event-triggered Push campaign to inform our users who are traveling today about the gate number and remind them to arrive 2 hours before the scheduled departure.

Step 2.1: Target Users
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
On the All campaigns page, click + Create campaign.
Under Outbound, click Push > Business Event Triggered.

You are taken to the first step, Target users, of defining your campaign.
Define your campaign with a name and tags. Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage. 
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, Flight Updates.
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.
In the Select business event drop-down list, select the Flight_Status_Updates event.

In the Target audience section, define users who are related to the Business Event that would be generated alone. So, for this example, the target audience can be as shown below:

We are trying to query for the list of users who have booked a flight in the last 60 days, with their Travel Date equal to Departure Time (coming through the Business Event) and their Booked Flight name equal to Flight Name (coming through the Business Event).
In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step, Content, where you can define the content for your Push campaign.
Step 2.2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For example, select Basic notification.

Enter the required content for the campaign. We can manually enter a title, message, and summary or generate it using Merlin AI. For more information, refer to Generate Push Messages with Merlin AI.

Add personalization to the message using information such as the user's name. Such personalization makes the message more contextual and makes the users feel connected. To do the same:
Type @.
On the Push Personalization dialog box, find relevant attributes from a user's business event or user property.


Use the deep link option to direct users to a page in your App or website where they can check their ticket details.

In the Default click action list, select Deeplinking.

In the URL field, mention the relevant URL.

Click Next to move to the third step, Schedule and goals, where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 2.3: Schedule and Goals
Define when to start and end this campaign and the conversion goal based on your requirements.
Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create Push Campaigns.

Click Publish.
Step 3: Trigger the Campaign by Triggering the Business Event

We are now ready to start triggering the communications. When an update on their flight status is detected, the campaign can be triggered using the Trigger Business Event trigger. The logic of when to pass this event to MoEngage lies at your end based on the business requirement.

Here is a payload example:

JSON
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{

	""event_name"": ""Flight_Status_Updates"",

	""event_attributes"": {

	""Flight Name"": ""XYZ"",

	""Departure Time"": ""{{Departure Time}}"",""Gate Number"": ""{{Gate Number}}"",

	""Departure City"": {{Departure City Name}},""Destination City"":{{Destination City Name}},

	""triggered_by"": ""john.doe@example.com""

	}
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a Business Event Triggered Push campaign to inform users who have a trip today about the gate number and remind them to come 2 hours before the scheduled departure.

Now that we have published the campaign, we can test it using MoEngage APIs. For more information, refer to Business Event Triggered Campaigns."

Message Users When They Enter a Location
Introduction

As marketers, we want to leverage location-based communication (often called geofencing) to engage users effectively and drive desired actions. By targeting users within a specific radius of our store, we can encourage them to visit and explore products from their wishlist or cart, or inform them about exclusive in-store deals. Similarly, travel and hospitality applications can nudge users with relevant offers when they enter a new city, such as booking nearby hotels, cab services, or tour packages.

Advantages of location-based communication
Increased relevance and engagement: By delivering messages and offers based on a person's location, campaigns become more relevant and engaging, leading to higher click-through rates and conversions.
Targeted marketing: Location data allows businesses to reach the right people at the right time and place, maximizing the impact of marketing efforts and reducing wasted spend.
Boosted in-store traffic: Location-based campaigns can encourage customers to visit nearby stores or attend local events, increasing foot traffic and sales.
Personalized experiences: By understanding a customer's location, businesses can personalize their marketing messages and offers, creating a more tailored and engaging experience.
Improved customer retention: Location-based campaigns can help businesses stay top-of-mind with customers and encourage repeat business by providing relevant offers and information based on their location.

We will achieve this use case by creating a Push campaign to send offers to users when they are within 5 km of your store.

Expected Result

Users receive a push notification on their phones when they enter a defined location:

Drive Users to Try Out Products at Store
Introduction

Though online shopping is popular, some customers still want to see, touch, and try them before making a purchase. As marketers, we can engage such users by nudging them when they are near our store. This approach aims to enhance the shopping experience and increase user satisfaction. We can trigger location-based communication to users if they enter or exit a certain area or when they stay at a certain place for a defined time period.

Advantages of driving users to try out products at the store
Direct sensory experience: Users can physically interact with the product, feeling the texture, weight, and fit, which is crucial for items like clothing, shoes, or electronics.
Visual assessment: Users can see the product's design, color, and quality in person, which is often more accurate than relying solely on online images.
Immediate feedback: Users can try the product in a real-world scenario, such as trying on clothes in a dressing room or testing a piece of electronics in a store setting.
Reduced risk of returns: By testing the product beforehand, users can minimize the chances of making an unsatisfactory purchase and having to return the item.
Inspiration and discovery: Store environments often feature a wide variety of products, allowing you to discover new items or brands that users might not have considered otherwise.
Customer service and advice: Store staff can provide expert advice and answer questions, helping users choose the right product for their needs.

We will achieve this use case by creating a Push campaign to nudge users to try out products at a physical store when they are within 1 km of our store. We will segment customers who have added products to the cart but have not purchased them yet.

Expected Result

Users receive a push notification on their phones about trying out products at the nearby store:

Prerequisites

Your platforms must be integrated with the MoEngage Android or iOS SDK. For more information, refer to the Developer Guide.
Events must be available in MoEngage to track the action of a user adding an item to their cart, purchasing the product, and related information such as the platform, added product’s ID, purchased product’s ID, name, and price. In this example, we will name the events Added to Cart and product purchased, respectively. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Geofence must be integrated into your account.
The Push channel must be configured.
Create a Push Campaign

In this section, we will create a Push campaign that triggers messages while a user enters defined regions:

Step 1: Target Users
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
On the All campaigns page, click + Create campaign.
Under Outbound, click Push > Location Triggered.

You are taken to the first step, Target users, of defining your campaign.
Define your campaign with a name and tags. Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage. 
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, Try out your dress!
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

Define your Geofence. While defining this, you can decide whether you want to show a message when a user enters, exits, or stays in this region for a defined time (this is only possible with Android).
In the Geofence section, click + Add Geofence.

On the Add Geofence page, in the Geofence name field, enter a name for the Geofence, for example, Disneyland_Park.
In the Send notification when list, select when you want to show the communication. For this example, select User enters the Geofence.
In the Notification responsiveness (only android) list, define your responsiveness as 5 minutes. This essentially is a frequency at which MoEngage checks if the user has entered the defined region or not.

In the Search for a place search bar, search for the location of your store. For this example, select Disneyland Park, Anaheim, CA, USA.
Define the radius below the map.

Click Done to add the Geofence. This adds the fence, and you can check it from the Geofence section where you initially saw the + Add Geofence button.

If you want to add more than one fence, click + Add Geofence again and repeat the abovementioned process. If you want to edit something about the fence, click the edit icon and make the required changes.

In the Target audience section, click Filter users by, and then click the User behavior tab.
Select the condition Has Executed and then select the Added to Cart event in the last 30 days time, as shown below:

Click + Nested Filter, select inner condition AND. Select the condition Has Not Executed and then select the Product Purchased event in the last 30 days, as shown below:

In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step, Content, where you can define the content for your Push campaign.
Step 2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For example, select Basic notification.

Enter the required content for the campaign. We can manually enter the content or generate it using Merlin AI. For more information, refer to Generate Push Messages with Merlin AI.

You can personalize the content further by entering information such as the URL, adding buttons, and/or adding coupons from the Advanced section.
Add personalization to the message using information such as the name of the user. Such personalization makes the message more contextual and makes the users feel connected. To do the same:
Type @.
On the Push Personalization dialog box, find your user attributes, such as Email, Google Advertising ID (Android), and first name.

Clicking the first name makes the message content look something as follows:

Not all users can find your store from where they are. So you can do one of the following:
Add the link to your store from the deeplink option:
From the Default click action drop-down list, select Deeplinking.
In the URL field, enter the link to your store.

Add an action button to link to your store:
Expand the Buttons section and click + Action button.

In the Button name field, enter a name for the button. For example, Take me there.
In the Click action list, select Deeplinking.
In the URL field, enter the link to your store.

Click Next to move to the third step, Schedule and goals, where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 3: Schedule and Goals

Location-triggered campaigns are always published as soon as possible. However, you can control when the message is shown based on certain time rules.

In the Time bound for Geofences section, select the Limited period option.
Click + Another time bound to add more rules.

In the Conversion goals section, add goals that you would like to track.
Define Delivery controls and Advanced settings based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create Push Campaigns.

Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a Push campaign to get users to try your product in your offline store if they added it to the cart but have not purchased it yet. To maximize conversions, you can set up a cart abandonment campaign in parallel."

Send a Card Payment Reminder
Introduction

Banks send card payment reminders to prompt customers to pay their credit card bills before the due date. Failed payments or late fees might jeopardize the bank's relationship with users or even lead to churn. Consistent reminders about upcoming bills can prevent unfortunate scenarios of missed payments due to forgetfulness.

Advantages of sending card payment reminders
For customers:

Avoids missed payments: Reminders ensure customers are aware of upcoming due dates, preventing accidental late payments.
Prevents late fees: Timely payments avoid incurring costly late fees, which can be a significant financial burden.
Maintains credit scores: Missed or late payments can negatively impact credit scores, making it harder to secure loans or credit in the future.
Increased trust and satisfaction: Reminders demonstrate a commitment to customer service and can increase trust and satisfaction with the bank.
For businesses:

Improves cash flow: Timely payments ensure a steady revenue stream, allowing businesses to manage their finances effectively.
Reduces outstanding debts: Reminders help businesses collect payments on time, minimizing the risk of outstanding debts.
Enhances customer relationships: Proactive communication about payments can improve customer relationships and build trust.

We will achieve this use case by creating a Push campaign to remind users about pending credit card payments 5 days before the due date.

Expected Result

Users receive a push notification about their credit card payment on their phones:

Prerequisites

Events must be available in MoEngage to track the action of generating a bill for a user and related information such as the card ID, bill amount, credit card name, and due date. In this example, we will name the event Bill generated. Also, this event should be configured to occur before we send the reminder about the due date. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Events must be available in MoEngage to track the action of bill payment by a user and related information such as the card ID, bill amount, paid amount, credit card name, and due date. In this example, we will name the event Bill Paid. 
The Push channel must be configured.
The Linked Conditions feature must be enabled for your account.
Create a Push Campaign

In this section, we will create a Push campaign to remind users about their pending credit card payments.

Step 1: Target Users
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Engage, and then click Campaigns.
On the All campaigns page, click + Create campaign.
Under Outbound, click Push > Event Triggered.

You are taken to the first step, Target users, of defining your campaign.
Define your campaign with a name and tags. Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage.
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, Remind users about card payment.
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

In the Trigger Criteria section, define the trigger condition.
A user can have more than one credit card, and you must remind them specifically of the card that they have not yet paid after the bill was generated. Therefore, the check must be dynamic, not static. For a user with bills generated for cards 1 and 2, you must look for the purchase event with the attribute pointing to each card and send a reminder for the card that does not have a Bill Paid event. To achieve this, we must use Linked Conditions while defining the trigger condition.
To define the dynamic check mentioned above:
In the IF user section, select Bill generated and then click + Filter to add the additional check.
In the AND then section, select Has not executed from the first list and Bill Paid from the Select an event list.
Click + Attribute and select Card ID because it is a unique attribute that can help you identify the card.
Select the is operator because you want an exact match.
Change Constant Value to Event Attribute because this value will change with the user and the card, and so referring to the Bill generated event will make the check personalized for each possible situation of a user.
Select the Card ID attribute of the Bill generated event from the list of attributes. This can help you compare the card for which the Bill Paid event is coming.
In the THEN trigger the message section, define the With Delay option to send a reminder to the user 5 days before the due date. This is the maximum time the user will be evaluated to fulfill the conditions from when the first condition is met.
The Select condition section looks as follows now:

The selected attribute must be in the supported format for the abovementioned filter to work correctly. For more information, refer to Create an Event-Triggered Campaign.
In the Target audience section, select All users.
In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step, Content, where you can define the content for your Push campaign.
Step 2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For example, select Basic notification.

Enter the required title and a message for the campaign. We can enter the content manually or generate it using Merlin AI. For more information, refer to Generate Push Messages with Merlin AI.
Add personalization to the message using information such as the user's name, bill amount, or credit card name. Such personalization makes the message more contextual for users with multiple cards. To do the same:
Type @. 
On the Push Personalization dialog box, find your event attributes, such as bill amount, credit card name, or user attributes, such as name.

Click Done.
You can select the attributes based on your requirements. Selecting a name and other personalization makes the message content look something as follows:

Whenever MoEngage tries to send a message, it makes sure to check the name of the user, credit card name, and amount from the Bill generated event and replace those instead of {{UserAttribute['Name']}}, {{EventAttribute['Credit card name']}}, {{EventAttribute['amount']}} respectively.
Use the deep link option to take the users to the bill payment page in your app.
In the Default click action list, select Navigate to a screen.
In the Take user to a specific screen list, select the respective screen.

Click Next to move to the third step, Schedule and goals, where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 3: Schedule and Goals
Define when to start and end this campaign and the conversion goal based on your requirements.

Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create Push Campaigns.

Click Publish.

In this use case, we created a Push campaign to remind users about pending payments for their credit cards 5 days before the due date."

Sample A/B experiments for Push

Experimentation is the key to marketing. Marketers use A/B or Multivariate tests to test how small changes in campaigns can impact results in a big way. One can then plough back the learnings from one experiment into the next campaign and build on it.

A/B experiments are conducted to test one variable. Multivariate experiments can be done across multiple ‘variables’ and one can compare how one variation performs better for a given conversion goal. As customers will be served either of the variations, their engagement with each experience is measured and collected to be shown as analytics. If possible, you should use Control Group to create a baseline. You can go as low as 2-5% for your control group allocation.

You can start experimenting with your messages:

1. Emojis

Sample Hypothesis: Having an Emoji in a message gives better CTRs

Experiment: Use Emoji in Variation 1 and send a plain message in Variation 2

Measure: Compare CTRs of Variation 1 & Variation 2 . If CTRs of Variation 1 are better then there are high chances you have a valid hypothesis.

2. Personalization

Sample Hypothesis: Using the customer’s First Name or Full Name results in better CTRs

Experiment: Use First Name attribute-based personalization in Variation 1 and create a plain message in Variation 2

Measure: Compare CTRs of Variation 1 & Variation 2 . If CTRs of Variation 1 are better then there are high chances you have a valid hypothesis.

3. Action Buttons

Sample Hypothesis: Using action buttons allows results in higher click-throughs

Experiment: Use notification action in Variation 1 while using only the default notification click in Variation 2. Set the conversion goal as per what conversion event you want to track.

Measure: Compare CTR for Variation 1 & Variation 2 . If the CTR of Variation 1 is better than Variation 2, there are high chances you have a valid hypothesis.

4. Images

Sample Hypothesis: Using images in Android push notifications results in higher click-throughs

Experiment: Use an image in Variation 1 while do not use any image  in Variation 2

Measure: Compare CTRs of Variation 1 & Variation 2 . If CTRs of Variation 1 are better than that of Variation 2 then there are high chances you have a valid hypothesis.

5. Coupon Code

Sample Hypothesis: Sending Coupon Codes with push notifications result in higher conversions

Experiment: Create an experiment where Variation 1 is using the Coupon Code while Variation 2 is not using it.Set the conversion goal as per what conversion event you want to track.

Measure: Compare conversions of Variation 1 & Variation 2. If conversions of Variation 1 are better than 2, there are high chances you have a valid hypothesis.

6. Landing pages

Sample Hypothesis: Taking new customers to any deal page results in a higher conversion rate

Experiment: Create an experiment where Variation 1 is using the discount code of 10-15% OFF and taking the user to the Home page while Variation 2 does not serve any discount code but takes users to your deals page. 

Measure: Compare conversions of Variation 1 & Variation 2. If conversions of Variation 2 are better than 1, there are high chances you have a valid hypothesis.

You can similarly experiment:

- if using a custom sound gets you more user attention resulting in higher CTRs

- if using a carousel of images gets more clicks in comparison to a single image

Do let us know what else are you experimenting with."

How to Cross-Sell Study Material Packages to Students
Introduction

Upselling is the strategy of selling higher-value course packages to prospects or additional services that integrate into their chosen course. This encourages students to complete their qualifications, as they’ll have access to supplementary resources and a better quality educational experience overall. Cross-selling, on the other hand, involves suggesting additional courses that may complement the student's original course. For example, if a student has studied business administration, they might be interested in leadership and management courses.

In this article, we will learn how to upsell or cross-sell courses and study materials to students using MoEngage recommendations.

Expected Result

Timely nudges of new or different courses which is of the user’s interest would attract user’s attention to browse through the courses/ articles. They would browse more, educate themselves of the new course and indirectly, increase the chances of making a purchase.

How to Reduce Cart Abandonment on Shopify Stores
Introduction

Sending cart abandonment campaigns is a highly effective strategy for e-commerce marketers, primarily because these campaigns directly address potential sales that did not initially convert. Benefits of such campaigns include recovering lost sales, increasing conversion rates, gaining insights into customer behaviour, personalizing customer interactions, and enhancing customer loyalty. These strategies not only help optimize the checkout process but also play a significant role in boosting overall customer engagement and retention.

With the swift and seamless Shopify integration, you can effortlessly import catalog and user interaction data in just a few minutes. This enables you to initiate effective cart recovery campaigns right from the outset.

In this article, we will create a Push campaign to target users who have abandoned a product or multiple products in their cart. We will use MoEngage Recommendations to send a personalized message to these users and recommended a similar list of products to them. 

Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phones 30 minutes after the cart abandonment, having content personalized with the item they added to the cart but did not purchase.

For marketers, the ability to provide strategic and precise recommendations can significantly impact the effectiveness of their marketing efforts and contribute to the overall success of the business. The recommendations are based on the purchase history. Hence, the probability of the user liking the product would be higher, enhancing the user’s engagement with the App. Recommendations can serve as a tool for engagement, prompting customers to interact more with the brand, whether it’s through exploring new products, spending more time on a platform, or participating in loyalty programs.

For example, a quick-service restaurant (QSR) can send tailored content showcasing items based on the individual’s past purchases. It can also display new products that match their affinity to increase product discovery. Over time, this can increase the variety and checkout size of known user purchases, which encourages customer loyalty and increases revenue from returning customers.

In this article, we will create an AI recommendation to recommend menu items based on the user's purchase history.

Expected Result

In this case, marketers would analyse the user’s behaviour and, based on the user’s purchase history, send recommended menu items to the user. This would allow the user to try out new products that he might like based on the AI or machine learning (ML) algorithm of recommended items.

Create a Product Catalog

In this section, let us create a catalog with the following heading and content. You must have the following mandatory fields in the catalog:

Create a Recommendation

In this section, let us create a recommendation based on the user's actions.

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard and select Content > Recommendations from the left navigation. The Recommendations page is displayed. For more information, refer to Creating User Action Recommendations.
At the top right corner, click + Create recommendation. This will take you to the first step, ""Select recommendation model.""

Select the Recommended items model and click Next. It takes you to the second step ""Create recommendation."" Enter the following details:
Recommendation name: Enter a name for the recommendation.
Recommendation description: Enter a description for the recommendation. This description will help you understand the model's aim.
Catalog: Select the catalog on which the recommendation will be worked.
The model should be as follows:

Here, the recommendation model would work based on the AI/ML algorithms based on the user’s purchase history. Ideally, recommendation models consider all the events such as Product Viewed, Browsed, Add to Cart but in this case, we are filtering the products out based on the Product Purchased or Purchase History.
Click Create to save the changes and run the model. Its status will be Active on the Recommendations home page.

Now that we have created the recommendation, let us create a Push campaign and personalize it using Recommendations.

Create a Push Campaign

In this section, let us create a campaign.

Step 1: Target Users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Outbound, select Push > Periodic.

You are taken to the first step, ""Target users,"" of defining your campaign.
Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. 
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign.
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

In the Target Audience section, select All users.

In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step, ""Content,"" where you can define the content for your Push campaign. 
Step 2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For our example, select Basic notification.

In the Message title field, enter a title.
While defining the message, select the product set generated through the recommendation you defined. Enter “@” and search for the name of the recommendation that you built, in the Push Personalization pop-up.


 

 

Using recommendations, you can personalise the campaign—title, body, and landing page. For example, if the client wants three different communications, you can have three different communications with three different recommendations in each.

 

You can also put this in an Email in the same order.

 

 

Row 1 is Recommendations for Choice 1; Row 2 is Recommendations for Choice 2; and Row 3 is Recommendations for Choice 3. These recommendations will be filtered based on availability and size.

Click Next to move to the third step, ""Schedule and goals,"" where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 3: Schedule and Goals
In the Send campaign section, select when the campaign should be delivered to your users and the periodicity of delivery.
Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information about these settings, refer to Create Push Campaigns.

Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this article, we created an AI recommendation to recommend menu items based on the user's purchase history.

Recommendations are a key to increasing and improving the app's usage. These outbound recommendations not only nudge the users, but sending them at the right time with the right set of products also entices the user to try more and increase stickiness with the App."

How to Reduce Bounce Rates on Websites
Introduction

As a marketer, you may be wondering how to reduce the bounce rates of new users on your website. The key lies in personalization. By tailoring your website to fulfill the specific needs and preferences of individual users, you can create a more engaging and relevant experience.

If a user is coming to the website after performing a certain action (viewed a product, added a product to cart), they are more likely to drop-off from the website if they do not find relevant products on the home page.

In this article, we will use Recommendation and Web Personalization features of MoEngage to reduce bounce rates and maximize user engagement.

Expected Result

Users will see the personalized web page with recommended products.

How to Use Recommendations to Announce Price Drop
Introduction

The Price Drop Campaign aims to reach out to your users who have abandoned carts or have viewed something but have not purchased any product, and inform them about items that have dropped in price. This has shown a proven result of increasing the sales of our clients.

Having such campaigns will help businesses have the following benefits:

Increase revenue and conversions,
Provide users a personalized experience
Reactivate inactive users
Increase repetitive purchase behavior

In this article, we will create a Push Campaign to trigger recommendations when there is a price reduction in a product that the users have checked out but have not purchased the same.

Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phones, with recommendations of products whose price has reduced:





library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user checking out products, searching for products, adding items to a cart, product purchases, and each action’s related information such as the platform, bought product’s ID, name, price. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Mapping of the tracked events above to concerned MoEngage events. For information on mapping custom events to MoEngage events, refer here.
A catalog and a respective feed that has a sale price or discounted price column. Set the feed to refresh everyday so that the latest discount price information can be added. For more information on product catalogs and feeds, refer here.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Linked Condition feature enabled for your account.
Create a Recommendation

In this section, let us create a recommendation based on the user actions.

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard and select Content > Recommendations from the left navigation. The Recommendations page is displayed. For more information, refer to Creating User Action Recommendations.
At the top right corner, click + Create recommendation. It takes you to the first step ""Select recommendation model"".

Select the User Actions model and click Next. It takes you to the second step ""Create recommendation"". Enter the following details:
Recommendation name: Enter a name for the recommendation. For example, ""ProductsViewed_By_Users"". This will be the name through which you will refer the output of this recommendation model.
Recommendation description: Enter a description for the recommendation. This description will help you understand what the model is aimed at.
Catalog: Select the catalog on which the recommendation is going to be worked. In this example, select ""Demo - ECommerce"".

Under Filter recommendations by user actions, from the Items where user performed drop-down list, select ""Product Viewed in the last 7 Days OR added to Cart in the last 7 Days"" and exclude items that were purchased in the last 7 days.
Under Sort the filtered items, from the Order results by drop-down list, select ""Most recent"". 
Click Create to save the changes and run the model. The status of the same will be in the 'Active' state on the Recommendations home page. The Recommendation engine will share with us the set of products a user has viewed or added to a cart but not purchased in the last 7 days sorted by recency.

Now that we have created the recommendation, let us create a Push campaign to nudge people about the products that have a lower price from the time they have viewed it last.

Create a Push Campaign

In this section, let us create a Push campaign with recommendations of products whose price has reduced.

Step 1: Target Users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Outbound, select Push > Event Triggered.

You are taken to the first step ""Target users"" of defining your campaign.
Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage. For example, ""Journey"".
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, ""Price Drop Campaign"".
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

Under Trigger Criteria, define the criteria. Remember that for this use case, we must trigger the communication only if the user has not bought the same product that they added to the cart as the initial check before checking for a price drop. This means that we must define a dynamic check. For example, for a user who added Pants to the cart, we must look for a Purchase event with the attribute pointing to Pant. For a user who has added Shoes to the cart, we must look for the Purchase event with the attribute pointing to Shoes specifically.
So to achieve this dynamic nature, we must use Linked Conditions while defining the Trigger Condition. To learn more about Linked Conditions, click here.
To define the dynamic check mentioned above:
In the IF user section, select Added to Cart from the drop-down.
Click + Filter and in the AND then section, select Has not executed and Product Purchased options respectively from the two drop-downs.
Click + Attributes and select prod_ID.
Select the operator as ""is"" because we want an exact match and then change Constant value to Event attribute.
Select the attribute that can help us identify the product that was added to the cart from the list of attributes that the Added to Cart event has. In this example, the same will be prod_ID.
Under THEN trigger the message, select With Delay and define the delay based on the requirement. This will be the maximum time the user will be evaluated to fulfill the conditions from the time the first condition was fulfilled.
The Select Condition section will look like below:

In the Target Audience section, select All users.

In the Target Platforms section, select Android. You can select other platforms that you would like to target the users in.
Click Next to move to the second step ""Content"" where you can define the content that will go into your Push campaign.
Step 2: Content
Select the template that you like to go with. For our example, select Basic notification. 
Enter the required content for the campaign. We can enter the content manually or generate it using Merlin AI. For more information, refer to Generate Push Messages with Merlin AI.
While defining the message, select the product set that is generated through the recommendation that you defined. Enter “@” and search for “ProductViewed_By_Users”, the name of the recommendation that you built, in the Push Personalization pop-up. 
Click Done. The following JINJA code is inserted in the Message field: 
Edit the code to run a loop through each product and list down only if the added to cart item has a lesser price than the one that they have seen in the past. The final JINJA code looks as follows:

JINJA
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% if ProductSet.ProductViewed_By_Users%}

	{% for product in ProductSet.ProductViewed_By_Users%}

	{% if product.product_id == EventAttribute['product_id'] AND EventAttribute['price']< product.price%}

	Price for {{product.title}} has reduced further!

	{% else %}

	MOE_NOT_SEND

	{% endif %}

	{% endfor %}

	{% else %}

	MOE_NOT_SEND

	{% endif %}

In Line 3, “product.product_id” points to the current Product ID in our product set and “EventAttribute['product_id']” points to our trigger event’s product ID, that is, the ID of the product that they added and not purchased. Similarly, ""EventAttribute['price']” points to our trigger event’s price attribute and “product.price” points to a product’s price. This line does a comparison to check if the current product is the same one as the product user added and if its price is less than the product price that they saw. If Yes, Line 4 gets printed. In other cases, the message is not sent.
Also, if you notice Line 4, {{product.title}} points to the title of our product in the product set generated from our recommendation. For more information, refer to MoEngage Templating Language (JINJA).
Enter the following code to get the image of the selected product above:

JINJA
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% if ProductSet.ProductViewed_By_Users%}

	{% for product in ProductSet.ProductViewed_By_Users%}

	{% if product.product_id == EventAttribute['product_id'] AND EventAttribute['price']< product.price%}

	{{product.image_link}}

	{% else %}

	MOE_NOT_SEND

	{% endif %}

	{% endfor %}

	{% else %}

	MOE_NOT_SEND

	{% endif %}


Personalize the content further by entering information such the URL, adding buttons in the Buttons section, and/or adding coupons in the Advanced section.

How to Nudge Users to Continue Watching Content
Introduction

""Continue Watching"" is one of the most common section that we can find in any OTT website or app. This section helps intrigue users to complete the series or movies that they have started in the order of recency. Similarly, sending out communications conveying the same, can help us improve metrics such as watch time and engage the user in a smooth manner.

In the long run, communications like these help us retain our users and keep them hooked provided the suggestions are in the right order. Also, the engagement to these communications can help us predict the user behaviour on what they like to watch, when, and other related insights. Moreover, this helps us not just to remind the users, but also subtly conveys that the app understands the user. This provides better customer experience, which in return will increase their loyalty to the app.

The following are some use cases we can achieve with this strategy:

Recommending content a user has rated good and suggest them to re-watch it
Recommending content a user has marked watch later in the last 30 days and has not started watching it

In this article, we will create a Push campaign to recommend your users on what to watch next. Leveraging the Product Catalogue feature, we will take advantage of cross-channel messaging to nudge users about the content they have viewed but not completed.

Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phones, with recommendations to continue watching content:

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user searching for content, watching the content, adding a content to watch later, rating a content, completing the content and each action’s related information such as the genre, title, type, progress, rating, platform. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide. Note that the steps might differ based on the SDK being used.
Mapping of the tracked events above to concerned MoEngage events. Mapping these events helps us in understanding the action and thus running our recommendation models and querying models on top of it to create an expected output. For information on mapping custom events to MoEngage events, refer here. In this example, the custom event of starting a content will be mapped to ""Product Viewed"" and the custom event of completing a content will be mapped to ""Product Purchased"".
A catalog and a respective feed that has a list of available contents and all related information about the same from the name or title to the director, cast, and description to any awards that the title won in any category. Set the feed to refresh at a suitable interval so that the latest information can be maintained. For more information, refer to Catalogs.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.

From the Item where user performed drop-down list, select “Product Viewed”.
Select the Exclude checkbox.
From the Item where user performed drop-down list under Exclude, select “Product Purchased”.

This query provides the list of content that a user has started watching in the last 10 days but has not completed in the last 10 days.
In the Sort the filtered items section, from the Order results by drop-down list, select ""Most Recent"".
Click Create to save the changes and create the recommendation. The status of the same will be ""Active"" on the Recommendations page.
The Recommendation engine shares the set of content a has started but not completed in the last 10 days, sorted by the recency.

Now that the recommendation is created, let us create our Campaign to nudge people about the content that they have viewed but not completed.

Create a Push Campaign

In this section, let us create a campaign to recommend your users to continue watching OTT content:

Step 1: Target Users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Outbound, select Push > Periodic.

You are taken to the first step ""Target users"" of defining your campaign.
Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage. For example, ""UseCases"".
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, ""Continue Watching"".
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

In the Target Audience section, select All users.

In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step ""Content"" where you can define the content that will go into your Push campaign. 
Step 2: Content
Select the template that you like to go with. For our example, select Single Image Carousel.

In the Message title field, enter a title.
While defining the message, select the product set that is generated through the recommendation that you defined. Enter “@” and search for “OTT_ContinueWatching”, the name of the recommendation that you built, in the Push Personalization pop-up.

Click Done. The following JINJA code is inserted in the Message field:

Edit the code to run a loop through each content and list down the title of the first 5. The final JINJA code looks as follows:

JINJA
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	    {% if ProductSet.OTT_ContinueWatching%}

	    {% for product in ProductSet.OTT_ContinueWatching[0:5]%}

	    {{product.title }}

	    {%\n%}

	    {% endfor %}

	    {% else %}

	    MOE_NOT_SEND

	    {% endif %}
In line 3, {{product.title }} will have the title that we have passed in our Catalog for each one of the feed. The loop runs through the product lists provided by the recommendation. Because you selected to sort the list based on recency, you are only looping until first 5 here.
Enter the following code to get the image of the recommended watch:
In the Carousel Content section, add 5 images of the titles.
Select the Image URL option and enter the following JINJA code for each slide by changing the line 2 as explained below:
Here you can find the code for the Slide 1:

JINJA
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	    {% if ProductSet.OTT_ContinueWatching%}

	    {% for product in ProductSet.OTT_ContinueWatching[0:1]%}

	    {{product.image_link}}

	    {% endfor %}

	    {% else %}

	     MOE_NOT_SEND

	    {% endif %}
In line 2, you are defining the loop to go through just the first item and {{product.image_link}} in line 3 will provide the link to the image.
Similarly, for slide 2, the line 2 will change as {% for product in ProductSet.OTT_ContinueWatching[1:2]%} and so on.

Click Next to move to the third step ""Schedule and goals"" where you can define the schedule and goal of your campaign.
Step 3: Schedule and Goals
In the Send campaign section, select when the campaign should be delivered to your users and the periodicity of delivery
Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information about these settings, refer to Create Push Campaigns.

Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a Push campaign to recommend your users on what to watch next. Now that we have published the Campaign for our use case using Recommendations, we can check out other possibilities of MoEngage’s Recommendations."

How to Drive Upsells Through Recommendations
Introduction

Upselling related items is a great way to improve retention and customer lifetime value (CLV). There are several examples of high converting upsells across industries:

Screen protectors and covers after purchasing a phone
Meals and cab booking after purchasing a flight ticket
Extended warranty or installation after purchasing an electronic gadget
Add-on plans after purchasing an insurance policy

In this article, we will learn how to leverage MoEngage Recommendations to recommend the right product to upsell at the right time. We follow the steps below to achieve this use case:

Create a Recommendation with ""Similar items"" model.
Create a Flow with ""Product Purchased"" as the entry criteria.
Send a Push Notification with the recommended product.
Desired Result

The following is a Push Notification users receive on their phones, with recommendations of a related product:

library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user searching for products, adding a product to the cart or adding a product to wishlist, completing the purchase and each action’s related information such as the platform, product name, category, brand, price. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide. Note that the steps might differ based on the SDK being used.
Mapping of the above tracked events to the concerned MoEngage events. This mapping helps us in understanding the action and thus run our recommendation models and in querying models to create an expected output. For more information, refer to Map User Actions Settings. For our example, the custom event of searching for a product or viewing a product will be mapped to ""Product Viewed"" and the custom event of completing a purchase will be mapped to ""Product Purchased"".
A catalog and a respective feed that have a list of available products and all related information about the same such as the title, category, brand, and price. Set the feed to refresh at a suitable interval so that the latest information can be maintained. For more information, refer to Catalogs.
Settings for one or more than one channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Create a Recommendation

In this section, let us create a recommendation based on the users action.

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard and select Content > Recommendations from the left navigation. The Recommendations page is displayed. For more information, refer to Creating User Action Recommendations.
At the top right corner, click + Create recommendation. It takes you to the first step ""Select recommendation model"".

Under Predictive, click the Frequently bought together items card. This is suitable for our use case because this model considers the previous purchases of the user and takes the help of SHERPA AI to predict what other products would the same user prefer.
Click Next. It takes you to the second step ""Create recommendation"". Enter the following details:
Recommendation name: Enter a name for the recommendation. For example, ""BroughtTogetherItems"". This will be the name through which you will refer the output of this recommendation model.
Recommendation description: Enter a description for the recommendation. This description will help you understand what the model is aimed at.
Catalog: Select the catalog that has all the list of products offered by you with all the related information.

Select the action on which the recommendation model must generate suggestions. In our use case, select “Product Purchased” here because the event of a user watching a content is mapped to this MoEngage defined event. You can change or check the mapped user actions from the Map user action button in this section.

Click Create to save the changes and run the model.
Please note that this will take 24 hours. You can find the status of the model on the Recommendations home page.


The Recommendation engine shares the set of products a user might prefer based on their previous purchase.

Now that we created the recommendation, let us create our Flows to nudge people about related product.

Create a Flow

In this section, let us create a Flow to nudge your customers to recommend the right product to upsell at the right time.

Add Flow Details
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Flows and click + Create flow, or click + Create new, and then click Flow.
Click + Start with a blank canvas. You are taken to the first step “Details and goals”.
Enter the following flow details:

Flow Name: Enter a flow name. For example, ""Recommend Products"".
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Under the Conversion goal section, turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by doing the event ""Product Purchased"". This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user purchases a product.


Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user by mentioning the trigger conditions. For our example, the event can be “Product Purchased”.
In the IF user section, select the event “Product Purchased”, which gets triggered when a user purchases a product.

In the Flow Schedule section, define a start time and an end time to the flow if required. By default, the flow will start “As soon as possible” and will never end.
Turn the Limit user entry into this flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow. Defining such limits helps you control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience.

Click Next to move to the third step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you select the target audience and control groups for your Flow.
In the Audience section, select All users.

Click Next to move to the canvas section where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to move through.
Define Flow Structure
Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed from where you can choose an action campaign from the range of options under Actions including Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp to send a message. You can also display a banner on the On-site or In-app channel, or use Facebook or Google remarketing.

For this example, let us add a Push action and explain how to use the recommendation predicted by SHERPA of MoEngage in Flows.
Click Push to add a stage. Hover your mouse on the stage and click the edit icon to start defining the stage.

Enter the campaign name. For example, ""Recommend Product"".
Select the platforms you like to target. For this example, select Android alone.
Select a template as per your wish. For this example, select Basic notification.

Entering the required content. You can add a title or generate it using Merlin AI. For more information, refer to Generate Push Messages with Merlin AI.
While defining the message, select the product set that is generated through the recommendation that you defined. Enter “@” and search for “BroughtTogetherItems”, the name of the recommendation that you built, in the Push Personalization pop-up.

Click Done. The following JINJA code is inserted in the Message field:

Edit the code to run a loop through each product and list down the first suggestion because the highly confident suggestions come first from the Recommendation engine. The higher the confidence the topper the product will be in the list. The final JINJA code looks as follows:

JINJA
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% if ProductSet.BroughtTogetherItems%}

	{% for product in ProductSet.BroughtTogetherItems[0:1]%}

	{{product.product_name}} at {{product.price}}

	{% endfor %}

	{% else %}

	MOE_NOT_SEND

	{% endif %}
In line 2, the loop does only one iteration using the “[0:1]” part in the query. If you want to suggest top 3, you can change the same to “[0:3]” and so on. The {{product.product_name}} element in line 3 prints the name of the suggested product. For more information, refer to MoEngage Templating Language (JINJA).
Enter the following code to get the image of the product selected above:

JINJA
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% if ProductSet.BroughtTogetherItems%}

	{% for product in ProductSet.BroughtTogetherItems[0:1]%}

	{{product.image_link}}

	{% endfor %}

	{% else %}

	MOE_NOT_SEND

	{% endif %}
Add a deeplink to the PN by mentioning the URL that will directly take them to the mentioned product’s page or home screen of the app. This reduces the possibility of a user dropping off before finding the suggested content. For the former, the following is the JINJA code:

JINJA
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	{% if ProductSet.BroughtTogetherItems%}

	{% for product in ProductSet.BroughtTogetherItems[0:1]%}

	{{product.product_url}}

	{% endfor %}

	{% else %}

	MOE_NOT_SEND

	{% endif %}
If you have additional information about the users such as their name and gender, use the same to personalize the message while editing your action campaign. Also, including such details helps making the message more contextual and thereby increasing the chance of making the user feel connected and purchase the product. For more information, refer to Personalization in Flows.
Click Done to save your changes.
After defining an Action campaign, add a Has done event stage to check if the user has converted by choosing the ""Product Purchased"" event from the drop-down list or any other goal of yours.
Turn the Keep evaluating for the next toggle on to define the maximum time to wait for the user to execute the event. You can select any time limit that you deem fit.

Add as many action campaigns you want to nudge the user. Make sure to have some gap between any two communications to avoid spamming the user by using a Wait stage, especially in the Yes path of your “Has done events”. For more information, refer to Add Controls to Flow.

Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we leveraged MoEngage Recommendations to recommend the right product to upsell at the right time. We created a Flow with ""Product Purchased"" as the entry criteria and sent a Push Notification with the recommended product.

Now that we have published the campaign for our use case using Recommendations, we can check out other possibilities of MoEngage’s Recommendations."

How to Use Recommendations to Drive First Purchase
Introduction

In the evolving e-commerce landscape, personalization has emerged as a successful marketing strategy, effectively transforming the way we approach our customers. It is no longer just about recommending products to customers; it is about recommending the right products, based on individual user's browsing and purchasing behavior.

In this article, we will discuss how to recommend a product to users based on their actions. Actions include viewing a product, adding it to wishlist, adding it to cart, and other related information in the attributes such as the category, price, and so on. We follow the steps below to achieve this use case:

Create a Recommendation with ""Recommended items"" model.
Create a Flow with ""Product Viewed"" as the entry criteria.
Send a Push Notification with the recommended product.
Expected Result

Users receive a Push Notification on their phones, with recommendations of a product:

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user searching for products, adding a product to the cart or adding a product to wishlist, completing the purchase and each action’s related information such as the platform, product name, category, brand, price. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Mapping of the above tracked events to the concerned MoEngage events. For our example, the custom event of searching for a product or viewing a product will be mapped to ""Product Viewed"" and the custom event of completing a purchase will be mapped to ""Product Purchased"". For information on mapping custom events to MoEngage events, refer here.
A catalog and a respective feed that have a list of available products and all related information about the same such as the title, category, brand, and price. Set the feed to refresh at a suitable interval so that the latest information can be maintained. For more information on product catalogs and feeds, refer here.
Settings for one or more than one channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Create a Recommendation

In this section, let us create a recommendation based on the users action.

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard and select Content > Recommendations from the left navigation. The Recommendations page is displayed. For more information, refer to Creating User Action Recommendations.
At the top right corner, click + Create recommendation. It takes you to the first step ""Select recommendation model"".

Under Predictive, click the Recommended items card. This is suitable for our use case because this model considers the previous action that the user has done (such as viewing product, adding to wishlist, adding to cart, purchasing and other related information in the attributes such as the category, price, and so on) and takes the help of SHERPA AI to predict what other products would the same user prefer.
Click Next. It takes you to the second step ""Create recommendation"". Enter the following details:
Recommendation name: Enter a name for the recommendation. For example, ""Recommended Products"". This will be the name through which you will refer the output of this recommendation model.
Recommendation description: Enter a description for the recommendation. This description will help you understand what the model is aimed at.
Catalog: Select the catalog that has all the list of products offered by you with all the related information.

Click Create to save the changes and run the model.
Please note that this will take 24 hours. You can find the status of the model on the Recommendations home page:


The Recommendation engine shares the set of products a user might prefer based on their historical actions.

Now that we created the recommendation, let us create our Flow to nudge people about the product that they have viewed but not purchased.

Create a Flow

In this section, let us create a Flow to nudge your customers to recommend products to your users.

Add Flow Details
Navigate to Engage > Flows and click + Create Flow or navigate to the sidebar, click + Create new, and then click Flow.
Click + Start with a blank canvas to start building your flow for the use case. You are taken to the first step “Details and goals”. 
Enter the following details:

Flow name: Enter a name for the flow. For example, ""Recommend Products"".
Flow tags: Select the required flow tags.
Under the Conversion goal section, turn the Exit on conversion toggle on to exit users who convert by doing the event ""Product Purchased"". This is your primary conversion goal, which triggers when a user purchases a product.

Click Next to move the second step “When will users enter the flow”. This step helps you define when to allow the user by mentioning the trigger conditions. For our example, the event can be “Product Viewed”.
In the IF user section, select the event “Product Viewed”, which gets triggered when a user visits a product page or views it .

In the Flow Schedule section, define a start time and an end time to the flow if required. By default, the flow will start “As soon as possible” and will never end.
Turn the Limit user entry into this flow toggle on to define the maximum time a user can enter the flow.
Please note that the users are highly likely to match this Flow’s entry rules more often and thus might enter the flow too many times. Defining such limits helps you control users from re-entering the flow repeatedly and thus avoid spamming them too much, which in turn provides a better user experience.

Click Next to move to the third step “Who will enter the flow”. This is where you select the target audience and control groups for your Flow.
In the Audience section, select users who have not purchased in the last 30 days.

Click Next to move to the canvas section where you can define the Flow structure that you want the user to move through.
Define Flow Structure
Click the + icon. A drawer is displayed from where you can choose an action campaign from the range of options under Actions including Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp to send a message. You can also display a banner on the On-site or In-app channel, or use Facebook or Google remarketing.

How to Recommend Apparels by Size and Availability
Introduction

Many times, marketers recommend products that are out of stock or do not exist in the size requested. This creates a bad user experience, and the user might be skeptical while clicking the engagement communications.

A marketer needs to manage the recommendations regarding stock and size availability to create a better user experience.

In this article, we will create an AI recommendation to recommend clothes and shoes of the size the user has previously purchased and are currently in stock. 

Expected Result

Recommendations with correct stock and size availability would give users a better experience when they download the app and browse through the collections available there.

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user searching for products, adding a product to the cart or adding a product to the wishlist, completing the purchase, and each action’s related information such as the platform, product name, category, brand, and price. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Mapping of these tracked events to concerned MoEngage events. For information on mapping custom events to MoEngage events, refer to Map User Actions Settings.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Create a Product Catalog

In this section, let us create a catalog with the following heading and content. Note that we have considered the category name to be the primary key. Thus, the category name has to be unique.


Create a Recommendation

In this section, let us create a recommendation based on the user's actions.

Navigate to the MoEngage Dashboard and select Content > Recommendations from the left navigation. The Recommendations page is displayed. For more information, refer to Creating User Action Recommendations.
At the top right corner, click + Create recommendation. This will take you to the first step, ""Select recommendation model.""

Select the Recommended items model and click Next. It takes you to the second step ""Create recommendation"". Enter the following details:
Recommendation name: Enter a name for the recommendation.
Recommendation description: Enter a description for the recommendation. This description will help you understand the model's aim.
Catalog: Select the catalog on which the recommendation will be worked.
The model should be as follows:

Here, the recommendation model would work based on AI or machine learning (ML) algorithms. After you create recommendations, they will be filtered by availability and size. Generally, availability is numerical. Hence, the options we would get would be greater than, less than, and so on. So, the availability condition would ideally be greater than 0.
For size, we will analyze the client’s previous purchase. During the previous purchase, we need to capture the client’s size in a user attribute via SDK or S2S, depending on the client’s tech availability. The S2S method can be achieved using connectors. The connector campaign can be essentially an event-triggered campaign that would pass on the size from the event attribute to the user attribute via the User API.
In either method, a user attribute, Size, would be created, which would be used to filter the recommendations.
Click Create to save the changes and run the model. Its status will be Active on the Recommendations home page.

Now that we have created the recommendation, let us create a Push campaign and personalize it using Recommendations.

Create a Push Campaign

In this section, let us create a campaign.

Step 1: Target Users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Outbound, select Push > Periodic.

You are taken to the first step, ""Target users,"" of defining your campaign.
Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. 
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign.
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

In the Target Audience section, select All users.

In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step, ""Content,"" where you can define the content for your Push campaign. 
Step 2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For our example, select Basic notification.

In the Message title field, enter a title.
While defining the message, select the product set generated through the recommendation you defined. Enter “@” and search for the name of the recommendation that you built, in the Push Personalization pop-up.


 

 

Using recommendations, you can personalize the campaign—title, body, and landing page. For example, if the client wants three different communications, you can have three different communications with three different recommendations in each.

 

You can also put this in an Email in the same order.

 

 

Row 1 is Recommendations for Choice 1; Row 2 is Recommendations for Choice 2; and Row 3 is Recommendations for Choice 3. These recommendations will be filtered based on availability and size.

Click Next to move to the third step, ""Schedule and goals,"" where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 3: Schedule and Goals
In the Send campaign section, select when the campaign should be delivered to your users and the periodicity of delivery.
Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information about these settings, refer to Create Push Campaigns.

Click Publish.

Once the user clicks on the communication, they will be redirected to the browsing page to explore more products. More browsing can lead to an increased percentage of purchases.

Conclusion

In this article, we created an AI recommendation to recommend clothes and shoes of the size the user has previously purchased and are currently in stock. 

Recommendations are key to increasing and improving the app's usage. These outbound recommendations not only nudge the users, but sending them at the right time also entices them to try more recommendations/ products."

How to Recommend Content to Watch Next
Introduction

Showing content recommendations is an effective way for marketers of OTT platforms to increase users' screen time. There are two key steps involved in achieving this:

For each user, come up with content they are likely to watch (recommendations) based on their watch history.
Show these recommendations at the right place and time to the user.

MoEngage can help marketers accomplish both these steps through Recommendations and Campaigns. Push notifications, emails, cards, and on-site pop-up messages (OSM) on exit intent can be good ways to show such recommendations to the user.

In this article, we will:

Create a recommendation on what to watch next.
Send that recommendation through push notifications to your users.
Expected Result

Users receive a push notification with recommendations of what to watch next on their phones:

Click Create to save the changes and run the model.
Note that this will take 24 hours. You can find the status of the model on the Recommendations home page:

The Recommendation engine shares the set of content a user might prefer based on the list of content they watched in the last 10 days.

Now that we have created the recommendation, let us create a Push campaign to nudge people about the content that they have viewed but not completed.

Create a Push Campaign

In this section, let us create a Push campaign to recommend what to watch next to your users.

Step 1: Target Users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Outbound, select Push > Periodic.

You are taken to the first step, ""Target users,"" of defining your campaign.
Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. For more information, refer to Teams in MoEngage.
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign. For example, ""WhatNextToWatch.""
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

In the Target Audience section, select users who have not watched content in the last 1 day.

In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step, ""Content,"" where you can define the content for your Push campaign.
Step 2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For our example, select Basic notification.

Enter the required content for the campaign. We can manually enter a title, message, and summary or generate it using Merlin AI. For more information, refer to Generate Push Messages with Merlin AI. 
While defining the message, select the product set generated through the recommendation you defined.
Enter “@.” The Push Personalization dialog box appears.
Search for “WhatNextToWatch,” which is the name of the recommendation that you built.

Click Done. The following JINJA code is inserted in the Message field:

Edit the code to run a loop through each content and list down the first suggestion because the highly confident suggestions come first from the Recommendation engine. The higher the confidence, the topper the content will be in the list. The final JINJA code looks as follows:

JINJA
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	    {% if ProductSet.WhatNextToWatch%}

	    {% for product in ProductSet.WhatNextToWatch[0:1]%}

	    {{product.title}}

	    {% endfor %}

	    {% else %}

	    MOE_NOT_SEND

	    {% endif %}
In line 2, the loop does only one iteration using “[0:1]” in the query. If you want to suggest the top 3, you can change the same to “[0:3]” and so on. The {{product.product_name}} element in line 3 prints the name of the suggested content. For more information, refer to MoEngage Templating Language (JINJA).
Enter the following code to get the image of the recommended watch:

JINJA
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	    {% if ProductSet.WhatNextToWatch%}

	    {% for product in ProductSet.WhatNextToWatch[0:1]%}

	    {{product.image_url}}

	    {% endfor %}

	    {% else %}

	    MOE_NOT_SEND

	    {% endif %}
In Line 3, {{product.image_url}} provides the link to the image of the concerned title of the suggested content.
Add a deep link to the push notification by mentioning the URL that will directly take them to your app's mentioned title or suggestion list. This reduces the possibility of a user dropping off before finding the suggested content.

Click Next to move to the third step, ""Schedule and goals,"" where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 3: Schedule and Goals
In the Send campaign section, select when the campaign should be delivered to your users and the periodicity of delivery. For example, Daily at 10 AM, starting from March 10, 2024.

Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information, refer to Create Push Campaigns.
Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created a recommendation on what to watch next and sent it to your users through push notifications.

Now that we have published the campaign for our use case using Recommendations, we can check out other possibilities of MoEngage’s Recommendations."

How to Recommend Content to Users Based on the Sequence of Preferences
Introduction

Many OTT Platforms allow users to select the genre of their preference in the very beginning. This helps the brand understand the customers and give them choices that are relevant to them, improving the time spent on the app with relevant, interesting, and new content.

Users can show interest in multiple genres of content. Users selecting Action, Comedy, and Thriller should get recommendations in the same sequence. 

We can give choices on the App or in marketing communications. For communications, such as Push or Email, MoEngage can recommend content based on users' preferences. We can achieve this using AI Recommendations.

In this article, we will use Recommendations and Push to recommend content to users based on the sequence of preferences.

Expected Result

Each user gets a personalized nudge based on their choices. The recommendations are ranked in the order of the choice selection. For example, if the user selects thriller, horror, and comedy in this order, the first preference of recommendations would go to thriller, then horror, and finally comedy.

Prerequisites

Events to track the action of a user searching for content, watching the content, adding content to watch later, rating content, completing the content, and each action’s related information such as the genre, title, type, progress, rating, and platform. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.
Mapping of these tracked events to the concerned MoEngage events. For information on mapping custom events to MoEngage events, refer here.
A catalog and a respective feed with a list of available contents and all related information about the same, from the name or title to the director, cast, and description to any awards that the title won in any category. Set the feed to refresh at a suitable interval so that the latest information can be maintained. For more information on product catalogs and feeds, refer here.
Settings for one or more channels such as Push, Email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
Create a Recommendation

The first step is to capture the user’s preferences. During their onboarding, they would select the preferred genres, which can be sequentially captured in MoEngage using different user attributes. For example:

Choice 1: Thriller
Choice 2: Horror
Choice 3: Comedy

These are three different user attributes. Once this is captured, we need to create a Recommendation Model.

In this section, let us create a recommendation based on the user's action.

Navigate to the MoEngage dashboard and select Content > Recommendations from the left navigation. The Recommendations page is displayed. For more information, refer to Creating User Action Recommendations.
At the top right corner, click + Create recommendation. This will take you to the first step, ""Select recommendation model.""

Under Predictive, click the Similar items card.
Click Next. It takes you to the second step ""Create recommendation"". Enter the following details:
Recommendation name: Enter a name for the recommendation. This will be the name through which you will refer to the output of this recommendation model.
Recommendation description: Enter a description for the recommendation. This description will help you understand the model's aim.
Catalog: Select the catalog with the list of products you offer with all the related information.
Under Generate recommendation based on the most recent, select All user actions.

While filtering, note that the value product_id would contain the category names Thriller, Horror, and Comedy. This would be compared with User Attributes: Choice 1, and the results would be populated based on Choice 1.
Click Create to save the changes and run the model.
Please note that this will take 24 hours. You can find the status of the model on the Recommendations home page:
info	

Information

Create three different recommendations for three other choices.

Now that we created the recommendation, let us create a Push campaign and personalize it using Recommendations.

Create a Push Campaign

In this section, let us create a campaign.

Step 1: Target Users
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Outbound, select Push > Periodic.

You are taken to the first step, ""Target users,"" of defining your campaign.
Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. 
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign.
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

In the Target Audience section, select All users.

In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step ""Content"" where you can define the content that will go into your Push campaign. 
Step 2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For our example, select Basic notification.

In the Message title field, enter a title.
While defining the message, select the product set generated through the recommendation you defined. Enter “@” and search for the name of the recommendation that you built, in the Push Personalization pop-up.


 

 

Using product sets, you can personalize the campaign—title, body, and landing page. If the client wants three different communications, they can have a flow with three different Push campaigns with three different recommendations based on the choices in the order of choice 1, choice 2, and choice 3.

 

You can also put this in an Email in the same order.

 

 

Row 1 is Recommendations for Choice 1; Row 2 is Recommendations for Choice 2; and Row 3 is Recommendations for Choice 3.

Click Next to move to the third step, ""Schedule and goals,"" where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 3: Schedule and Goals
In the Send campaign section, select when the campaign should be delivered to your users and the periodicity of delivery.
Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information about these settings, refer to Create Push Campaigns.

Click Publish.

This would give the client more personalized communications for the end users to consume and try out. The better the recommendations, the more the end user would be hooked to the app, increasing screen time and becoming a promoter.

Conclusion

In this use case, we used Recommendations and Push to recommend content to users based on the sequence of preferences.

This is one more step towards increasing the user's screen time and making him binge-watch more shows/ programs. This would increase the user's stickiness to the App."

How to Activate Dormant Users with Memories
Introduction

The efforts to acquire new customers should not be nullified by losing customers. The trend goes from customers coming on the website or app to becoming dormant and getting lost. Retaining dormant customers thus plays a crucial role.

The users should be engaged by multiple campaigns or offers that help them realize the value of the brand they had intended to be associated with. One of the most effective ways of capturing the attention of the customer is by showcasing the memories they have spent with the brand. These can be either the last video the user watched or the last purchase the user made.

In this article, we will create a Catalog, a Recommendation, and a Push campaign to target users based on their past experience, such as users who have made purchases in the last 30 days.

Merlin AI Copywriter for Global and Local Language
Overview

Vernacular languages in marketing messages can help in connecting better with the audience, building trust, reaching a wider audience, and gaining a competitive advantage.

Vernacular languages help to connect with the target audience on a deeper level. When a message is conveyed in a language the audience speaks and understands well, it resonates well with them.
When a brand communicates in the local language, it gives the impression that the brand understands and respects the culture and traditions of the audience. This helps in building a strong relationship and trust with the audience.
Not everyone is comfortable with English or other widely spoken languages. By using vernacular languages, brands can reach out to those sections of the audience who are more comfortable with their native language.
In a market where most brands are using English or other widely spoken languages for their marketing messages, using vernacular languages can help a brand stand out and attract more attention.

In this article, we will learn how to use the Merlin AI Copywriter for global and local languages.

How to Create a Segment Based on Links Clicked in Emails
Introduction

As marketers, we tend to add several URLs in Email. These could be links of recommended products, Call to Action (CTA) buttons asking for feedback, or websites that could give more details to a curious user. Click Through Rate (CTR) information of the campaign would only give what percent of the users clicked at least one link. However, marketers often want to know which links are being clicked more and sometimes want to engage with the audience that clicked on a specific link.

In this article, we will learn how to segment users based on the feedback they share on a customer satisfaction survey email.

Users have some options on the feedback survey. Each option is a link that lands them on the thank you page or website. We want to segment these users based on the option selected and accordingly engage them with different types of communications. The following are the options on the feedback survey:

Good or OK: When users select this option, send an email thanking them and having recommendations for their next purchase based on their purchase history.
Bad: When users select this option, target them using IVR or telecallers to explore the reason for their feedback.
library_add_check	

Prerequisites

An email partner integrated with MoEngage. You can refer to the document for configuring the Email channel.
After configuring the Email channel, the marketer must send out an Email campaign asking for feedback and each option should have a distinct link to capture the option.

Here, the Good is associated with: http://www.example.com/good. Similarly, OK and Bad will be associated with different links which would be unique identifiers.
After the Email campaign is sent, you must wait for 36 or 48 hours as users take their time to browse through the promotional content and share their feedback.
Post this, you can segment users based on their responses.
Create a Segment
Navigate to the MoEngage dashboard and click Segment > Create Segment.

For segmenting users, select those who have clicked the Email. The following are a few samples of segments:

""Email Clicked"" is a standard MoEngage event captured when a user clicks an email.
The Campaign Name or Readable Campaign ID is the unique identifier to identify the origination of the clicks while link or moe_click_id would help us with the exact click option.
The moe_click_id can be retrieved from campaign analytics:

The above segmentation can be used for campaign creation or analytics. MoEngage allows you to:
Create Custom Segment.
Create Campaigns.
Analyze User Behavior or Drop-offs.
Conclusion

In this use case, we learnt how to segment users based on the feedback they share on a customer satisfaction survey email.

With these segments, we can understand the user’s pulse, send recommendation based on the the option selected, and analyse clicks."

Steps to find a logged-in user,https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058165372-How-to-Find-a-User-in-MoEngage,"Back to all Usecases
How to Find a User in MoEngage

Users are recognized in a system using identifiers such as a User ID or unique identifier generated and associated with them in the system. Users are categorized as logged-in/ registered users and anonymous users in MoEngage. For more information on these user types, refer to Users in MoEngage. We've enumerated the steps to be followed for finding logged-in and anonymous users in this article.

Steps to find a logged-in user

A user who logs into your app/website would have parameters such as Mobile Number, Email Address, or Custom Identifier- the ID (generated by the app). For each user, MoEngage also generates an identifier, the MoEngage ID. You can search for the user using any of these parameters.

To search using Mobile Number, Email address, ID, or MoEngage ID 

Navigate to MoEngage Dashboard -> Segment-> Create Segment
Type one of the parameters in the user search box and search.
This search results in a list of users matching searched text with the parameters.
Click the user you wish to view, and the user profile of the respective user is displayed. Note: Search by MoEngage ID is not supported for a user base below 10K.
Admin and Managers can also leave instructions for their team members on how to look up their users, as shown below.
Steps to find anonymous users

Anonymous users typically have only the MoEngage ID. You can, however, search for them using the advertising identifiers or web push tokens depending on the platform on which the user is available. The steps to identify users on the Web, Android, and Mobile platforms are described below.

Android Users
iOS Users

How to Encourage Users to Repeat Orders for Categories Without a Due Date
Introduction

As Marketers, we want to reach out to users at regular intervals to recharge their wallets. Users who regularly recharge the service should receive more notifications, while users who recharge the service once every 15-20 days should receive fewer notifications.

For example, users of FASTag do not really have a due date. We should send them periodic communication based on their previous recharge durations.

The identification of these segments can be manual or we can use machine learning (ML) to identify such users.

There are two key elements in achieving this use case:

Identifying right segments
Creating corresponding campaigns
Expected Result

Timely nudges to the end users to remind them to recharge their wallets.

Create Segments

The most important step here is the segment identification. You can do it in three ways:

It can be driven by an algorithm based on machine learning. Each user can get a tag—High (1-7 days), Moderate (7-14 days), or Low (14- days)—based on their algorithm, and this would be added as a user attribute in the user’s profile.
The user attributes will be updated based on APIs. You must execute a cron job using User APIs. The payload should contain the new segment name. The frequency of this depends on your business requirements.
Create hard-coded segments:
Has executed Purchase at least 2 times in last 2 weeks - High
Has executed Purchase at least 2 times in last 3 weeks (Exclude High) - Medium
Has executed Purchase at least 2 times in last 4 weeks (Exclude Medium) - Low

Create RF Segments, and you will get eight segments.

Combine two or more segments to create High, Medium, and Low segments.

The creation of these segments is important because this would lead to three different periodic campaigns with different repetition frequencies:

Segment	Repetition Frequency
High	7 days
Medium	14 days
Low	25 days

These definitions can change based on your observations or machine learning. Now that we have created segments, let us proceed with the campaign creation.

Create a Push Campaign
Navigate to the sidebar on the left and click Engage > Campaigns and click + Create campaign or click + Create new > Campaign.
Under Outbound, select Push > Periodic.

You are taken to the first step, ""Target users,"" of defining your campaign.
Enter the following details:
Team: Select a team if your organization has teams enabled for your account. 
Campaign name: Enter a name for the campaign.
Campaign tags: Select the required campaign tags.

In the Target Audience section, select Filter users by and select the segments.
These segments can be based on User Attribute (Case 1), User Behaviour (Case 2), or Custom Segment (Case 3).
Segmentation based on User Attribute



Segmentation based on User Behaviour

 

 

Segmentation based on Custom Segments

 

 

There will be a different campaign for each segment.

In the Target Platforms section, select Android.

Click Next to move to the second step, ""Content,"" where you can define the content for your Push campaign. 
Step 2: Content
Select the template that you would like to use. For our example, select Basic notification.

Enter the required details.
Click Next to move to the third step, ""Schedule and goals,"" where you can define your campaign's schedule and goals.
Step 3: Schedule and Goals
In the Send campaign section, select when the campaign should be delivered to your users and the periodicity of delivery.


Decide on the frequency of the communication. You can choose daily or weekly as follows:

 

 

For Daily, we can repeat the campaign after every 7/14/21 days.

 

 

We can change the frequency to weekly depending on the business model.

Change the deliverability settings based on your requirements. For more information about these settings, refer to Create Push Campaigns.
Click Publish.
Conclusion

In this use case, we created segments and a Push campaign to encourage users to repeat orders for categories without a due date.

Timely reminders can help users to add wallet balance/recharge FASTag. This would create a brand image in the end user’s mind, and the end user would think of this App for making any sort of transaction/recharge."

How to Identify Web Push subscribers

In this article, we've described how you can discover and segment Web Push subscribers for the following scenarios:

Number of users who have granted Web Push permission on your website
Number of users who have subscribed/unsubscribed in a specified time duration
Segment users based on the Web Page URL on which they subscribed to push notifications
Segment users based on the Web Page URL they viewed
Number of users receiving and clicking Web Push notifications 
library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Web Push is already integrated. For more information, refer to Web Push Integration.

 

Navigation
All these queries will be run on the following navigation:  MoEngage Dashboard > Segment > Create Segment.
You can view the Daily and Total Web Push Subscribers count on the following navigation as well: MoEngage Dashboard > Dashboard > Key Metrics.
Identifying the Total Web Push Subscribers

To identify the number of users who have subscribed to Web Push Notifications:

Select the Filter users by option.
In the User Property tab, select the Web Push Subscription Status attribute and select True from the drop-down.

This will also enable you to identify the number of subscribers who unsubscribed after subscribing to Push notifications once.

Note: Earlier, Web Push subscribers were identified using the criteria Web Push Preference is Granted. We are phasing this user attribute soon and replacing it with Web Push Subscription Status, which is dynamic and updates the user's push subscription status either when users visit your website or when we get a response from GCM about the user's push token.

Web Push Subscriptions

You can also find out how many users have subscribed to Web Push over a specified time (allowed time filters - in the last X days, in between 2 dates, before a date, after a date, on a date, and today).

The MoEngage identifier for this event is the user behavior termed Subscribed to Web Push. To identify the number of subscriptions:

Select the Filter users by option.
in the User behavior tab, select the condition Has Executed Subscribed to Web Push event at least 1 time and add the timeframe of your choice, as shown below.

 

Web Push Unsubscriptions

You can find out how many users have unsubscribed from Web Push over a specified time (allowed time filters - in the last X days, in between 2 dates, before a date, after a date, on a date, and today).

MoEngage identifier for this event is the user behavior termed  Denied Web Push Subscription.  To identify the number of unsubscriptions:

Select the Filter users by option.
in the User behavior tab, select the condition Has Executed Denied Web Push Subscription event at least 1 time and add the timeframe of your choice, as shown below. 
info	

Note

There are two sources from where we get to know about users unsubscribing from Web Push Notifications. You can select the event attribute Source to distinguish between the two.

Website: When users directly remove permission from the website and reload the page, we update the subscription status to False and create the event Web User Unsubscribed with the event attribute Source as Website.
Campaign: When users remove Push permission from Browser Settings, we get to know about the status from Push Services (GCM, AutoPush, etc.) when a campaign is sent to that user. We update the subscription status to False and create the event Web User Unsubscribed with the event attribute Source as Campaign.
Web Subscription URL

The Web Push Subscription Page URL is a user attribute that helps you identify the pages of your website on which users are subscribing to Push. This can be useful for creating custom segments of users using the attribute, as described below.

To send only sports-related notifications to a certain set of users, you can add the criteria as Web Push Subscription Page URL contains sports.

Web Page Viewed (Viewed Web Page)

The Viewed Web Page event helps you identify the page of your website being viewed by the users. You can use this to create a segment containing users who viewed a specific landing page on your website and send relevant notifications, as shown below.

 

A popular use-case of the Viewed Web Page event is to send viewed/cart abandonment notifications to your subscribers and take them directly to the web page they dropped off from. For more information, refer to Web Push Campaigns in 60 Minutes.

Notification Received Web

The Notification Received Web event helps you to identify the users receiving and clicking notifications from the campaigns that you have created. If you wish to identify this event for a particular campaign, mention the Campaign ID as an event attribute in this query."

How to Analyze web activity

The MoEngage Web SDK (Javascript API) enables you to track all user activity across your website (both desktop and mobile). It seamlessly maps user activity across your app and website to a unique user profile. As a result, you can easily review user behavior on your website and target users across multiple channels effectively.

For more information about tracking events and user attributes, refer to Track website events and Track web user attributes.

Prerequisites

To get the best data from your web integration, your technical team should ensure the following:

If you have already integrated our mobile SDKs (Android and iOS), you should use the same user attribute and event names across your App and Web tracking.
If you have an identifier to uniquely identify your user, you should track this user attribute as mentioned here. This will enable the merging of users based on this identifier across all platforms.
How to see user activity on the Dashboard?

Once this integration is complete, you can start seeing user activity under the Recent Events page.

Navigate to the Test & Debug section and click on Recent Events in the sidebar of your MoEngage Dashboard.
You can run segmentation queries on the events you have tracked on your website.
To see the recent events for web users, add an event attribute - ""Platform"" is ""WEB"", as shown below."

Segment Users Who Uninstalled Your Application

Losing a user you managed to engage with your application is a potential downfall. Users may uninstall your application due to various reasons. Even though bringing them back is hard, losing track of those users who uninstall your application will seriously impact your business performance.

Advantages of segmenting users who uninstall your app
Identify root causes of uninstalls: By analyzing the behavior and characteristics of users who uninstall, you can understand why users leave. This enables you to identify and address issues like poor user experience, technical problems, or unmet expectations.
Improve user experience: Understanding why users uninstall allows you to address usability issues, optimize onboarding, and enhance the overall app experience.
Targeted retention efforts: Segmenting helps you focus on retaining specific user groups that are at risk of uninstalling, such as those who haven't used the app recently or those who have encountered technical problems.
Improve app quality: Identifying common reasons for uninstalls helps developers prioritize bug fixes, feature improvements, and overall app optimization.
Understand user behavior: Segmenting helps you understand how users interact with your app before uninstalling, providing valuable insights into their needs and preferences.
Send personalized communication: Segmented data allows you to personalize messages to engage users who are at risk of uninstalling.

We will achieve this use case by creating a segment to target users who uninstalled your application in the last 10 days. We will demonstrate an effective approach to segmenting those users by identifying users who uninstalled your application at least once.

Expected Result

You will get a segment of users who uninstalled your application and re-installed it in the last 10 days.


library_add_check	

Prerequisites

Events to track uninstalls and installs made by users must be available in MoEngage. In this example, we will use the events Uninstalled from device and User installs the app. To understand how to track events, refer to the Developer Guide.

Create a Segment
On the left navigation menu in the MoEngage dashboard, click Segments and then click Create segment.
Click the Filter users by option, and then click the User behavior tab.
Add the filter criteria to segment users who have executed the Uninstalled from device event at least once in the last 10 days, as shown in the image below: 

 

info	

Information

 

You must know your application's data protection policy before adding a time frame. Data in some applications may not be available after 30 days, and it varies.

To get a deeper look into particular groups of users, you can select one or more attributes from the list to narrow the segment. These include:
Days since last active: Represents the number of days between the last active and uninstall times.
Days till last active: Represents the number of days between install and last active times.
Click + Create.
To identify users who uninstalled your application and have not reinstalled it again, you can add another filter on the User behavior tab that triggers the User installs the app event in the last 10 days. This excludes the users who reinstalled your application from the Uninstalled from device list. 

info	

Information

The date on which a user actually uninstalled your application on Android devices can be earlier than the date recorded in your data. This difference may occur due to the nature of the mechanism used to detect uninstalls.
Uninstall tracking for iOS was deprecated on August 10, 2023, following the significant adoption of iOS 15 and 16 versions, which do not support tracking failed delivery attempts using silent push. However, failed delivery attempts of regular Push campaign messages will still appear as uninstalls for iOS devices.
Conclusion

With the segments created above, you can run an Email campaign targeting users who uninstalled your application in the last 10 days.

info	

Information

You cannot send push notifications to users who uninstalled your application. The best way to reach them is via Email campaigns. To run an Email campaign, you must configure your user attributes with the email addresses of those uninstalled users."

Segment Users of Specific App Versions

There can be numerous reasons to target users of specific App Versions. For example, when you have the latest update, you can create a segment of users by App Version and communicate the latest update to the users of that particular version.

Advantages of segmenting users by app version
Targeted messaging and experiences: You can tailor in-app messages, onboarding flows, and even specific features to users based on their app version. This allows for a more relevant and personalized user experience. For example, you might show a different onboarding experience to users on an older version of the app compared to those on the latest version.
Controlled feature rollouts: Segmenting users by app version enables you to gradually roll out new features to different user groups, allowing for testing and refinement before a full release. This helps mitigate potential issues and ensures a smoother user experience.
Bug fixes and stability: By targeting users with bug fixes or updates, you can quickly address issues specific to older app versions, ensuring a more stable and reliable experience for everyone.
Improved user engagement and retention: By providing a better, more personalized experience, you can increase user engagement and retention, leading to a more successful app.
Data analysis and insights: Segmenting by app version provides valuable insights into user behavior and preferences across different versions, allowing for better decision-making and optimization.
Encourage upgrades: You can use targeted messaging and offers to encourage users on older versions to upgrade to the latest version, ensuring they benefit from the latest features and improvements.

We will achieve this use case by creating a segment to target users of the current App Version 8.3.1.

Expected Result

You will get a segment of users who are using the App Version 8.3.1.

Personalized Reward Programs: The engagement platform has deep insights on customer preferences, behaviors, and purchase history. This helps brands to run personalized reward programs, which enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Seamless Customer Experience: The integration provides a seamless customer experience across all touch points. Customers can access their rewards, check their loyalty points, and redeem rewards through the engagement platform, ensuring a consistent brand experience.
Gamification and Loyalty Tiers: The integration allows for gamification elements to be incorporated into the loyalty program. It includes progress bars, badges, and challenges that motivate customers to earn more loyalty points. Additionally, brands can introduce tiered loyalty levels, where customers unlock exclusive perks and benefits as they move up the loyalty ladder.
Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Brands can send personalized offers, promotions, and notifications to loyalty members, boosting engagement and driving repeat purchases.
Customer Feedback and Surveys: It empowers brands to gather valuable feedback and insights from their loyal customers. Brands can incentivise customers to complete surveys, provide feedback, or participate in market research, allowing for data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement.
Omnichannel Customer Journey: Brands can unify customer data across multiple channels. This means customers can earn and redeem loyalty points through online platforms, mobile apps, in-store purchases, or even social media interactions. It ensures a consistent loyalty experience regardless of the platform used.
Use Cases

The following are some key use cases for connecting a loyalty program with a customer engagement platform that can enhance customer retention and drive revenue growth:

Focussed target audience increases effectiveness of promotions, campaign response rates, and ultimately drives higher engagement levels.
Personalised marketing content (tailored recommendations, offers, and rewards) fosters a sense of connection, enhances customer satisfaction, and increases engagement.
Using enhanced loyalty programs, brands can evolve and adapt their loyalty programs to keep customers excited and engaged by identifying gaps, refining reward structures, and introducing new incentives.
Connect Loyalty Data with MoEngage

This section describes how to connect loyalty data with MoEngage.

Listed Loyalty Partners

MoEngage already connects with 12+ loyalty partners. Using any of the listed partners, you can follow the guidelines to start using the loyalty data in MoEngage campaigns.

Deprecation of Email Support

 

 

At MoEngage, we are committed to continuous improvement, working tirelessly to provide you with exceptional service and a better customer experience. As part of this resolve, we are excited to announce a significant step to enhance our support system - a shift from email support to an organized and efficient web portal ticketing system. A simple and efficient way to contact our Support team from within your MoEngage Dashboard.



Starting April 2024, we will be phasing out email support via support@moengage.com and transitioning towards a web portal ticketing system. The emails sent to this address will no longer be monitored post 29th April 2024. This strategic change is aimed at improving the way we offer support, enabling us to serve you better and faster.



Why make the switch to our Support Web Form?

Supporting customers through a customer support portal is a universal best practice, here are some benefits.
Faster Response Times: Using our Support Web form, your query instantly arrives at the desk of the right support engineer. This automated sorting and routing means your queries get addressed faster, considerably reducing wait times.


Improved SLA Adherence: We like delivering resolutions while strictly adhering to SLAs. With this, your tickets will be mapped promptly with the appropriate SLAs that your ticket demands. 


Direct and Improved Communication: Expect more effective and focused communication from our support team. You'll receive automated updates as soon as your ticket is received and when a resolution is reached, helping maintain transparency throughout the process.


Better Tracking: The web form ensures comprehensive tracking of all your support queries in one place. This integration allows us to understand your needs better and make informed decisions to enhance our products and services.

We're excited about this transition and believe it will significantly improve the support experience for all our customers. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this transition. Detailed instructions on how to use the new Support Web Form are given here: Using the Support Web Form

Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions. 

Thank you for your continued support and for being an integral part of the MoEngage family."

The PII Masking feature helps organizations safeguard sensitive information by masking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) fields in campaign previews. This ensures compliance with privacy standards and protects PII data, such as user and event attributes, from exposure in the user interface (UI).
Previously, PII masking applied only to the user profile, meaning masked values were hidden within the profile but remained accessible in personalization content. This allowed certain masked values to appear in plain text on the user interface, which could compromise privacy.

With this feature, you can:

Validate content and test personalization without compromising customer data privacy.
Ensure PII fields marked in the data management or Content API are masked (displayed as “XXXX”) while non-PII fields remain visible.
Enhance data security during campaign testing by preventing unauthorized PII exposure.

For more information, refer to the below articles:

Integration Validation helps you:

Test Android SDK features directly from the dashboard.

Coupon Provisioning System for Single-Use Coupon Codes

Single-use coupon codes are unique coupons distributed to individual users/customers as part of a marketing strategy that ensures that no two users receive the same coupon. Traditionally, marketing campaigns predominantly relied on generic coupon codes accessible to all customers. However, such campaigns fell short of delivering a personalized experience and were frequently prone to misuse and fraud.

MoEngage allows marketers to easily import coupons and distribute them to users while managing usage reports for audits and debugging. Additionally, it offers proactive monitoring and alerting on coupon availability and expiry.

MoEngage also offers APIs for managing coupons that can be seamlessly integrated, reducing the need for manual intervention. You can use these APIs to add, manage, or audit coupons from your internal systems to MoEngage.

For more information, refer to Coupons and Coupon APIs.

info	

Information

MoEngage does not manage the creation of codes. It only allocates single-use coupon codes and distributes them throughout the configured marketing channels.

Businesses/brands must implement redemption validation on their end.

You must create coupon codes from third-party tools or your internal systems and compile them into a CSV file. Then, you can import this coupon file to the MoEngage Coupons platform to send these single-use coupon-based campaigns.
Data Management Dashboard

The revamped UI of the Data Management dashboard of MoEngage now displays the count of auto-blocked events and user attributes. The following are the key features of the Data Management dashboard:

Clear visibility of unique events and unique user attributes tracked for your MoEngage account out of the total allowed quota of events and user attributes.
Displays the count of auto-blocked events and user attributes automatically blocked due to a limit breach.

Enhancements in iOS and Web Push Permission and Reachability

The iOS push permission and reachability now have the following enhancements:

Introduction of Provisional Push Notifications: This allows you to send notifications silently and lets your users experience the value of push notifications before deciding whether to grant full push permission.
Changes in reachability to include the Opt-in status: The Reachability Push iOS user attribute is now updated to incorporate the opt-in status of the users’ devices. This will have the following values:

201 - Reachable and opted in
202 - Not reachable due to opt-out
200 - Reachable an opt-in status unknown
Changes in the event when the Opt-in status for a user changes: As the  Push Preference Changed iOS event is getting deprecated, this behavior will now be  tracked by the Subscribed to Push and Unsubscribed to Push events with the event attribute Platform = iOS.
Note that this change applies to iOS devices with SDK upgraded after September 9, 2024 and Flutter and React Native SDK released after October 1, 2024.

The web push permission and reachability now have the following enhancements:

Changes in reachability to include the Opt-in status: The Reachability Push Web user attribute is now updated to incorporate the opt-in status of the users’ devices. This will have the following values:

201 - Reachable and opted in
202 - Not reachable due to opt-out
Changes in the event when the Opt-in status for a user changes:
As the Subscribed to Web Push event is getting deprecated, this behavior will now be tracked by the Subscribed to Push event with the event attribute Platform = Web.
As the Unsubscribed to Web push event is getting deprecated, this behavior will now be tracked by the Unsubscribed to Push event with the event attribute Platform = Web.

For more information, refer to iOS Push Permission and Reachability and Web Push Permission and Reachability.

Enhanced Click-Analysis in In-app Messaging

Before this release, tracking clicks on a widget was a tedious process. You had to navigate to the segmentation section, write detailed queries using campaign and widget IDs, and then extract a segment for downloading it or creating a campaign. The same process was applicable for user behavior analysis or funnel creation, and it was often challenging to find the widget ID.

This enhancement allows you to handle all these tasks directly within the Click analysis tab on the campaign info page.

Sorting on Tables in Analytics

Previously, you had to download data to external tools for custom sorting, which added extra steps and delayed your workflow. The new in-platform sorting feature removes this complication.
The sorting functionality lets you easily sort data in ascending or descending order across multiple columns.

Sorting is available on:

Different analysis categories: User, Behavior, Funnel, Session, and Source tables
Custom Dashboards in the table view

For more information, refer to Analyze.

Delay for Custom Event in OSM

You can now add a delay in delivering the On-site Messaging (OSM) instead of rendering it immediately after a custom event. This feature is beneficial for scenarios where timing is critical, but immediate messaging may not be ideal. For instance, when a user completes a form submission (custom event), the OSM can wait a few seconds before displaying a message, allowing users to finish their workflow comfortably.

This feature can lead to smoother, less disruptive user experiences, giving end-users time to complete their current tasks without interruptions.

For more information, refer to Create OSM Pro Campaign.

User Activity Beyond 30 Days

MoEngage now shows user activity on the User Profile for the entire duration of your account's data retention. Activity Info shows all events and event attributes performed by the user in the last 30/60 days (based on plans and data center), sorted by the event execution time. This helps you get a clear picture of your user’s action history.

You’ll notice that the date range in the Event Filters section now shows dates up to the account’s data retention. For events beyond the last 30 days, you can choose a maximum date range of 7 days, select the events and attributes you want to see for a user, and click Apply to see the results.

Object Data Type

In addition to the existing data type attributes such as string, numeric, and boolean, MoEngage enables you to use Object data type to run deeper queries and create custom user segments for more personalized marketing campaigns.

As a marketer, you may want to segment users depending on a specific item they have added to their cart. There may be enumerable attributes that define the specified item, which can be encapsulated in a single Object and used to identify the item. For example, you want to log a list of users who added the book ""Atonement"" to their cart. The book can be defined using the following Object:

Sample Code
Light
Dark
content_copy
Copy Code
	""book"":{

	""product_name"" : ""Atonement""

	""price"" : 100,

	""sku"" : ""abc123""

	}

For more information, refer to Support for Object Data Type and Object Data Type in Segmentation.

Reach out to your MoEngage Customer Success Manager to enable this for your application.

Identity Resolution

The Identity Resolution feature allows brands to integrate multiple profiles of the same user obtained from various data sources. When various sources include clear identity information, such as a customer ID, an email address, or a phone number, you can combine them to build a unified customer profile. This maintains a single source of truth for each user, allowing you to seamlessly track their behavior on your application and regulate your business strategies accordingly.

For more information, refer to User Identity Management.

Campaign Migration

Campaign migration ensures a smoother, more efficient workflow, allowing users to dedicate more time to strategic priorities. Moving campaigns between workspaces was a time-consuming, manual task with a high potential for errors. With this feature, you can now transfer campaigns with a single click, ensuring accuracy and eliminating the need for manual labor.

This feature offers a faster turnaround time for production campaigns by automating the migration process, significantly reducing the chance of errors. It minimizes campaign-sending failures by highlighting missing elements, allowing users to focus on more critical tasks.

This feature allows you to:

Copy multiple campaigns from one workspace to another and save them as drafts.
Migrate campaigns from one workspace to another within the same data cluster (DC).
Receive error messages if segmentation attributes, tags, or personalization attributes (for example, Content API, Content Block) are missing.
Access migrated campaigns easily with the new Imported state in drafts.
Import campaigns in any status except Draft and Archived.

For more information, refer to Campaign Migration.

Custom Alerts on Behavior Analytics

Custom Alerts allow you to monitor adoption trends or ensure smooth campaign performance. You can define custom thresholds for key events and attributes, keeping an eye on the metrics that matter most to you. You can receive alerts via email when trends cross those thresholds. You can also keep your team informed about any spike in user sign-ups or dip in engagement.

Where can I set alerts? 

You can set alerts in Behavior Analysis on Line Charts, Bar Charts, and Column Charts.

What are the custom thresholds supported?

Above or Below the Metric Value.
Increased by or Decreased by % the Metric Value, compared to the previous duration.
Increased by or Decreased by # the Metric Value, compared to the previous duration.

What are the alert frequencies?

Daily, Weekly, and Monthly.

To learn more, see Alerts in Analytics.

Personalize Web Pages Using Custom Attributes

You can now target the appropriate web page group without going through a series of hoops and URL filtering criteria. You may utilize custom attribute(s) to tailor the user experience based on the kind of webpage they see and use the webpage's data to provide individualized experiences.

Some use cases that can be achieved with custom attributes include:

Page-type targeting is useful for fashion retailers to market certain fashion items to customers who are viewing particular product pages. For example, customers who frequently visit product pages for handbags, get personalized recommendations for handbags.
Page-type targeting allows a travel agency to tailor material to the browsing habits of its customers. For example, when customers search for family vacation packages, they may get extra deals for children and customized travel advice and advice for family vacations.
An online bookshop can give personalized suggestions based on the genre or author sites that customers have visited. For example, customers who are perusing mystery-themed books will see tailored suggestions for other well-liked titles in the same category.

To set up custom attributes, see Custom Attributes.

Introducing the ""Workspace"" Construct on the MoEngage Dashboard

In this release, MoEngage announced an important update to the MoEngage dashboard. To enhance user understanding and better represent your projects' nature, we have replaced the term App with Workspace.

Why Is the Term ""Workspace""?

The term Workspace provides a more comprehensive understanding of the functionalities and capabilities within this section. It encapsulates the application and all related activities, such as customer segmentation, campaign execution, data analysis, and more. It signifies a more inclusive space where a multifaceted spectrum of work gets done.

Above all, the language change to Workspace better aligns with our aim of making the MoEngage dashboard an intuitive and user-centric platform. We believe this change will better represent the collaborative environment within the platform, making it easier for all stakeholders to discuss, plan, and execute their strategies.

A few Key Areas where we have changed the construct:

Add App -> Add Workspace for new workspace creation
General Settings: App ID -> Workspace ID
API Settings: App ID -> Workspace ID
Notification Sent, Notification Dropped, and Notification Failed Events for Push Notifications

You can now generate user-level events to visualize the end-to-end notification delivery funnel via these new events.

Notification Sent (Android or Web): This event is generated for all users who successfully attempted to be sent and accepted by the sending service.
Notification Dropped: This event is generated for users when they are not meant to be attempted for a campaign because of reachability or campaign control reasons.
Notification Failed (Android, iOS, and Web): This event is generated for users when an attempt fails because of content or sending service-level reasons.

We also have added some additional attributes to help you manage this data:

Reason Group: Broad category of the reason to drop/fail for quick filtering (reachability, campaign control, campaign content, Sending failure)
Reason: Exact reason for drop/fail (no device, no active device token, frequency capping (FC), do not disturb (DND), minimum delay, not registered, client connection error, and so on)
Service: FCM, APNS, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, HMS.

For more details on Reason Group and Reasons, refer to Push Analytics and Info.

Catalog Update Alerts

The catalog update alert system meticulously tracks catalog updates, instantly updating marketers about the status of updates.

Whenever a feed file is successfully processed, the system sends an email indicating the completion of the process. Importantly, it includes detailed statistics of processing results.

In case of any processing failure, the alert system provides error messages. These messages are important because they explain what went wrong during the file processing, thereby providing insight to help rectify the issue.

Note: From now on, when you create a new catalog, your email address will be automatically subscribed to catalog update alerts. To modify the subscription preferences, visit the Manage alerts section at the top of the catalog page.

For more information, refer to Catalogs.

Search Items

The catalog is now equipped with search functionality to assist you in finding a particular item across all millions of items in your catalog.
With this release, we also introduced an Items tab in the UI that contains a comprehensive list of items across all the feeds.

For more information, refer to Catalogs.

Changes in Sending Speed with Private Key Configuration

MoEngage changed the maximum throttle speed for Push notifications to 500,000 RPM to ensure a single campaign does not breach the project limit. However, they may still see drops because of parallel campaigns.

For more information, refer to FCM Authentication.

Push Reachability Dashboard

Reachability is the measure of whether or not a user can be reached through a channel of your choice. The Reachability Dashboard at MoEngage shows you the reachability trends of all users who opted in to receive your Push notifications and those who did not.

The Push Reachability Dashboard provides a snapshot of your push campaign’s performance across four KPIs:

Push eligible users
Push reachable users
Opted-in users
Opted-out users
Why Does This Matter?

With Android 13 rolling out, understanding the nuances of user opt-ins has never been more crucial. Our dashboard not only simplifies these metrics but also turns them into actionable insights that can drive your strategy forward.

For more information, refer to Push Reachability Dashboard.

Save Templates as Presets

Video Tutorial:

For more information, refer to Drag and Drop Editor. 

In-Session Attributes

MoEngage introduces the ability to add in-session attributes to your OSM campaigns. In-session attributes allow you to group and target users based on their actions on your website. You can create campaigns that are relevant to each user's current session, right on the spot. 

For instance, if a user is in India, you can show them a personalized pop-up that you created for users based in India. This will help deliver a personalized experience to them immediately in the same session. 

For more information, refer to In-session attributes.

Multi-Event Triggering

MoEngage introduces the ability to combine multiple events with logical operators for OSM and In-app campaigns. With the addition of the Filters button, you can now use the AND operator to combine multiple events to trigger your campaigns. 

For instance, you can select the In-app Clicked Android event and then use the AND operator to add the Added to Cart event. By doing this, the In-App campaign will only be shown to users who have clicked an In-App campaign on their Android device at least once and then proceeded to add an item to their cart at least once.

For more information, refer to Trigger Criteria.

Changes to Reachability and Opt-In Tracking

MoEngage improves tracking of reachability and tracking of permissions for sending push notifications.

What Are the Changes?

This change is applicable for iOS devices with SDK upgraded after April 17, 2024 only.
Web
We deprecated the Subscribed to Web Push event. Instead, this behaviour will be tracked by Subscribed to Push with event attribute Platform=“Web”.
We deprecated the Unsubscribed to Web push event. Instead, this behaviour will be tracked by Unsubscribed to Push with event attribute Platform=“Web”.

Introducing Template Groups
Existing Behavior

At times, customers run multi-locale, multi-variant email campaigns. Though they can import custom templates individually for each of these locales and variants, it is very effort-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. For example, if you want to run a campaign for 20 locales with two variants each, you must add content for 40 combinations manually. These 40 combinations are related to each other because they have the same message to be conveyed. It is common for such templates to be created together and be published in a campaign together.

Until now, templates stored in MoEngage did not have means to associate locale or variant with the template or with other templates. The email template API (V2) also did not have a provision for the customers to send this information to MoEngage.

New Behavior

In this release, MoEngage introduces Template Groups. You can create template groups by passing the locale, variant, and group_id parameters in the Create Email Template API. For more information, refer to Create Email Template API.

While creating an email campaign, this feature will allow you to import template groups into the MoEngage ecosystem and render the mapped templates together. The Template Groups feature will save you time because you need not add templates manually for all locale and variant combinations. In the above example of 40 combinations, it will take just one click to populate all of the relevant content. For more information, refer to Import and Use Template Groups in Email Content.

Introducing Domain Reputation for Email Campaigns

Domain reputation is the health of a domain as perceived by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and mailbox providers. It is a key factor that impacts email deliverability/inbox placement.

Existing Behavior

Clients did not have visibility of their domain health within the MoEngage dashboard. They could either check their domain reputation by logging into Google Postmaster or be dependent on Email Deliverability Consultants (EDC) and customer support (CS) teams to understand whether the poor performance of their campaigns was because of a bad domain reputation.

Many times clients ran email campaigns with domains having low reputation, which impacted the campaign performance adversely. In such case, clients reached out to MoEngage to know why their campaign performance was affecting badly.

New Behavior

MoEngage can now show the Domain Reputation information in the MoEngage dashboard. This feature helps marketers understand the performance of their email campaign better and reduce dependency on EDC and CS teams. For more information, refer to Domain Reputation.

The MoEngage dashboard shows the domain reputation for every verified domain:

While adding a ""from email address"" in email settings
While selecting a ""from email address"" during email campaign creation
On the All campaigns page for email campaigns
On the Campaign Analytics page to co-relate the campaign performance with the domain reputation
WhatsApp
Sinch India (ACL)

MoEngage is delighted to announce the addition of Sinch India (ACL) as a WhatsApp provider in MoEngage along with existing vendors. If you want to use this as your WhatsApp service provider, then integrate Sinch India (ACL) with MoEngage by following the steps listed here: Configure Sinch India (ACL) 

Flows
Ability to Copy and Paste a Branch

Recommendations 
Recommendation Filter

In this release, MoEngage introduces user action filters using which you can customize your recommendation results. This feature allows marketers to apply the filtering criteria on the results of the selected recommendation model.

You can now filter the recommendation results using the user action filters. This filter is based on the activities performed by users in a certain date range. This filter is applicable to the ""Item attributes"" and AI-based recommendation models. For more information, refer to Item Attribute Model, Overview - Advanced Recommendations, and Creating Advanced Recommendations.

Segmentation 
Value Suggestions Enhancements

In this release, we made the following enhancements to the value suggestions drop-down menu:

Increased the limit for selecting values in the drop-down menu: The drop-down menu previously allowed you to select 300 values. You can now select 1000 values.
Increased efficiency: Earlier you had to manually deselect the values one by one if you selected all the values from the drop-down using the condition ""in the following"". It was difficult selecting all 300 values and then deselecting all of them manually or refreshing the page. We are introducing the Select All and Clear All buttons.
Increased capability: We are introducing a new Freeform category to make entering and selecting comma-separated values easy. So we have doubled your power to create and select new values with the Freeform category with the existing Newly Created category in the drop-down menu.
Fixed critical bugs:
Value suggestions were suggested for PII masked attributes.
Due to partial matching of values, more values were getting selected if you pasted some values to be searched in the search box.

For more information, refer to Value Suggestions.

Custom Connectors
Authorization Configuration with OAuth 2.0
Customer Problems
They could not run connector campaigns with external partners that required OAuth 2.0.
They could not run campaigns for client-specific internal use cases where the client's system accepted access tokens provided from one of their authorisation services only.
New Feature

In this release, MoEngage allows you to configure OAuth 2.0 authentication services that fetch and refresh access tokens. You can also configure the access token to be refreshed based on refresh configuration and before expiry time of the access token. For more information, refer to Authorization Configuration with OAuth 2.0.

As a marketer, while creating a custom connector campaign (in step 2 Content), you can use OAuth 2.0 as authentication. For more information, refer to Create a Connector Campaign.

Ability to Carry Over Standardized UTM Parameters to Campaigns and Flows

Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) parameters are tags or simple snippet codes you can add to the end of a URL to accurately track user engagement from different traffic sources in your analytics software. There are five UTM parameters: utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_term, and utm_content.

Existing Behavior

Marketers can add UTM parameters to all links used in campaigns manually. They can have a lot of different campaigns running across multiple channels and platforms. When they add UTM parameters manually in all links used across these campaigns, it is error-prone and requires supervision by an individual.

New Behavior

MoEngage introduces a UTM parameters setting page at the account level to standardize the UTM parameters creation process. This feature reduces marketers' effort in setting up UTM parameters in each link and reduces the chances of error.

You can enable general UTM parameters at account level and define the values for campaigns and flows. You can also create custom parameters. The general UTM parameters are automatically carried over to campaigns and flows. You can override general parameters at campaign level and flow level if required. 

info	

Information

Currently, this feature is supported only for the Email channel.
The UTM parameters you configure at the account level impact standalone email campaigns and email campaigns created as part of flows.
For other campaigns, you must add UTM parameters to links manually.
If you pass any UTM parameters as part of the URL manually while creating an email campaign, MoEngage skips the automatic UTM parameters for that email campaign.
